  <title>The Glass Ocean - Beatriz Williams, Lauren Willig, Karen White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling authors of &lt;em&gt;The Forgotten Room&lt;/em&gt; comes a captivating historical mystery, infused with romance, that links the lives of three women across a century&amp;#8212;two deep in the past, one in the present&amp;#8212;to the doomed passenger liner, RMS &lt;em&gt;Lusitania&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;May 2013&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Her finances are in dire straits and bestselling author Sarah Blake is struggling to find a big idea for her next book. Desperate, she breaks the one promise she made to her Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s-stricken mother and opens an old chest that belonged to her great-grandfather, who died when the RMS &lt;em&gt;Lusitania&lt;/em&gt; was sunk by a German U-Boat in 1915. What she discovers there could change history. Sarah embarks on an ambitious journey to England to enlist the help of John Langford, a recently disgraced Member of Parliament whose family archives might contain the only key to the long-ago catastrophe. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;April 1915&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Southern belle Caroline Telfair Hochstetter&amp;#8217;s marriage is in crisis. Her formerly attentive industrialist husband, Gilbert, has become remote, pre-occupied with business . . . and something else that she can&amp;#8217;t quite put a finger on. She&amp;#8217;s hoping a trip to London in &lt;em&gt;Lusitania&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8217;s lavish first-class accommodations will help them reconnect&amp;#8212;but she can&amp;#8217;t ignore the spark she feels for her old friend, Robert Langford, who turns out to be on the same voyage. Feeling restless and longing for a different existence, Caroline is determined to stop being a bystander, and take charge of her own life. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tessa Fairweather is traveling second-class on the &lt;em&gt;Lusitania&lt;/em&gt;, returning home to Devon. Or at least, that&amp;#8217;s her story. Tessa has never left the United States and her English accent is a hasty fake. She&amp;#8217;s really Tennessee Schaff, the daughter of a roving con man, and she can steal and forge just about anything. But she&amp;#8217;s had enough. Her partner has promised that if they can pull off this one last heist aboard the &lt;em&gt;Lusitania,&lt;/em&gt; they&amp;#8217;ll finally leave the game behind. Tess desperately wants to believe that, but Tess has the uneasy feeling there&amp;#8217;s something about this job that isn&amp;#8217;t as it seems. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;em&gt;Lusitania&lt;/em&gt; steams toward its fate, three women work against time to unravel a plot that will change the course of their own lives . . . and history itself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
