  <title>The Dramatist - Ken Bruen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Seems impossible, but Jack Taylor is sober---off booze, pills, powder, and nearly off cigarettes, too. The main reason he&#39;s been able to keep clean: his dealer&#39;s in jail, which leaves Jack without a source. When that dealer calls him to Dublin and asks a favor in the soiled, sordid visiting room of Mountjoy Prison, Jack wants to tell him to take a flying leap. But he doesn&#39;t, can&#39;t, because the dealer&#39;s sister is dead, and the guards have called it &quot;death by misadventure.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dealer knows that can&#39;t be true and begs Jack to have a look, check around, see what he can find out. It&#39;s exactly what Jack does, with varying levels of success, to make a living. But he&#39;s reluctant, maybe because of who&#39;s asking or maybe because of the bad feeling growing in his gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never one to give in to bad feelings or common sense, Jack agrees to the favor, though he can&#39;t possibly know the shocking, deadly consequences he has set in motion. But he and everyone he holds dear will find out soon, sooner than anyone knows, in &lt;i&gt;The Dramatist&lt;/i&gt;, the lean and lethal fourth entry in Ken Bruen&#39;s award-winning Jack Taylor series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
