  <title>Jamaica Blue - Don Bruns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When successful and charming rock journalist Mick Sever goes to Jamaica to see the &#39;next big thing&#39;, a reggae/rap band with a flare for hypnotic beats and violent lyrics, he finds that there&#39;s more than just sun, sand and music on the island of Jamaica.  Danger, lies, sex and murder abound in the tropical paradise.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by front man Derrick Lyman, a talented and captivating performer with a radical political message, the band seems set for instant stardom.  But then a young girl is savagely murdered at an afterparty celebrating the band&#39;s first American concert in Miami. Roland Johnson, the band&#39;s security guard is caught, with a knife in his hand at the crime scene.  Roland is arrested and charged with murder.  For all involved the case is closed - all except Mick Sever.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sever, a relentless and charming sleuth, isn&#39;t convinced that the simple guard is the cold-blooded killer everyone thinks he is.  Stories of other murders and violence that follow the band lead Sever to believe there is more to the story than meets the eye.   Threatened by the band, the police, and dangerous unknown assailants, Sever with the help of his beautiful and intelligent ex-wife Ginny, is determined to learn the truth.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the world of music, with double deals, beautiful women and sexy sounds, nothing is as it seems.  Set against the exotic backdrops of Florida and Jamaica, this is an edgy, atmospheric, edge-of-your-seat mystery that will keep you guessing right up to the shocking ending.&lt;/p&gt;" />
