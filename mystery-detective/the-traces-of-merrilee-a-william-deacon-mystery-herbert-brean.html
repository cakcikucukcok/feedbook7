  <title>The Traces of Merrilee: A William Deacon Mystery - Herbert Brean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="William Deacon, magazine journalist and sometimes detective, suddenly heard himself say, &quot;Okay, if you want to sail on the Montmartre, I can get us aboard.&quot; He made one phone call, and to the bewilderment of his true love, Twit-Twit, and his true friends, Tom and Betsy Dolan, all four found themselves outward bound for Europe on the supposedly sold-out pride of the line. And thereby lies a trail to America&#39;s sexiest movie star (Merrilee), her fears of a fate worse than a fate worse than death, her nightmares that literally come true, and a Hollywood conspiracy that could baffle the C.I.A.--all packed into the wittiest, most tightly plotted mysteries of the year!&lt;P&gt; Herbert Brean was an American journalist and crime fiction writer, best known for his recurring series characters William Deacon and Reynold Frame. He was a director and former executive vice president of the Mystery Writers of America, a group for which he also taught a class in mystery writing. Aside from his seven mystery crime novels, he also published non-fiction books and articles, and mystery magazine short stories. Alfred Hitchcock used one of Brean&#39;s many articles for Life Magazine, &quot;A Case of Identity&quot; (1953) as the basis for his film The Wrong Man." />
