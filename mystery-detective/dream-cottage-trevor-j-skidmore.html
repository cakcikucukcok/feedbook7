  <title>Dream Cottage - Trevor J. Skidmore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Brock and son  were travelling by car at night through a unfamiliar area in late winter, early spring. The snow has melted and travel is relatively safe, but the nights are still subject to icy conditions. As Brock finds out having been distracted as he hits a spot of black ice. (An icing condition, whereby the road looks perfectly safe). Brock loses control of the vehicle and slams into a sand pile. His son, Tod is fast asleep in the back seat of the car and gets thrown about inside the car,(prior to seatbelts and airbag laws) causing him to bump his head. Brock on checking Tods condition after the accident, realizes that Tod is unconscious and notices the bump. Knowing a little about head injuries, he becomes increasingly concerned. He starts looking for help and unexpectedly meets Sean Logan, an old man who has a old cottage nearby. Sean saves both Brock and Tod, and puts them up for the night. In the morning, while Sean is preparing breakfast, Brock decides to go and check on the car. While surveying the damage, another stranger happens by to assist. Brock tells him of the previous evenings happenings and about Sean arriving to assist them both. The stranger, befuddled states that he lived in the area and knew nothing of Sean. At least not recently. There was a Sean mentioned in the community history, but had died when his cottage burned down more than a hundred years earlier." />
