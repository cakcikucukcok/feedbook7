  <title>Misled - Dianne Kaye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The comfort of Jade Annes mountain retreat collapses when she receives a letter from an old flame, Stephan Peltzini. As ex-coworkers, they have had no contact for five years. She has tried to forget the past and become invisible, but the letter arrives in her new name and address. It finds her like a wild animal tracking its prey. 
Stephan tells Jade she is sole heir of a family fortune in a bank in Germany. Hints about her family heirlooms to make the letter seem credible. He suggests that she travel to an abandoned farmhouse after a package of vital family information. By the time she finishes the letter, her curiosity is piqued. The car is full of gas and the farmhouse is only a days drive away. She ignores the clanging bell of better judgment and decides to retrieve the mysterious package.
Blinded by love and nave trust, she is pulled into the spiritual journey of a lifetime. She finds herself locked in an unhealthy relationship and exposed to extreme darkness. It takes a gutsy attorney, private investigation, a psychologist-priest, and a maze of courtroom drama to save her soul." />
