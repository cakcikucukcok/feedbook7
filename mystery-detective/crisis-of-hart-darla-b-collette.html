  <title>Crisis of Hart - Darla B. Collette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1988, Byron and Victoria received an amazing, selfless gift from someone unknown to them. Twenty-eight years later and now on her own, Victoria learns of the painful truth behind the gift she received all those years ago. Her world bound by safe edges, begins to unravel.   Retta Jean Hart is encouraged by her older sister to see a hypnotist. She thinks it&#39;s hokey, but wants to know the reason behind her vague memories that she&#39;s had for twenty-four years, so she does it. Four years later and under God&#39;s timing, the truth is finally unveiled and it matches with her vague memories from long ago.   A crime had taken place for personal gain and almost three decades later, it was discovered. With a thread of prayer throughout, the characters learn love, forgiveness, and how to move forward while stitching their past to the present." />
