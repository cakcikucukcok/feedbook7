  <title>Silent City: (Pete Fernandez Book 1) - Alex Segura</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;&quot;The new George Pelecanos is here.&quot; &amp;#151; Son of Spade&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pete Fernandez is a mess. He&#39;s on the brink of being fired from his middle-management newspaper job. His fianc&amp;#233;e has up and left him. Now, after the sudden death of his father, he&#39;s back in his hometown of Miami, slowly drinking himself into oblivion. But when a co-worker he barely knows asks Pete to locate a missing daughter, Pete finds himself dragged into a tale of murder, drugs, double-crosses and memories bursting from the black heart of the Miami underworld - and, shockingly, his father&#39;s past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Making it up as he goes and stumbling as often as he succeeds, Pete&#39;s surreptitious quest becomes the wake-up call he&#39;s never wanted but has always needed - but one with deadly consequences. Welcome to Silent City, a story of redemption, broken friendships, lost loves and one man&#39;s efforts to make peace with a long-buried past to save the lives of the few friends he has left. SILENT CITY is a gritty, heartfelt debut novel that harkens back to classic P.I. tales, but infused with the Miami that only Alex Segura knows.&lt;/div&gt;" />
