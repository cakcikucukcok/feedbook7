  <title>The Trap - Peter Reitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a child, Hank Baldwin was always a troublemaker. As an adult, he doesnt fare much better. He joins the familys Southern California poultry business and cares for his ailing mother, but his propensity to cause mischief never wavers. After his mothers death, though, Hank spirals into a dark depression and gets involved with the towns dark underbelly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lost and lonely, Hank becomes friends with his neighbor, Vic Carver. The two hatch a daring plan to launch a drug smuggling ring. They join forces with a drug cartel and are soon awash with money and living it up. When the friends find romance with two beautiful women, however, they decide to quit the business, get married, and have families of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Mexican drug cartel isnt willing to let them go that easily. Now Vic and Hank need to make a decision. Do they still continue with their business and put their loved ones in jeopardy, or try to end it all? The choice they make sends them to the Mexican border to wage a war they may not come out of alive.
Filled with adventure and thrills, &lt;i&gt;The Trap&lt;/i&gt; shows just how easy it is to get caughtin more ways than one.&lt;/p&gt;" />
