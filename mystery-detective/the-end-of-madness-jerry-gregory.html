  <title>The End of Madness - Jerry Gregory</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The human psyche, normally a fortress of strength, is most vulnerable when love dies. The emotionally chilling novellas in &lt;I&gt;The End of Madness&lt;/I&gt; provide glimpses into the minds of people for whom love stopped existing. &lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;The End of Madness&lt;/I&gt;, the signature story, deals with despair born of David Reeds obsessive behavior. The story follows the decline of a famous novelist who blurs the line between loving, trusting and dying. When his love affair spins out of control, soaring to a point of no return, the writer plunges an alluring mistress and a loving wife into their own brand of hell. An unexpected twist provides a gripping conclusion to this transatlantic journey into madness. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;THE VISITOR&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;In &lt;I&gt;The Visitor&lt;/I&gt;, a beautiful widow tries desperately to retain her sanity after an encounter with a strange child. Brenda Carters improbable relationship, which slowly intensifies with young Karla Adams, exploits every aspect of her existence. Fear, hope, sadness and incredible discovery highlight four decades in the life of a popular and resolute woman. Unfortunately, her quest for love also falls victim to the indomitable search for truth. Brenda is the perfect protagonist, as Cape Cod is the perfect setting, for this haunting tale that confronts the differences between reality and madness. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;THE LOCKET&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;A fanaticism born of tragedy leads a popular minister on a bizarre crusade. A respected clergymans mind discovers the darkest corner of despair after his loving wife is tragically killed. Leroy Madisons ability to traverse opposing social structures enables him to perform an inner voices unthinkable mandate. An intellectual debate, raging within a wounded heart, defines this psychological thriller. Forces of good and evil struggle to control a tormented mind, trapped in the cruelest of all placesmadness. &lt;/P&gt;" />
