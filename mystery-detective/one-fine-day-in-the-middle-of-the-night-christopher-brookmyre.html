      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Like a highball mix of Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiassen, Christopher Brookmyre is back with his most lethal book yet: One Fine Day in the Middle of the Night.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Gavin Hutchinson had it all planned out. A unique &amp;#147;floating holiday experience&amp;#8221; on a converted North Sea oil rig, a haven for tourists who want a vacation but without the hassle of actually going anywhere. And what better way to test out his venture than to host a fifteenth-year high school reunion, the biggest social event of his life, except no one remembers who Gavin is. That, and his wife has discovered his philandering ways and plans to leave Gavin with a very public announcement in front of his assembled guests. Throw in a band of mercenaries who crash the party and you have a wicked farce of a thriller from one of the most original voices in mystery fiction.&lt;/div&gt;" />
