  <title>Outerborough Blues - Andrew Cotto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A beautiful young French girl walks into a bar, nervously lights a cigarette, and begs the bartender for help in finding her missing artist brother.  In a moment of weakness, the bartender&amp;#151;a lone wolf named Caesar Stiles with a chip on his shoulder and a Sicilian family curse hanging over him&amp;#151;agrees. What follows is a stylish literary mystery set in Brooklyn on the dawn of gentrification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Caesar is initially trying to earn an honest living at the neighborhood watering hole, his world quickly unravels.  In addition to being haunted by his past, including a brother who is intent on settling an old family score, Caesar is being hunted down by a mysterious nemesis known as The Orange Man. Adding to this combustible mix, Caesar is a white man living in a deep-rooted African American community with decidedly mixed feelings about his presence.  In the course of his search for the French girl&#39;s missing brother, Caesar tumbles headlong into the shadowy depths of his newly adopted neighborhood, where he ultimately uncovers some of its most sinister secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking place over the course of a single week, &lt;I&gt;Outerborough Blues &lt;/I&gt;is a tightly paced and gritty urban noir saturated with the rough and tumble atmosphere of early 1990s Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Andrew Cotto &lt;/B&gt;has written for numerous publications, including &lt;I&gt;The New York Times&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Men&#39;s Journal&lt;/I&gt;, Salon.com, &lt;I&gt;Teachers &amp; Writers &lt;/I&gt;magazine and &lt;I&gt;The Good Men Project&lt;/I&gt;.
