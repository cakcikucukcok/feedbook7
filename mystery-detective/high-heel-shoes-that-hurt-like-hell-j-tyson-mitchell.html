  <title>High Heel Shoes That Hurt Like Hell - J Tyson Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It was exciting to teach you in the early years. During those times, I knew you were destined to do great things. Your knowledge of the English Language was obvious, even then. You have accellerated beyond your first book, revealing your ability to create fictitious characters, cast them in real-life situations and develop a story line that raises the question, IS IT FICTION OR IS IT REAL. Congratulations! God has marked you for His favor!!!&lt;br /&gt;C W Porter ---Inner City News (Retired)&lt;br /&gt;A Book Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a moving story that will make you laugh...and at times...will bring you to tears. It&#39;s a story about an unexpected inheritance that uproots Haley&#39;s life as she rediscovers who she is. This beautiful woman values family, cherishes real friendships, and is deeply blinded by color. It&#39;s a story that will give you faith that true love still exist. You will enjoy timeless music from a radio station that was once on its last leg. And even though life finally seemed wonderful, murder showed up and showed out in the worst way. See if you can guess whodunit!&lt;/p&gt;" />
