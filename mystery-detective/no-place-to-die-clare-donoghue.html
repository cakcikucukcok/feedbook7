  <title>No Place to Die - Clare Donoghue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jane Bennett, senior Detective Sergeant for the murder squad at her London police precinct, is having a terrible day. Her boss, Detective Inspector Mike Lockyer, has just returned to work after two weeks on &quot;leave,&quot; though Jane knows it was really more like a suspension. He&#39;s still shaken by the loss of a victim in their last murder case, and Jane is still stung that Lockyer didn&#39;t trust her enough to confide in her about the case before it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But neither of them has the luxury of time to dwell on past grievances. Jane has just received a phone call from a good friend saying that her husband Mark Leech, a retired policeman, has disappeared. When Jane finds dramatic blood splatters in the laundry room, she knows Mark is seriously injured at best, and they don&#39;t have any time to waste. And then the body of a young girl is discovered in a tomb under a London greenway, and police resources are stretched even thinner...until it starts to look like the two cases might be related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No Place to Die&lt;/i&gt; is another spine-tingling mystery with complex, three-dimensional characters from suspense master Clare Donoghue.&lt;/p&gt;" />
