  <title>Amish Promise: A Sequel to Amish Dilemma - Sioux Dallas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We are born, live and die as life demands. Jeremiah was born on the same night his father died. He faces a lot of pressure from older boys to leave the Amish faith. He loves his mother and his relatives, but feels he is missing something in life. Will he overcome the temptations to leave the Amish faith?  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sioux Dallas traces her ancestry back to Scotland, Holland, England and Wales. One branch of her family was traced back to the early 1400s to the Attanoughkomouck Indians. She is a widow and a retired public school teacher of both high school and grade school.  &lt;br&gt;Sioux&#39;s spirit has not been broken by cancer, broken bones or a myriad of trials and tribulations she&#39;s had to overcome. You&#39;ll never see her without a smile on her face or an encouraging word for anyone who is of need. Her love of her God and of people gives her all the peace and comfort she needs. Dallas&#39; love of church and Bible study helps her to research many interesting people. Sioux Dallas is currently working on her next novel." />
