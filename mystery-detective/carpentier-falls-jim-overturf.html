  <title>Carpentier Falls - Jim Overturf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When two homeless boys foraging for food stumble upon the body of restaurant owner Carlos Guerrero, they notify Kurt Maxxon.
Its the third time in four years that racecar driver Maxxon finds himself involved in a murder case. Carlos was a friend, and hes determined to help authorities find the killer.
A letter from Carlos addressed to Kurt surfaces, and it is the first big clue. The letter contains a set of directions; Kurt follows them and finds incriminating evidence implicating a prominent local politician, one of Carloss associates.
Kurt follows more clues in a bid to pinpoint why Carlos was killed and who should be blamed. He runs into a number of dead ends, but he continues asking questions and uncovering answers in his own unique ways.
Against this backdrop, Kurt also has another mission: to win a race at the River Flats International Speedway. Find out who wins, who loses, and who killed Carlos in the third book in the Kurt Maxxon series, &lt;i&gt;Carpentier Falls.&lt;/i&gt;" />
