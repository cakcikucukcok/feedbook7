      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The knife with the carved sheath inlaid with silver, had been driven up to its haft between the shoulders of Captain Geoffrey Hunt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johannis Kudorfer, master mariner, is a fraudster and a rogue. But that suits Sam Hartford just fine, because he is a scoundrel himself. When Sam devises a scheme to wreck a ship for the insurance money, Kudorfer is a key collaborator, along with a small gang of other miscreants and dupes, plus Lena the languid cigarette-smoking girl. But Sam is unaware that some of his trusted cohort are playing games of their own&amp;mdash;games so treacherous they will end in murder. Detective-Sergeant Woods, suspicious of the con game from the start, will need to call in Chief Inspector Thompson of Scotland Yard to solve this gritty and absorbing case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Murder by Chance&lt;/em&gt; was first published in 1936, and has remained out of print for many decades until this new edition.
