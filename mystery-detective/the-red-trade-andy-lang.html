  <title>The Red Trade - Andy Lang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Two must die so that one may live!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A truly frightening tale, more so because it is based on documented fact. The Red Trade is the heart wrenching story of a group of small children who are abducted from their homes by ruthless, heartless men, and sold for organ harvesting, sacrifice to superstition, and to satisfy the sick and twisted desires of wealthy foreigners.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anita is a happy and healthy girl, but she has a problem, something that sets her aside from her peers, an inescapable condition. Anita is white, yet her heart and blood are pure African.&lt;br /&gt;
For Anita is albino. A cursed child; an abomination.&lt;br /&gt;
Junior and Uncle are happy, carefree twins. Mischievous boys, full of life, pranks and optimism.&lt;br /&gt;
Natasha is a happy go lucky schoolgirl without a care in the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But they all share one thing in common. They are targets for The Red Trade. For a criminal gang is operating in their area, and customers around the world eagerly await.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fortunately there are people willing to stand up and shout, &amp;quot;Enough is enough,&amp;quot; Glenn Ridgely is one such man, and with the help of his street-wise Kenyan girlfriend Ruth, and world weary Kalanjin police officer, Morgan. He sets about dismantling their sinister and sordid empire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Red Trade&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A story of human trafficking that reveals hidden truths that many wish to deny exist.&lt;br /&gt;
A story that ranges from the IDP camps of northern Uganda to the wide, majestic plains of the Serengeti, and far across the Indian Ocean to distant Pakistan. A story of abuse, subjugation, cruelty and superstition, morality, and finally hope and redemption." />
