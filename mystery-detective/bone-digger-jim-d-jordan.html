  <title>Bone Digger - Jim D. Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Johnny Zen and his girlfriend Jessica Sellars are back with another adventure when they are asked by a close friend to look into the cold case murder of a college student, Hannah McGuire.   Who would want Hannah dead? From the viciousness of the crime it was obvious this was no random act of violence. Someone wanted to make sure Hannah was dead.  The main suspect at the time was Hannah&#39;s own professor and thesis advisor. But almost as quickly as he became the number one suspect, the police suddenly dropped their investigation of him and no one else ever seemed to come onto their radar.  Now fourteen years later, Johnny and Jessica start digging into the bones of the stone cold case. There are those who will stop at nothing to prevent them from revealing secrets that will change everything we&#39;ve been led to believe about 9/11.  In the quiet recesses of Johnny&#39;s mind, he must ask himself, - What if it&#39;s true?" />
