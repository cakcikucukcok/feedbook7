  <title>Shark Skin Suite - Tim Dorsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bottom feeders beware: the Sunshine State&amp;#8217;s favorite psychotic killer and lovable Floridaphile Serge Storms has found a new calling, legal eagle, and he&amp;#8217;s going to make a killing as a crusading attorney&amp;#8212;and star as a dashing lawyer on the big screen&amp;#8212;in this madcap escapade from the insanely funny &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Tim Dorsey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to swimming with the sharks, there is no bigger kahuna than Serge Storms. Binging on a marathon of legal movies set in Florida, Serge finds his calling: the law. Never mind law school or that degree, Serge becomes a freelance fixer&amp;#8212;wildcat paralegal and pilgrim to the hallowed places where legal classics of the big screen such as &lt;em&gt;Body Heat, Cool Hand Luke&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Absence of Malice&lt;/em&gt; were filmed practically in his own backyard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Serge&amp;#8217;s old flames, young lawyer Brook Campanella, is also a rising star thanks to her expertise in the field of foreclosure law. Ruthless at taking down the greedy banksters kicking people out of their homes, she lands a major class-action lawsuit, and wins big. The opposition is determined to shut her down and they&amp;#8217;ll go to extreme lengths to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily for her, Serge has been hired to do some investigative legwork on the case. There&amp;#39;s nothing he likes better than saving a damsel in distress, especially when it means kicking a bunch of shyster butt. The mayhem comes to a hilarious head at the Key West courthouse, at the height of the island&amp;#8217;s raucous Fantasy Fest street carnival, and no one, including Serge, will ever be the same.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
