  <title>The Curse of Hostal La Parata - Johnathan Currier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Paradise Mountain Resort used to be a place of peace and quiet, but now it is full of blood, anger, and distraught. 
My friends and neighbors have turned on me, and now they are trying to turn me into one of them. 
The blood shall continue to spill and pour and leave a splashy trail, until the demon known to myself and others as the man in black rules his devils playground and raises his own army of demons from the burning depths of hell. 
I must now find my way out of darkness and into the light and fight my way through the enchanted forest and rendezvous with the others before it is too late and my blood, too, is spilled upon the cobbles. 
I must now team up with the newest recruits that have been embroiled in this nightmare, which has now become my massacre, and stop this madness once and for all. 
Can Detective Nick Brown and his partner, Detective Carla Quinn, help us end this carnage before the war between evil and evil begins? Or will they also perish and burn and become a victim of pure evil? 
In this exhilarating and terrifying sequel, we try to find the answers to the questions that everyone is dying to know. 
Who is the stranger lurking in the forest and following my every move? And what is inside of the secret chest, which is hidden beyond the prison walls? 
Who will make it out alive?" />
