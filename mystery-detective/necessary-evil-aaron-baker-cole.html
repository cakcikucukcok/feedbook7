      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; There comes a time for most individuals when we weigh
our assets and concerns, and decide where to focus our
future efforts. Billy Hawkins, however, has two assets that
many would consider liabilitiesa degree of moral flexibility
and a borderline psychotic drive to protect the vulnerable. As
he enters college, Billy finds himself enraged by the increasing
reports of sexual abuse by Catholic Priests. He finds most
disturbing the Priests betrayal of children and adolescents
in their charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; After making a radical change of academic pursuits in
graduate school, Billy strikes an alliance with the director
of a Catholic seminary in southern California. Monsignor
Montalvo has been running his own crusade to encourage
the Church to mend its ways, but with little success. The pace
of &lt;i&gt;Necessary Evil&lt;/i&gt; accelerates as the activities of Billy and
Montalvo combine to provide an unmistakable message to
the Church regarding its sanctioned abuse of the young. &lt;/p&gt;" />
