  <title>Darkness the Color of Snow - Thomas Cobb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;No Country for Old Men&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Snow Falling on Cedars&lt;/em&gt;, a haunting, suspenseful, and dazzlingly written novel of secrets, corruption, tragedy, and vengeance from the author of &lt;em&gt;Crazy Heart&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;the basis of the 2009 Academy Award-winning film&amp;#8212;an electrifying crime drama and psychological thriller in which a young cop becomes the focal point for a community&amp;#8217;s grief and rage in the aftermath of a tragic accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out on a rural highway on a cold, icy night, Patrolman Ronny Forbert sits in his cruiser trying to keep warm and make time pass until his shift ends. Then a familiar beater Jeep Cherokee comes speeding over a hill, forcing the rookie cop to chase after it. The driver is his old friend turned nemesis, Matt Laferiere, the rogue son of a man as beaten down as the town itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within minutes, what begins as a clear-cut arrest for drunk driving spirals out of control into a heated argument between two young men with a troubled past and ends in a fatal hit and run on an icy stretch of blacktop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the news spreads around town, Police Chief Gordy Hawkins remains certain that Ronny Forbert followed the rules, at least most of them, and he&amp;#8217;s willing to stand by the young cop. But a few manipulative people in town see opportunity in the tragedy. As uneasy relationships, dark secrets, and old grievances reveal themselves, the people of this small, tightly woven community decide that a crime must have been committed, and someone&amp;#8212;Officer Ronny Forbert&amp;#8212;must pay a price, a choice that will hold devastating consequences for them all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
