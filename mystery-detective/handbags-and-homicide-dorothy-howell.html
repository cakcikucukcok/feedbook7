  <title>Handbags and Homicide - Dorothy Howell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Haley Randolph is always ready to go to any lengths to get the latest Louis Vuitton. Unfortunately for Haley, her life goes from glam to grim when her passion for fashion outlasts her credit cards, and she&#39;s forced to work at Holt&#39;s--a mid-market department store. Looking for a bit of shopping inspiration, Haley sneaks into the stock room to get a first glimpse of Holt&#39;s one-of-a-kind selection of handbag styles. But instead of the newest Vuitton, Haley discovers her boss is the ultimate fashion victim. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the security tapes, Haley was the only person in the stockroom before, during, and after the murder. With everyone in the store eyeing her like last season&#39;s Marc Jacobs, Haley turns to the hunky Ty Cameron, who heads up the store&#39;s loss prevention unit, to help her investigate the murder. Now her knowledge of hot trends will take her from the sales floor to the boardroom to the gritty streets of L.A.&#39;s Garment District as she searches for a killer with impeccable fashion taste.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;A winning debut.  .  .a cool cliffhanger will leave readers eager for Haley&#39;s next adventure.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt; (starred review)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Fashionistas take note: Dorothy Howell&#39;s delightful Handbags and Homicide dangles shopping to die for and a murder in store in a breezy debut mystery as sure to please as a Notorious handbag.&quot; --Carolyn Hart, author of &lt;i&gt;Death Walked In&lt;/i&gt;" />
