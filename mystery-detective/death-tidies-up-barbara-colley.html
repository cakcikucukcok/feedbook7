  <title>Death Tidies Up - Barbara Colley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Between running her maid service (the successful Maid-for-a-Day) and fretting about her upcoming birthday (the dreaded 6-0), Charlotte LaRue doesn&#39;t have much time for gossip. But New Orleans&#39;s latest dust-up is hard to ignore--especially since it involves Marian Hebert, one of Charlotte&#39;s new clients. Turns out Marian&#39;s now-deceased husband once worked for his best friend Drew Bergeron&#39;s real-estate agency--and when the business deal soured, so did the friendship. The whole sordid affair came to an unfortunate end when Drew died in a plane crash--and Bill Hebert was killed in what some people insist on calling an accident. Others are convinced it was murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pretty juicy stuff, right? Charlotte doesn&#39;t think so. She&#39;s trying her best to forget all the rumors--she has more important things to worry about these days. Like vacuuming, window-washing.  .  .and her new job at the old Devilier house. The gorgeous historic home is being transformed into luxury apartments, and Maid-for-a-Day is in charge of the cleanup. Should be easy enough, Charlotte thinks--until she finds a barely-cold corpse in one of the closets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The police are sure the dead man is Drew Bergeron. Funny, considering Drew supposedly died years ago--and Charlotte distinctly remembers attending his funeral. Talk about messy. Suddenly all that gossip about the Heberts and Bergerons seems incredibly timely--and Charlotte wishes she&#39;d listened just a little bit closer.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With old rivalries flaring--and past secrets suddenly back in the present--Charlotte has a feeling this job will involve some real dirty work. Good thing she has a knack for cleaning up crimes.  .  ." />
