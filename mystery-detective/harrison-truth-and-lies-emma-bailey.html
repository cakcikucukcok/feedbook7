  <title>Harrison, Truth and Lies - Emma Bailey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="~Every time I slip, I surrender. And each time I slip, I worry that I&#39;ll fall.~  If you were on the verge of insanity, would you give into the voice in your head? Harrison Gold has been branded as a vigilante, and a target to the entire city. Are actions justified if it was an act of self defence? Will she finally get pushed to the brink of madness? Every action, every decision she makes has devastating consequences on the ones that she loves. How long will it take before she realizes that some people just aren&#39;t worth saving? Her only friends are from a criminal background. Now she&#39;s constantly asking herself if she should believe those who influenced her change of behaviour, or if she should choose her own way out of the Brightfell contract list. It&#39;s going to take Harrison more than just her quick wits and increased stamina to get out of this hole. With one mistake leading to an all-out man-hunt for the previous WM Media writer, is the vigilante known as &#39;Hatchet&#39; finally going to meet her demise?" />
