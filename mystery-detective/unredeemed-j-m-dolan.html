  <title>Unredeemed - J M Dolan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Just when everything is going well in her life, researcher Jamee Blair is forced to become an amateur detective after the live-in caregiver hired for her sister’s medical crisis, vanishes. To track down the truth of the missing caregiver, Jamee enlists the help of modern day highlander, Samuel Craig, a politician appointed investigator into human trafficking links to international organized crime. Together, Jamee and Sam embark on a disturbing search for Odessa and, as the mystery unfolds, they find themselves navigating the twists and turns of Canada’s seedy underground immigration. Jamee’s comedy filled one-line zingers, aimed to keep Sam at arms distance, become a second chance at happiness. When a casino chip is found with the body, Sam suspects more than a simple homicide, and when a second crime scene is discovered on a suburban Calgary beach, the search leads to so much more. In this romantic thriller, the unlikely pair uncover a conspiracy that involves murder, assassins, spies and espionage. If you like Janet Evanovich&#39;s one-line zingers or David Baldacci&#39;s fast-paced style, you&#39;ll love the romantic suspense and intrigue of Unredeemed by J M Dolan." />
