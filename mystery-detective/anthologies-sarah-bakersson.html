  <title>Anthologies - Sarah Bakersson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a box set or bundle of several books in the fantasy, contemporary, horror, mystery, and romance genre, just for some variety. You&amp;rsquo;ll get the following volumes:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fantasy book 1: Dreamy fantasy stories have actually been a trend. They&amp;rsquo;ve inspired millions. As opposed to the lengthy novels, these stories are short but cut to the chase in an instant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fantasy book 2: Take yourself to a random realm where impossible things become possible. Dare to dream and imagine things that couldn&amp;rsquo;t exist in our present existence. In this fantasy anthology, some young heroes as well as heroines come around in these epic stories; they locate clues and handle challenges, enchanting or mundane, in this action-packed urban dream anthology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Contemporary: All of them evolve around themes you may be familiar with in your own life. In a fictional setting, these issues come to light to help you think and enjoy the entertainment value of it at the same time. Such issues include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
- Rebellion, pop-culture, being different, and dealing with special gifts.&lt;br /&gt;
- Loneliness, being an orphan, and being rejected.&lt;br /&gt;
- Becoming extremely wealthy, famous, or talented.&lt;br /&gt;
- Sexual themes related to the law of attraction and the importance of it in someone&amp;#39;s life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Horror: This anthology of short stories contains many different elements readers of the horror and mystery genre will enjoy, such as:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
- Time travel and playing around with the change of events.&lt;br /&gt;
- Zombies and outbreaks of the undead in apocalyptic scenarios.&lt;br /&gt;
- Survival in times when things get tough.&lt;br /&gt;
- Ghosts and the appearance of those from the other side to warn and scare their victims.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mystery: Entertain yourself by reading or listening to these short stories that all contain one or more secrets: A murder, a theft, a hidden identity, or some mystical disappearance. Dive beneath the world of lies and spark your curiosity as you keep reading and satisfy your cravings for closure. These stories contain elements such as:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
- The search for magical items that could instantly change a person&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;br /&gt;
- Vanishing items that need to be retrieved.&lt;br /&gt;
- Detective searches for perpetrators and suspects.&lt;br /&gt;
- Misleading tricks from double-agents to get to the bottom of a con.&lt;br /&gt;
- Murder mysteries with motives, who-done-it settings, lies, and cover-ups.&lt;br /&gt;
- Conspiracies and hidden agendas.&lt;br /&gt;
- A werewolf and the puzzle of figuring out who it is.&lt;br /&gt;
- Unexpected plot twists about presumptions of labelling certain parties as the good guys or the bad guys.&lt;br /&gt;
- Police investigations and car chases.&lt;br /&gt;
- Magical and supernatural powers and intricate disasters.&lt;br /&gt;
- And so much more!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Romance: While reading through several short stories, you will come across a series of emotions, highlights, and communication differences that will set these tales apart from others, still allowing you to bask of the generous light of the genre you are attached to. Such highlights and happenings include things like:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
- Arguing, resisting, kissing, and making up.&lt;br /&gt;
- Marriage proposals, and the entire game leading towards that special moment.&lt;br /&gt;
- Princesses in castles who don&amp;rsquo;t feel like they get what they deserve.&lt;br /&gt;
- Vampires and their peculiar dealings with actual human beings.&lt;br /&gt;
- Perspectives from males and females who experience the same occurrence but feel differently about it.&lt;br /&gt;
- Cross-cultural relationships and particular feelings attached to them." />
