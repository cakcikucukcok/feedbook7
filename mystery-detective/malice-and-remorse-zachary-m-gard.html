  <title>Malice and Remorse - Zachary M. Gard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For Jack Gardner, everything in his life seems to be going perfectly. He marries his college sweetheart, Melanie Stole; begins a promising career; and has the blessing of long-time best friend, Craig Sanderson. But Jacks perfect life shatters the day his wife is raped and murdered allegedly by Craig, a man he has known and been friends with for most of his life.
With his wifes murder and his friends betrayal, Jack struggles to cope. Through a horrific trial, Jack relives the tragedy as the prosecutions star witness. Craigs conviction seems certain, but Joseph West, Craigs defense attorney, and rookie police officer Travis Denton think there is much more to the story. The details just dont add up. They investigate endlessly looking for new leads to solve what they believe to be a case of wrongful accusation.  
As West and Denton begin to unravel the case, they are shocked to learn the secrets of why the woman was killed, and they come to grips with the idea that people are not always who they appear to be." />
