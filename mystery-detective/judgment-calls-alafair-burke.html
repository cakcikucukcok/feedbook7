  <title>Judgment Calls - Alafair Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A seemingly simple assault case spirals into a complex web of violence and deception in this bold debut thriller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deputy District Attorney Samantha Kincaid walks into her office in Portland&#39;s Drug and Vice Division one Monday morning to find three police officers waiting for her. A thirteen-year-old girl has been brutally attacked and left for dead on the city&#39;s outskirts. Given the lack of evidence, most lawyers would settle for an assault charge; Samantha, unnerved by the viciousness of the crime, decides to go for attempted murder. But as she prepares for the trial, she uncovers a dangerous trail leading to a high-profile death penalty case, a prostitution ring of underage girls, and a possible serial killer. And she finds her judgment--not only in matters of the law but in her personal life--called into question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Samantha Kincaid, Alafair Burke has created a complex, appealing character--a woman consumed by a sense of justice, who is also tough enough to take on a man&#39;s world. Seamlessly juxtaposing courtroom scenes with those of criminal investigation, &lt;i&gt;Judgment Calls&lt;/i&gt; reveals not only an insider&#39;s knowledge of the criminal justice system but a fresh new voice in the world of crime writing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
