  <title>Once Were Cops - Ken Bruen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Michael O&#39;Shea is a member of Ireland&#39;s police force, known as The Guards. He&#39;s also a sociopath who walks a knife edge between sanity and all-out mayhem. When an exchange program is initiated and twenty Guards come to America and twenty cops from the States go to Ireland, Shay, as he&#39;s known, has his lifelong dream come true--he becomes a member of the NYPD. But Shay&#39;s dream is about to become New York&#39;s nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paired with an unstable cop nicknamed Kebar for his liberal use of a short, lethal metal stick called a K-bar, the two unlikely partners become a devastatingly effective force in the war against crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kebar harbors a dangerous secret: he&#39;s sold out to the mob to help his sister. Her rape and beating leaves her in a coma and pushes an already unstable Kebar over the edge just as Shea&#39;s dark secrets threaten boil over and into the streets of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Once Were Cops&lt;/i&gt; melds the street poetry of Brooklyn and Dublin into a fast-paced, incomparable hard-boiled novel. This is Ken Bruen at his best.&lt;/p&gt;" />
