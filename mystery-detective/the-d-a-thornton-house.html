      <meta name="description" content="Becky Simone is a beautiful intelligent woman who likes to be in control. When her heart is broken for the first time, Becky is devastated and decides it&#39;s time for a change. She returns to school to obtain a law degree and becomes a prosecutor for the District Attorney of Phoenix. She gains everyone&#39;s respect after convicting a brutal gang leader of murder. When rumors surface that there is a contract out on Becky&#39;s life, her boss sends her to Wichita, Kansas to get her out of town. Becky then decides to drive back to Phoenix and the plan is going fine until her rental car suddenly dies in the midst of an unexpected blizzard. She is sitting alone on a dark road close to freezing to death until a stranger arrives on a horse and carries her to safety. 	The next morning Becky is on her way back to Phoenix with a man she barely knows. They are completely unaware of the SUV following discreetly behind them. The next couple of days will be a nightmare for Becky as she escapes one plot on her life to another." />
