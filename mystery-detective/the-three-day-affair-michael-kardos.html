  <title>The Three-Day Affair - Michael Kardos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;A gripping debut thriller about four longtime friends who make one mistake, forcing them to face down old grudges and make horrifying choices that could haunt them forever.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Will, Jeffrey, Evan and Nolan have been friends since their undergrad days at Princeton. Since graduation they then have each forged new lives and careers. Will is a failed musician still reeling from the tragic death of a bandmate, Jeffrey got lucky and then rich from the dot-com boom, Nolan is a state senator with national aspirations, and Evan is about to make partner at a major New York law firm. Their friendships have bent without breaking for years, until one shocking moment changes everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One night on a drive, they make a routine stop at a convenience store. Within moments, a manic Jeffrey emerges, dragging a young woman with him. He shoves her into Will&amp;#8217;s car and shouts a single word: &amp;#147;Drive!&amp;#8221; Shaken and confused, Will obeys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Suddenly four men find themselves completely out of their element, holding a young girl hostage without the slightest idea of what to do next or why she&amp;#8217;s there to begin with. They&amp;#8217;re already guilty of kidnapping and robbery; it&amp;#8217;s only a matter of time before they find out the terrible depths of what else they might be capable of. For these men, three days will decide their fate&amp;#151;between freedom and prison, innocence and guilt&amp;#133;and life and death. The Three-Day Affair marks the emergence of a truly talented new crime writer in Michael Kardos.&lt;/div&gt;" />
