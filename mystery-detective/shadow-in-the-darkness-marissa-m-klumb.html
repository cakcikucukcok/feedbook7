  <title>Shadow in the Darkness - Marissa M. Klumb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While her parents are gone to Washington, DC, on business, fifteen-year-old Chessy is home alone in the small town of Brooklyn Tops. Shes not scared to be by herself, and one day, she decides to go roller-skating outside. Thats when things start getting weird.
Not only is it really quiet, but there arent any cars on the road or people walking around. Chessy isnt sure whats going on, especially when she finds a stray dog with a tag that reads, Kidnapped1819 Shadow Book Avenue. Even worse, she encounters a ghost in her house that night.
It looks like everyone in town has been kidnapped, so Chessy puts on her detective hat and starts investigating. She visits the address on the dogs collarone of the spookiest places in town, a building ten stories high with ten rooms per floor. But the one person Chessy never expects to see when she enters the house was her friend Leslie. Even worse, a ghost has taken over Leslies body!
A kidnapped town, a stray dog, a spooky building, and ghosts galorehow do they all fit together? Chessy had better solve this mystery fast before she not only loses her best friend but her whole town!" />
