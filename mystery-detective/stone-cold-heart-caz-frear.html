  <title>Stone Cold Heart - Caz Frear</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the beloved and internationally bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Sweet Little Lies&lt;/em&gt; comes the second novel featuring DC Cat Kinsella&amp;#8212;an investigator &amp;#8220;on par with Susie Steiner&amp;#8217;s and Tana French&amp;#8217;s female detectives&amp;#8221; (&lt;em&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a brief stint in the Mayor&amp;#8217;s Office, Detective Constable Cat Kinsella is back at the London Metropolitan Police, wisecracking with her partner Luigi Parnell and trying to avoid the wrath of the boss, DI Kate Steele. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for Cat and Parnell, it&amp;#8217;s serious business when a young Australian woman turns up dead after a party thrown by her new boss. The initial investigation of Naomi Lockhart&#39;s murder points to Joseph Madden, the owner of a coffee shop around the corner from police headquarters. Madden insists he&amp;#8217;s innocent, that he was home with his wife Rachel at the time of the murder. When police question her, Rachel contradicts his alibi, swearing that she was home alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the team builds its case against Joseph, Cat is tasked with getting to the heart of the Maddens&amp;#8217; marriage. Cat knows that one of them is lying&amp;#8212;but the question of which one, and why, is far more complicated than she could have expected. As she tries to balance the demands of the investigation with a budding romance and unresolved family drama, Cat has to decide how far she&amp;#8217;ll go to keep her own past mistakes buried. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her trademark wit and brilliant plotting, Caz Frear ratchets up the tension and keeps you guessing as she explores the secrets we keep from our loved ones&amp;#8212;and the ones we&amp;#8217;d kill to keep safe in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;" />
