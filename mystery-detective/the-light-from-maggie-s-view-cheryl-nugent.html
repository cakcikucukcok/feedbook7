  <title>The Light from Maggie’S View - Cheryl Nugent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1958, best friends Veronica Ricky Cooper and Ann Sympson spend their days swimming, watching movies on TV and exploring the safe neighborhoods in the borough of Kentbury, a small New Jersey town, rich in history and romantic legends. But only two days after they visit the beautiful estate of Maggies View, the body of a murdered girl is found there and the town is sent reeling. Before they know it, Ricky and Ann are embroiled in the mystery, learning new words like &lt;i&gt;circumstantial, embezzle and incest&lt;/i&gt;. In spite of the loving friends and family who surround them, darkness and betrayal creep into their lives, chipping away at their innocence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doors of Maggies View open for Ricky and Ann as they glimpse a world they thought only existed in the movies. They make new friends at the historic mansion, including the engaging Mrs. Tutbury; a mysterious Englishwoman; and a witty detective from Brooklyn who will add his own expertise to the murder investigation. But another girl will die; the murder count rises and Ricky and Ann could be next, when they naively walk into the murderers web of treachery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in the Rolling Hills of Hunterdon County, Kentbury is a fictional town created from the authors intimate knowledge of that notable area. Come along and enjoy gentle history lessons, meet colorful personalities, delve into local politics and discover the evil that can exist, even in a quiet little country town.&lt;/p&gt;" />
