  <title>She Doesn’T Like What I Do - Abdirahman Yosouf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Andrew, one of the most prosperous men in his country, is convinced he does not need all his wealth. After his parents fight over and ultimately sacrifice their lives for their money, Andrew exchanges it all for coins made of diamonds and embarks on a suicide mission that culminates in a horrific car accident. When a woman stops to help him on the side of the road and does not steal his coins, Andrew begins a quest to find her, for he knows she is not like any other human he has ever met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Andrew desperately searches his city for six months, he finally finds Aubrey at a party. But when the hostesss home suddenly catches fire, Aubrey blames Andrew and shuns his attempts to tell her he loves her. Andrew, never one to be swayed from pursuing love, continues to try to win Aubreys affection. When a tragedy prompts Aubrey to quit her job as a teacher, Andrew finally finds a way to convince her she can trust him  or so he thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She Doesnt Like What I Do shares the compelling tale of a wealthy mans journey to find true love as he discovers that everything worth waiting for does not come easily.&lt;/p&gt;" />
