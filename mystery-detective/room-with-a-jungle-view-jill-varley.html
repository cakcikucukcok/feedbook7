  <title>Room with a Jungle View - Jill Varley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Shane Campbell is staring down the barrel of her early thirties, unhappy with her life. Her promising career is on hold, and personal relationships are strained - all because of her party-girl ways. Realizing it is time for a change, she takes a New Years oath to give up her beloved alcohol. Starting her adult life over is full of promise and potential, until she sees that it is a task that is easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, however, Shane has no choice but to stick to her resolution. She is suddenly kidnapped in a case of mistaken identity and shipped to Central America. Amid rough conditions, cold-turkey sobriety and torturous treatment, Shane is determined to unravel the mystery behind her kidnapping, all the while protecting the true target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desperate to save herself, Shane must find the strength to fight for the new life she knows she deserves, as well as her freedom. She doesnt have much time to plan her escape before her captors, her own inner demons or her deteriorating health, bring an end to her life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
