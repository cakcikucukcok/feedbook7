  <title>Listen with Your Eyes - Jennie Lea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marys life was all mapped out; she knew where she was going and what she was going to do. But all that has changed nowher aunt who had raised her since she was orphaned as a baby had died suddenly of cancer. But Mary hadnt been born in Australia, and everything she thought she knew about herself was wrong. She was born in Ireland and was now the lady of a grand manor house on a large Irish estate. 
However, everyone in Ireland believed she had died as a baby and was buried beside her parents in the village cemetery. Something was terribly wrong. Is she the person she has believed she is? Who is the baby buried beside her parents, and who is stalking her, watching her every move from the cover of the shrubs and trees, and what is his intent?
Mark has also arrived from Australia; hes tall, dark, and very handsome, and shes not the only person to fall under his spell. She has a rival for his heart and the perfect body who fits so well into his riding britches. How the girls wish they could ride him as easily as they could ride their own horses.
The Manor House is now an international five-star motel and function center, and working conditions are better than most places in Ireland, but few, if any, of locals will work there. Something bad had happened there on the hill the Manor had been built on, so few dared enter." />
