  <title>Sudden Darkness - L. R. Erdmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its a slow day when private investigator Bill Radner and his friend John Cleveland meet Alice Johnson. Shes concerned over a letter received from her brother--a letter that was cruel and sounded nothing like him. Even though Radner suspects no more than a family argument, he agrees to look into her case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out Radner was right to work for Alice. Her brother, Adam, is not only a successful trader on the Chicago Exchange but hes also the leader of a satanic cult. Radner enlists the help of Bishop Mark Frazer, and soon, the PI, his pal Cleveland, and a man of the cloth are embroiled in a scandal of devil worship and murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good thing Radner has some ideas. Theyre going to need to trap Adam before he can kill Alice. The perfect time to do so will be during a ritual sacrifice at Adams home in Wisconsin on Halloween. It wont be easy, not with Adams legion of followers, but Radner has backup and a full proof plan to stop this evil mastermind.&lt;/p&gt;" />
