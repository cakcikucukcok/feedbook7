  <title>A Sense of Entitlement - Anna Loan-Wilsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Traveling secretary and dilettante detective Hattie Davish is bringing her talents to a small New England town whose wealthy residents have more secrets than they do money.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Hattie Davish&#39;s job takes her to Newport, Rhode Island, she welcomes the opportunity for a semi-vacation, and perhaps even a summer romance. But her hopes for relaxation are dashed when she learns that members of the local labor unions are at odds with Newport&#39;s gentry. Amidst flaring tensions, an explosion rocks the wharf. In the ensuing turmoil, Mr. Harland Whitwell, one of Newport&#39;s most eminent citizens, is found stabbed to death, his hands clutching a strike pamphlet. All signs point to a vengeful union member bent on taking down the aristocracy, but Hattie starts digging and finds a few skeletons in the closets of the impeccable Whitwell mansion. As she strikes down the whispers spilling out of Newport&#39;s rumor mill, she&#39;ll uncover a truth more scandalous than anyone imagined--and a killer with a rapacious sense of entitlement.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise For A Lack Of Temperance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Delightful.  .  .cozy fans will eagerly await Hattie&#39;s next adventure.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;This historical cozy debut showcases the author&#39;s superb research.
