  <title>Murder at Willow Slough - Josh Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Gay reporter, a Straight cop and thirteen dead men: will the good guys get the killers, or will the killers get them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Foster has a lot going for himhes young, blond and handsome, with an exciting career as a journalist. Then his life falls apart.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Kent Kessler is a winner, too, a good-looking athlete and the youngest sergeant in state police history. Assigned to investigate a Gay murder, he comes up clueless. He teams with Jamie to track down the killer, and soon confronts a mind-boggling conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&lt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;b&gt;Murder at Willow Slough&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/I&gt; is simultaneously terrifying, tough and tender, as two very different men stare down danger and discover the truth: the only defense against evil is people who care for each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A gripping mystery that will keep fans of the genre enthralled from first page to last. Added to the mix is a warm romance... (Jamie) Foster finds himself face to face with the enemy in a heart-stopping scene that will have you on the edge of your seat... You&#39;ll find yourself often holding your breath.&quot;&lt;I&gt;The Letter&lt;/I&gt; (Louisville, KY)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;For those who enjoy a good suspense book, this is it. And for those who enjoy a nice romance book (along the lines of &lt;I&gt;The Front Runner&lt;/I&gt;), this is it.&quot;&lt;I&gt;Columbus Alive&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The novel is a solid mystery, with believable characters and tremendous suspense. Readers will appreciate Thomas&#39; wit and the characters he creates--as well as a story that will stay with them long after the novel ends.&quot;&lt;I&gt;Nuvo Newsweekly&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are distinct flashes of Thomas Harris-like brilliance here, bringing to mind the evil exuding from the pages when Hannibal Lecter did something naughty. There are twists and turns aplenty. There are secrets within conspiracies, and many of the characters are not what they seem to be.&quot;&lt;I&gt;Gay Peoples Chronicle&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
