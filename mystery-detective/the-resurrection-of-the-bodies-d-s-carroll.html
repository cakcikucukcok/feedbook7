  <title>The Resurrection of the Bodies - D. S. Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Resurrection of the Bodies
An apparent double homicide is blended with theology in this fast-paced mystery. Wes Rinearson is a witty but implacable detective searching for a pair of women who have vanished after facing infidelity and furious quarrels that involve a pastor and an Imam. One apparent victim, judging from her notes and photos, is a woman that Rinearson would have loved to meeta pastors daughter studying for her doctorate in divinity by testing male fidelity and faith with grim results. Rinearson (French for son of a fox) explodes a minefield of deceptions and predicts the resurrection of the bodies while exploring questions central to the story. What has happened in a setting zoned for Yahweh, God, and Allah featuring a synagogue, church, mosque, and Mormon ward? What can explain an also missing multi-millionaire whose Garden-of-Eden-like estate is right between the Imams mosque and pastors rectory, where the pastors wife and daughter may have died? Rinearson realizes that the animosity exceeds the bitterest emotions in his previous hundred cases. He foresees that it will turn some simulated murders into actual corpses, but his warnings cant avert an ever-deadlier duel between the multi-millionaire, the Imam at the mosque, and the divinity student. By the time the story ends, Rinearson and the divinity student understand that they have grappled not with garden-variety suspects but with lethal kinds of faith involving God and Allah." />
