  <title>Deadly Motivations - Philip Schulman Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Daniel Whitacore is a brilliant oncologist who discovers a way to use a deadly virus to treat lymphoma. His discovery is a miracle to those who suffer from the devastating disease. Unfortunately, Daniel has enemies. These enemies hope to alter his miracle cure to make it something deadly to harm Daniel as well as the entirety of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only must Daniel fear those who mean him harm, but also, he must be wary of those closest to him. John Abel is Daniels devoted fellow, but even he soon gets caught up in the plot and becomes an unwilling conduit to its execution. Johns girlfriend, Susan, is a Harvard educated PhD. She may be smart, but can she be trusted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An outside force, Peter Sutter, recently lost his son to cancer, and he seeks revenge against Daniel, much like the others who would use his miracle cure to kill. Then, there is Jack Comstock: a jihadist conflicted as to his motivations and the ramifications of his actions. All of these people are soon intertwined by Daniels scientific discovery, but will any of them get what they truly want?&lt;/p&gt;" />
