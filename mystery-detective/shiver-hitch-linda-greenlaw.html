  <title>Shiver Hitch - Linda Greenlaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jane Bunker thought she&#39;d escaped the pollution, noise, and dead bodies of the big city when she left her job as a Miami homicide detective and moved back to the idyllic town of Green Haven, Maine. But through her work as a marine insurance investigator, it appears she&#39;s left behind the bustle of the city, but not the murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Jane is called to the remote Acadia Island to assess the damages from a house fire, she also finds a badly burned body in the charred rubble, and it turns out that the victim is the owner of the house, a wealthy woman who just happens to be one of the most hated women in town. As Jane investigates further, she becomes embroiled in a plot as thick as New England clam chowder, which involves convicted felons, a real estate scam, and the deep conflicts between the locals and the summer folks. On top of trying to find what might be a murderer on the loose, Jane is still living with her bonkers landlords, the Vickersons, who are delighted when Jane finds out that her brother Wally (who has Down&#39;s syndrome) is going to move in with them, after losing his assisted living arrangement. It&#39;s all Jane can do to keep all the moving pieces together, much less figure out who would want to burn someone alive--and why.&lt;/p&gt;" />
