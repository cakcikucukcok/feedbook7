  <title>Skinny Dipping with Murder - Auralee Wallace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Otter Lake, where the relaxing, restorative atmosphere is to die for.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erica Bloom is in no rush to return to Otter Lake, the site of her mother&#39;s spiritual retreat for women. Erica met her inner goddess years ago and she&#39;s happy to have forged a new identity on her own, thank you very much. But her new-age-y, well-meaning mother is losing her grip on the business, and needs Erica&#39;s help. So she heads back to her New Hampshire hometown, where nothing much has changed-except for maybe the body in the well... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;SKINNY DIPPING WITH MURDER&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When Erica was a teenager, she fell prey to a practical joke that left her near-naked in Otter Lake&#39;s annual Raspberry Social. The incident was humiliating, but it wasn&#39;t like anyone got killed-until now. Those who were behind that long-ago prank are starting to turn up dead, and Erica&#39;s appearance in town makes her a prime suspect. To make matters worse, the town sheriff just happens to be Erica&#39;s old nemesis, Grady Forrester...who also happens to be hotter than ever. Can Erica find a way to dig up the truth-before someone digs her grave?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first book in Auralee Wallace&#39;s Otter Lake Mystery series is a killer good time!&lt;/p&gt;" />
