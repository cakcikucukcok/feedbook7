      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pretensions, conspiracy, lies ... all play a part in this riveting book that kicks off TouchWood Editions’ new mystery series featuring Coast Salish investigator Silas Seaweed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A billionaire’s daughter with an unsavoury past has mysteriously disappeared. Silas Seaweed, a savvy, street-smart investigator based in Victoria, B.C., is put on the case. His search for the young woman leads him on a trail of murder, greed and obsessive violence. Overcoming such obstacles as a pair of ruthless cocaine dealers, the murder of key witnesses and a failed attempt on his own life, Seaweed perseveres in his quest to bring a master criminal to justice, his journey taking him from the darker side of Victoria’s downtown to Nevada’s glittering casinos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blending modern-day crime detection with age-old Coast Salish ritual, &lt;i&gt;Seaweed on the Street&lt;/i&gt; is an absorbing, suspenseful page-turner with a pace that never lets up from the first page to the last. &lt;/p&gt;" />
