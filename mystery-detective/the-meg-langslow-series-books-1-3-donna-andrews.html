Here together for the first time in a fabulous eBook bundle are books 1-3 in the Meg Langslow series:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Murder with Peacocks&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Down in her small Virginia hometown, Meg Langslow is the maid of honor at the for three of her loved ones--each of whom has dumped the planning in her capable hands. In a whirl of summer parties and picnics, Southern hospitality is strained to the limit by an offensive newcomer who hints at skeletons in the guests&#39; closets. But it seems this lady has offended one too many when she&#39;s found dead in suspicious circumstances, followed by a string of accidents--some fatal. Soon, level-headed Meg&#39;s to-do list extends from flower arrangements and bridal registries to catching a killer--before the next catered event is her own funeral...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Murder with Puffins&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/b&gt;In an attempt to get away from her family, Meg and her boyfriend go to a tiny island off the coast of Maine. What could have been a romantic getaway slowly turns into disaster.  Once there, they are marooned by a hurricane and that is only the beginning of their problems. Meg and her boyfriend arrive at the house only to discover that Meg&#39;s parents and siblings, along with their spouses are all there. When a murder takes place, Meg realizes that she and her boyfriend can no longer sit by a cozy fireplace, but must instead tramp around the muddy island to keep try and clear her father who is the chief suspect. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Revenge of the Wrought Iron Flamingos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Every year, Yorktown, Virginia, relives its role in the Revolutionary War by celebrating the anniversary of the British surrender in 1781. This year, plans include a re-enactment of the original battle and a colonial craft fair. Meg is trying to keep her father from scaring too many tourists with his impersonation of an 18th century physician. And to prevent a snooping reporter from publishing any stories about local scandals. Not to mention saving her naive brother, Rob, from the clutches of a con man who might steal the computer game he has invented. It&#39;s a tough job--at least, until the swindler is found dead, slain in Meg&#39;s booth with one of her own wrought-iron creations. Now Meg must add another item to her already lengthy to do list: &quot;Don&#39;t forget to solve the murder!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
