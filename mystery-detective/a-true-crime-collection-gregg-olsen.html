  <title>A True Crime Collection - Gregg Olsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Master true crime writer Gregg Olsen&#39;s has been hailed by Ann Rule as &quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;searing and brilliant,&quot; and this collection, featuring three of his most shocking cases, shows why.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Abandoned Prayers&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eli Stutzman, the son of an Amish bishop, was by all appearances a dedicated farmer and family man in the country&#39;s strictest religious sect. But behind his quiet façade was a man involved with pornography, sadomasochism, and drugs. After the suspicious death of his pregnant wife, Stutzman took his preschool-age son, Danny, and hit the road on a sexual odyssey ending with his conviction for murder. But the mystery of Eli Stutzman and the fate of his son didn&#39;t end on the barren Nebraska plains. It was just beginning. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Twisted Faith&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Olsen investigates the sensational story of a minister who seduced four of his female congregants, and hatched a cold-blooded plot to murder his wife: On December 26, 1997,  a house went up in flames. In it was the shy, beloved minister&#39;s wife Dawn Hacheney. When the fire was extinguished, investigators found only her charred remains. Her husband Nick was visibly devastated by the loss. What investigators failed to note, however, was that Dawn&#39;s lungs didn&#39;t contain smoke. Was she dead before the fire began?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cruel Deception&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;In and out of hospitals since birth, angelic nine-month-old Morgan Reid finally succumbed to what appeared to be Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Morgan&#39;s Texas-born mother Tanya, a nurse and devoted wife, pulled up stakes with her grieving husband Jim, and moved on. It was the best way to put the past behind them. Until their son Michael began showing signs of the same mysterious affliction that stole the life of his baby sister . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
