  <title>Shadow in the Mirror - Adele Hewett Veal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Leslee Cramer suffers from multiple personality disorder, the result of childhood abuse. Because of this illness, she has been known to find herself suddenly in strange places with no understanding of how she got there, having lost time along the way. But when she wakes up in a strange bed with a strange man who claims to be her husband, she knows something drastic has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that LeeLeslees alter egohas been in control for ten years. During that time, she married and had two children, only to have her escapades terrify the kids and alienate her husband, Kevin. Les, at sea in a life she doesnt recognize, turns to her longtime friend, Veronica Moore, for help. Along with her doctor, Alex Whitfield, Veronica is one of the few people who are aware of Less disorder. With their help, Les must find the strength to hold onto her true identity and to recover the family that she is on the brink of losing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Shadow in the Mirror&lt;/I&gt; reaches beneath the surface of one womans life and peers into the mirrored image of her soul to tell a story of love and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
