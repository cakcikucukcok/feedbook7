      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On April Fool&amp;rsquo;s Day 1983 a cruel prank goes horribly wrong and a dangerous seed is planted.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ten years later, a more sinister joke is played and six people die. The Harlequin has announced his arrival to the people of Glasgow. As a young detective constable, Tom Russell becomes embroiled in a hunt that will dog his career.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2003, the Iraq war has just begun and The Harlequin returns with his own &amp;lsquo;Shock and Awe&amp;rsquo; tactic by killing three people in the middle of a Glaswegian spring day. Russell&amp;rsquo;s previous experience means he is the perfect man to lead the investigation but he is still chasing a phantom.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Easter Monday, 2013 and The Harlequin&amp;rsquo;s end game becomes apparent. Russell is just one of his targets as he kidnaps three more victims and broadcasts to the world a horrifying game show where the only prize is to survive. Can Russell and Alex Menzies finally put an end to the Harlequin&amp;rsquo;s reign of terror?&lt;/p&gt;" />
