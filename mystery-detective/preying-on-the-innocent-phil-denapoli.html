  <title>Preying on the Innocent - Phil DeNapoli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How do you deal with a mother whose behavior fits the label sociopath? What are the chances youll follow in her footsteps? Those are the questions that haunt Maggie Egan on the day she meets Rocco DeCulloin a psychiatrists office. In spite of Roccos struggle with social anxiety, they rapidly cultivate a friendship that plunges them into the middle of a double murder.
A teenage son came home to find the beaten and butchered bodies of his parents. Maggie knows the victims as former friends of her parents. Rocco knows the son. As their connections to the murders multiply, danger threatens. When a third murder occurs, Maggies mother becomes a person of interest. Her father is the prime suspect. 
As Maggie works to clear her father, Evanston police work feverishly to make sense of the few clues they have. With the assistance of Maggie, Rocco, and ABC TV investigative reporter Sandra Anderson, they add pieces to the puzzle, but will they find a solution? And will they find the answer soon enough? As each day goes by, a sea of contamination spreads, lives are ruined, and human leeches continue to prey on the innocent." />
