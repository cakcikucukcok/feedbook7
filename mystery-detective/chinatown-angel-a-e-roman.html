  <title>Chinatown Angel - A. E. Roman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Finalist for the Shamus Award for Best First Private Eye Novel!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chico Santana is broke and brokenhearted after his wife, Ramona, leaves him. On New Year&#39;s Eve, he comes out of his self-imposed seclusion and runs into an old friend from St. Mary&#39;s Home for Boys, a member of &quot;The Dirty Dozen.&quot; Albert Garcia is now a waiter and a wannabe filmmaker, tangled up with rising film star Kirk Atlas and his wealthy, eccentric family. On learning Chico&#39;s a PI, Atlas hires him to track down his cousin Tiffany, a beautiful Chinese-Cuban-American girl who has packed up and left her family, sending letters saying she doesn&#39;t want to be found. It seems like easy dough, which Chico could use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on the night he gets the job, Atlas&#39;s Brazilian maid falls from the rooftop of her apartment in Queens. Albert and everyone else insists it was a suicide, but Chico has a bad feeling. His search for Tiffany is soon thwarted by other family members, and more disturbing and sinister details come to light. Although Chico&#39;s being paid good money to look the other way, he&#39;s driven to uncover the truth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chinatown Angel&lt;/i&gt; was a finalist for the Shamus Award for Best First Novel. A. E. Roman&#39;s debut is a fast, fun read offering an authentic, vibrant look at New York City and the wide variety of people who make up its streets, bodegas, and penthouses.&lt;/p&gt;" />
