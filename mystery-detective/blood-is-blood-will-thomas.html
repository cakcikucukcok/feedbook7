Their success, however, has led to their acquiring a powerful group of enemies, many of whom are determined to have their revenge.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one of those enemies is responsible for a bombing of their offices that puts Cyrus Barker into the hospital and endangers Thomas Llewelyn&#39;s rapidly forthcoming nuptials. To add to the confusion, Barker&#39;s long-lost brother Caleb turns up on the rubble of their doorstep not long after the not-quite-fatal bombing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsure of Caleb and warned about him by Barker, Thomas reluctantly accepts Caleb&#39;s help both with a new case that comes in as well as trying to pinpoint which of Barker&#39;s enemies is making a move against them.  As Thomas works his way through their enemy list, someone else is winnowing down that list: one by one those enemies are dying.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With time running out--and his bride-to-be reconsidering their marriage--Llewelyn must (with the sick-bed bound Barker&#39;s help) uncover the killer and the plot before it&#39;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;" />
