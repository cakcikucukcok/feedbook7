  <title>The Queen of Staves - Anne R. Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Camilla Randall Mysteries are a laugh-out-loud mashup of romantic comedy, crime fiction, and satire: Dorothy Parker meets Dorothy L. Sayers. Downwardly mobile bookstore owner and etiquette expert Camilla Randall is a magnet for murder, mayhem and Mr. Wrong. But she always solves the mystery in her quirky, but oh-so-polite way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Music blogger Ronzo never dreamed that giving an unfavorable online review to the Leftenant Froggenhall band would destroy his life. But he can only escape the band&amp;#39;s gruesome persecution and threats to his loved ones by faking his own death and living as a homeless dumpster-diver.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He&amp;#39;s forced to hide his blossoming relationship with bookstore owner Camilla Randall to keep her safe from the band&amp;#39;s vengeful clutches. Not easy when they&amp;#39;re together every day, as Ronzo&amp;#39;s unexpected tarot-reading skills keep Camilla&amp;#39;s failing Morro Bay shop afloat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When a mysterious Irish poet shows up dead on a tarot client&amp;#39;s beach, it&amp;#39;s up to secret lovers Camilla and Ronzo&amp;mdash;and the tarot cards&amp;mdash;to find the killer. Hopefully before the homicidal Froggenhalls arrive in Morro Bay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Luckily Buckingham the cat is on the case, ready to fight the bad guys, tooth and claw.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
***&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;There is a depth and freshness about Anne Allen&amp;#39;s work that makes for a pleasing surprise!&amp;quot; Poet Janice Konstantinidis&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Tremendous fun, wittily satiric and highly recommended.&amp;quot; Nigel J. Robinson&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A perfect blend of wild and wacky characters spouting hilarious dialogue while finding themselves in unpredictable and unexpected situations.&amp;quot; Paul Alan Fahey, Rainbow award-winning author of The Mother I Imagined, The Mom I Knew.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Lots of fun! Anne R. Allen is a hugely talented writer, and her Camilla Randall series never fails to entertain.&amp;quot; Claude Forthomme, senior editor, Impakter magazine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys romance, and crime suspense, with a lethally satiric edge.&amp;quot; Dr. John Yeoman, author of How Did the Author Do That?&lt;/i&gt;" />
