  <title>The Benefit of Hindsight - Susan Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;Serrailler must confront his demons as Lafferton experiences a series of shocking crimes in this 10th book in Susan Hill&#39;s shattering crime series&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;  &lt;BR /&gt; Susan Hill stuns readers once again in &lt;I&gt;The Benefit of Hindsight&lt;/I&gt;, the 10th book in her celebrated mystery series. Now recuperated after the violent incident that cost him his arm--and nearly his life--DCS Serrailler has returned to work, though he prefers to spend his spare time sketching the medieval angels being restored on the cathedral roof. With crime rates down, Lafferton has been quiet, until one night when two men open their front door to a distressing scene. Serrailler makes a serious error of judgment when handling the incident, and the stress of this, combined with the ongoing trauma of losing his arm, takes its toll. In the tradition of the fabulous mysteries of Ruth Rendell and P. D. James, &lt;I&gt;The Benefit of Hindsight&lt;/I&gt; is Susan Hill&#39;s best work yet--a chilling new addition to a highly acclaimed series.&lt;BR /&gt;  " />
