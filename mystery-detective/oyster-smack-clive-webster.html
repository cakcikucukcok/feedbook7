  <title>Oyster Smack - Clive Webster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A police detective is called to a desolate island to investigate a suspected murder. He approaches the car parked on the slipway. He peers through the misty glass. Inside, he sees two bodies, a man and a woman. He opens the passenger door. A woman&#39;s body falls out. He suddenly realises the bitter truth: the dead woman is his wife.   His long-term associate is put in charge of the investigation. Was it a mutual suicide or is there a third hand involved? Is the wealthy property developer ruthless enough to kill and are the people who work the oyster smacks just innocent fishing folk? Amidst the swirling tidal waters of the Essex coastline, the race is on to fight suspicion and local customs before the case threatens to envelop the whole island." />
