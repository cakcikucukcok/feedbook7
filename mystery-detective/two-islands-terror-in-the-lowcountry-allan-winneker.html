  <title>Two Islands: Terror in the Lowcountry - Allan Winneker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;BEAUFORT, SOUTH CAROLINA: its a quiet town, filled with southern sensibilities and the slow pace of the American Lowcountry. Jacob Lee is an attorney in Beaufort, where he lives with his wife and son. Life is gooduntil the Lee family is thrust into a terrorist plot to kidnap a high-ranking Marine Corps officer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The abduction is a ruthless attempt to avenge a Hamas terrorists imprisonment in Israel. No one would have expected such a thing to happen in Beaufort, which makes the small town such an ideal target for a surprise terrorist attack. Soon, the lives of two families are devastated by a horrific week of torture inflicted by the American-based terrorist who orchestrates the crimes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Two Islands: Terror in the Lowcountry&lt;/i&gt; presents a rare picture of radical Islamic terrorism taking place in a small, residential southern community. Soon, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security are pulled into the plot. But will they be too late to save the Lee family? Or will Jacob Lee find a way to fight the war on terror in his own backyard and send the terrorists back to where they came from?&lt;/p&gt;" />
