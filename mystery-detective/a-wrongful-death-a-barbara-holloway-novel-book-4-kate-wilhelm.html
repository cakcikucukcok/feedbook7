  <title>A Wrongful Death (A Barbara Holloway Novel, Book 4) - Kate Wilhelm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Who knew that being a Good Samaritan would lead Barbara Holloway to face her biggest challenge ever: being named prime suspect in a high-profile kidnapping?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Barbara&#39;s peace at her retreat on the Oregon coast is shattered when a terrified young boy leads her to a cabin in the woods where his battered mother has clearly been left for dead. Barbara runs for help, but by the time she returns both mother and son are gone.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The puzzle deepens when Barbara learns the boy she met is the grandson of a prominent family…and they have accused her of aiding his disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the help of her father, Frank, she delves into the mystery, only to realize the kidnapping is a ruse for a more sinister plan–one that pits the meaning of family against cold hard cash.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Troubling obstacles thwart Barbara&#39;s every move–from the justice system that employs her to the false identities of those around her. Yet none will compare with the shocking murder scene that awaits her.&lt;/p&gt;
