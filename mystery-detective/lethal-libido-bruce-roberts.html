  <title>Lethal Libido - Bruce Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt; As Jeff Collins approaches his fi fty-third birthday and thirtieth wedding anniversary, he realizes he is rapidly approaching a crisis. With both his job and marriage precariously dangling by a thread, Jeff begins drinking more than usual. Meanwhile, he cannot help but notice that there is one aspect of his life that has not yet begun to deteriorate: his libido is stuck in overdrive.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; After Jeff is involved in a confrontation at work that results in his termination, he reunites with his former college football teammate, Andy, and decides to make a million-dollar investment in his friends beer distributorship.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt; Committed to a new beginning, Jeff leaves his wife behind and relocates to Atlanta. It is not long before Jeff discovers that new beginnings mean new lovers. He meets Erin, a beautiful exotic dancer, and they quickly fall in love. Jeff has no idea that he is about to become entangled in the repercussions of Erins past life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; In this gripping tale, murder and revenge come into play in one mans obsessive search for love, and he soon realizes that the success
of his quest for happiness comes with a dangerous price.&lt;/P&gt;" />
