  <title>The Frightened Man - Kenneth Cameron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;London at the birth of the 20th century, the dying days of the old queen&amp;rsquo;s reign. It&amp;rsquo;s a city of chaos and fevered ambition, the dreams of empire mingling with the passions of scientific expansion, all to the shrill blast of industry&amp;rsquo;s factory whistle. Just the place for a man who wants to be invisible. And there are two such men. One is an American, Denton, a celebrated author desperate to escape his increasingly relentless memories. The other&amp;hellip;may not exist at all. Jack the Ripper? He hasn&amp;rsquo;t been heard of for more than 15 years; he&amp;rsquo;s just a creature of bad girls&amp;rsquo; bad dreams. But at least one ferrety little fellow claims to have seen him at his grisly work, and when a prostitute turns up dead, Denton can&amp;rsquo;t shake the notion that the frightened man may have something to be frightened about. Like Sherlock Holmes injected with some tough American moxie, Denton is an irresistible character &amp;ndash; a deeply cynical romantic with a tragic past, a wisecracking manservant, and a startling respect for women. It&amp;rsquo;s a treat to make his acquaintance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; And there are two such men.
