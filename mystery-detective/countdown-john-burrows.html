  <title>Countdown - John Burrows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Saddam Hussein sought great power and prestige in the Middle East. He had been secretly researching and developing nuclear weapons for years and he was determined to use them against Israel. He started his Middle East expansion in 1990 when he invaded Kuwait. It was obvious that Saudi Arabia would be his next target. However Saudi Arabia called in their old American and British friends who, with modern weaponry put the Iraqi military and National Guard into an embarrassing and bloody retreat. It had never been the intention of America and Britain to continue on into Iraq so Saddam was allowed to have what remained of his army. Maybe we thought that that would be the end of things but we were wrong. Saddam was hatching a devilish plan which would bring Israel, America and Britain to their knees. This story starts with three, seemingly disconnected, murders in different parts of the world and it ends with a terrible race against time in London and New York" />
