  <title>The Roma Chavi - Eva Fischer-Dixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The hopelessness and fear among the gypsies was running high as the train moved towards the unknown. All eyes in the darkness of the wagon focused on one person, an incredibly beautiful woman who called herself Salome, and who appeared out of nowhere at the detention area before their deportation. Her magical beauty was noticed right away by everyone upon their arrival to Auschwitz-Birkenau, including the young SS Colonel, Helmut von Clausen. Ignoring the objections from every cell of his body, he simply could not resist the effects of Salomes beauty. As his dark past surfaced and intertwined with Salomes magic, an unexpected metamorphosis takes place that changes everything in Helmuts life. As Helmut searches for answers, he must come to terms with his inner evil and the possibility that finding the answer to his quest for truth may cost him the ultimate price, his very own life." />
