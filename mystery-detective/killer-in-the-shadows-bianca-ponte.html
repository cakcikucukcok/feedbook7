  <title>Killer in the Shadows - Bianca Ponte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Killer in the Shadows is the story of a young man wrongly accused of murder. It is a travesty of justice when and innocent man is sent to prison.  He had to endure the horrors of life on Death Row, while the real killer got away with murder.
It all started the summer of 1984, in Miami Dade County, in a business district, off 68th. Street in West Hialeah.  The sound of gunfire disrupted the stillness of the night...  When it was over, one man laid dead, another one, critically injured, and the third one, was arrested and charged with the crimes.
It was the prelude of the ordeal to come for the accused young man.  A web of lies, jealousy, hate and revenge was weaved around him, with the purpose of incriminate him and separate him from the woman he loved.  He was tried, convicted and sentenced to die in Floridas electric chair, on the testimony of an unscrupulous eyewitness, who was lying, with the complicity of the prosecutorfor personal gains...  The other two witnesses to the crime couldnt testify on his behalf...
The young man sat on Death Row many years, hoping and praying that the truth would prevail and hed be exonerated.  Throughout those desperate times, plagued by a horrendous nightmare, living waiting to die... he was sustained by the love of his family and friends.  They stood by him, unconditionally, believing in his innocenceamong them the wife of the murdered man and a whistling ghost, who gave him hope in his worse moments of hopelessness.  But most of all by the three courageous men, who never gave up on him: his lawyer, who kept halting the state from executing him... the detective, who kept looking for the killer in the shadows... and the priest, who kept praying for a miracle.
Six year later, the young man became despondent.  Every appeal was denied, the evidence that surfaced turned out to be a dead end and the only witness left was about to die...  Under those circumstances, he decided to end it allthere was nothing more they could do for him.  He was ready to face his fate....  He was doing it for his family and friendshe wanted to set them free from their suffering... Once he was gone, they could go on with their lives and he would only be a sad memory. A date was set for his execution...
In the midst of all this, a woman from his past, came into the picture.  She teamed up with the priest and his wife and together they were going to right the wrongs people do. Faith, courage and perseverance set the stage for a confrontation that had started three decades ago in another country...  That event tore two families apart and changed their lives, drastically. Now, it was time for the final struggle: the war between the forces of good and evil... The outcome would determine if the young man lived or died... and it would reveal the truth behind a great deceit." />
