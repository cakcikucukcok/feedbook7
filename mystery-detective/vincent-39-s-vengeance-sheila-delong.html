  <title>Vincent&#39;s Vengeance - Sheila DeLong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a young nurse, SARA DAUTRY, hears about the murder of her Catholic priest, FATHER JACOBS, she wonders who would want to harm such a kind, generous person. Stricken with grief, she lost more than just her priest that day; she lost her father. When her biological father died before she was born, he stepped in and assumed the role as her father, a surrogate father. She knew she could always depend on him to be there for herand he was.
	After rushing to the crime scene, she discovers that her foster brother, VINCE ROBERTS, has been arrested for the murder. Given his mental condition, Aspergers, and his incapability to even harm a bug, she refuses to believe he committed the crime. What does she do to help him get exonerated? She implores her friends from nursing school to help her identify the true killer by traveling back, via hypnosis, to the time and place of the murder. However, she will soon regret it. When three of her friends end up dead, she thinks the deaths are related to their hypnotic experiences. But she doesnt let that stop her. Determined to free Vince, she continues her search for the killer. When she finds a miniature replica of Vincent van Goghs painting The Diggers in Father Jacobss hand, she thinks its a clue. This, along with a secret she discovers about the Shroud of Turin, causes her to think that the Vatican had something to do with the murder. To pursue their involvement further, she goes to Italy. The trip will soon prove to be more than what she expects when it jeopardizes her life. 
	To make matters worse, the FBI wants her dead. When FBI Director FRANK JOHNSON finds out about her plan to use hypnosis to reveal the murderers identity, her lifeas well as the lives of her friends and familyis again in danger. To prevent the truth about the murder from reaching the public, causing mass hysteria, Johnson devises a plan to stop her by using weather manipulation. To help him with his plan, he recruits Special Agent CARTWRIGHT KILKENNY. But his plan goes awry when the CIA gets involved. CIA Director LARRY PRICE doesnt like weather manipulation to be used on innocent civilians. When the Vatican learns that weather manipulation was used to hide evidence at the crime scene, they think the U.S. government was behind the murder. To prevent another civil war and a possible war with the Vatican, Price conducts his own investigation into the murder. With the help of his agent JASON LUNSFORD, Price discovers the extent of the FBIs involvementand it&#39;s not ethical." />
