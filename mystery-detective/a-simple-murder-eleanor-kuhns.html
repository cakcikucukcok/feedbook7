  <title>A Simple Murder - Eleanor Kuhns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, while William Rees was still recovering from his stint as a Revolutionary War soldier, his beloved wife died. Devastated, Will Rees left his son, David, in his sister&#39;s care, fled his Maine farm, and struck out for a tough but emotionally empty life as a traveling weaver. Now, upon returning unexpectedly to his farm, Rees discovers that David has been treated like a serf for years and finally ran away to join a secluded religious sect--the Shakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmed by guilt and hoping to reconcile with his son, Rees immediately follows David to the Shaker community. But when a young Shaker woman is brutally murdered shortly after Rees&#39;s arrival, Rees finds himself launched into a complicated investigation where the bodies keep multiplying, a tangled web of family connections casts suspicion on everyone, and the beautiful woman on the edge of the Shaker community might be hiding troubling ties to the victims. It quickly becomes clear that in solving Sister Chastity&#39;s murder, Rees may well expose some of the Shaker community&#39;s darkest secrets, not to mention endanger his own life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An atmospheric portrait of a compelling time in American history, &lt;i&gt;A Simple Murder&lt;/i&gt; is an outstanding debut from Eleanor Kuhns, Minotaur Books/Mystery Writers of America&#39;s 2011 First Crime Novel Competition Winner.&lt;/p&gt;" />
