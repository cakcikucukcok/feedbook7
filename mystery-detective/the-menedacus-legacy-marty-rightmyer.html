  <title>The Menedacus Legacy - Marty Rightmyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As far back as Cleo could remember she had always been focused on a 
Computer Keyboard and had long passed the stigma of a Geek. 
There was no other life for her until someone kidnapped her sister.
With her computer savvy she found her with the aid of her
system, she calls Mod.
Their past was revealed in an abduction and a twisted saga that led
to murder and mystery.
Now she and Lisa are wrapped up in another part of their lives, an ancient part.
 It is a Legacy of Treasure that has been hidden for centuries.
Cleo loves her sister and regardless of parentage she automatically jumps in to help her locate the treasure that is surrounded by cryptic clues found in the Jungle estate. 
She finds Sebastian and Love, something she never expected.
Together they find The Menedacus Legacy and much more.
