  <title>Planet Plutonia - Manny Mamuscia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From my point of view as the author, I would like for my readers to grasp the understanding that there is a Creator, call It by whatever title you like, and that everything in our world and the universes, is that It&#39;s all about change. So when change does come into your life, accept it without fear and simply deal with it as it comes along. 
     We, humans, can make change a wonderful part of our lives, without the anxiety coming in and controlling our lives. So, this is a story of our fears, or wants, change, knowing Creator does exist, as do other Beings which, are aware of all the above said, and know their duties to Creator and humanity, and all of life that may exist that we are still unawara of, as yet.
     I would also like for my readers to know that we, the peoples have all the powers to manifest whatever we desire in our lives and our world - Earth! But first, we have to accept that the possibility exists, and then we have to work on that aspect to manifest whatever we want in our individual life!
     There is at the least, one major rule in all of exsistence, though: Love is the strongest denominator which exists, and that is what we, the peoples, must focus on becomming - Beings of love, which means, &quot;do onto others better than we desire for our individual selfs!&quot;
     This is a fantasy story of truth and fantasy mixed together to elicit what Creator desired me to evok in all humanity. This must be read from begginning to the end to to not miss some important part of the story. Enjoy, and make the changes that you know need be made for your life and those around you to become better than could be hoped. Aloha!" />
