  <title>Protecting History - B. J. Chatfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;George Marsh is a middle-aged security guard used to blending into the walls at the famous British Museum. One afternoon when he secures the gallery for a VIP visitor, Marsh has no idea that the visitor is the president of the United States and that shortly after he begins his tour, he will be murdered. Now
Marsh is on the hot seat as he attempts to explain to the Secret Service how someone was able to sneak into the mummy room and assassinate the most powerful man in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
While Marsh attempts to unravel the mystery of the unexplained murder, he is interviewed by a beautiful newspaper reporter who immediately captures his attention. Unfortunately, Shelly Jenkins is hungry for success and views Marsh as her ticket to a juicy story and a front-page byline. When the pair discovers an ancient Egyptian amulet with mystical powers may be the key to understanding the assassination, they embark on a wild journey into the future where a decision awaits with the power to alter both of their lives forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this gripping tale, a museum security guard and a zealous newspaper reporter attempt to solve the mystery behind the murder of the president of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;" />
