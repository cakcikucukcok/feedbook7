  <title>Reunion - JacqueD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Sara is a sweet, but naive young girl raised all her life on the vast countryside in Virginia where neighbors are few and far in between. Until shortly after her fourteenth birthday the family relocates to a suburban area in Maryland after her father decides it&#39;s in their best interest for financial reasons. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Though Sara will miss the only life she has known, still she looks forward to the move with hopes and dreams of fitting in and making friends.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Little does anyone realize that Sara&#39;s welcoming committee will be a group of uncontrollable teens who severely bully her, and later devise a plan to commit an unspeakable crime against her that will go unpunished. Leaving Sara with emotional scars that will dwell deep inside her for years to come. Creating nightmare&#39;s that force her to relive the crimes committed against her over and over.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;No one knew the secrets she lived with, tucked away deep inside. Nor did they know that some day Sara&#39;s past would collide with her present, and that all Hell would break loose at the High School Reunion.&lt;/P&gt;" />
