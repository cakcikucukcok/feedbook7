  <title>Always Unfaithful - Hanes Segler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sheriff Paul Gimble doesn&#39;t think Hale Slayton&#39;s disappearance is anything to worry about; the wealthy old rancher is well known for overcoming everything he&#39;s encountered in eight decades of life. But when he turns up brutally murdered, the sheriff finds himself investigating the biggest crime of his career, complicated by the victim&#39;s history of womanizing, questionable energy leases, illegal alien abuse, and conflicts with everyone in the county, including his own children.&lt;/P&gt;
With the help of four young deputies, Paul plows ahead, secure in the knowledge that he is doing the right thing for the victim, his family, and the community. His thoroughness and dedication to the job earn him high marks with everyone except his girlfriend, who sees the time-consuming investigation as an example of his misplaced priorities. Adding to his difficulties, Paul is stymied by false leads and long-held misperceptions about the gruff old Texan that make the list of suspects longer than a well rope.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Always Unfaithful&lt;/I&gt; is a tale of rumors, deceit, and outright lies that lead-not very directly-to the reason for Hale Slayton&#39;s untimely death. Along the way, Sheriff Gimble finds that almost nothing is what it seems, and everything, including his own personal life is subject to a closer look.&lt;/P&gt;" />
