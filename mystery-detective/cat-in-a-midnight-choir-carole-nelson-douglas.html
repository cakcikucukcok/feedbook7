  <title>Cat in a Midnight Choir - Carole Nelson Douglas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Cat in a Midnight Choir&lt;/i&gt;, the fourteenth Midnight Louie Mystery, both feline and human evil-doers and crime-solvers work overtime to make Las Vegas the Capital of Noir Suspense. This time our feisty black cat detective is hunting a mysterious and possibly murderous organization of renegade magicians called the Synth, which has been making Las Vegas too hot to hold for some of Louie&#39;s human friends, particularly ex-magician Max Kinsella. Louie&#39;s on the case . . . but the trick may be on him this time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And just to make things interesting, while Louie and his furred cohorts battle black magic, both human and not-so-human, Louie&#39;s cherished roommate, plucky PR freelancer Temple Barr, is investigating the murderous side of the Synth despite the intense discouragement of female homicide lieutenant C. R. Molina. Molina herself is secretly moonlighting as an undercover operative to nail the killer of a sad, young stripper, and the search has boiled down to two suspects: Temple&#39;s current significant other, Max Kinsella, and Molina&#39;s long-gone ex-lover, Raf Nadir. Unfortunately, proving either man guilty will seriously impact the lives of Molina and her daughter, Mariah. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Louie and his human friends sink deeper into a lose-lose situation of crime and punishment, there doesn&#39;t seem to be any way out of this escalating crisis, except another &lt;br&gt;murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can Louie solve some nagging past mysteries, find out just what some mad magicians have in store and stop the stripper killer before he claims another victim? And what will Louie do if he finds that the killer is someone Louie knows . . . and likes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
