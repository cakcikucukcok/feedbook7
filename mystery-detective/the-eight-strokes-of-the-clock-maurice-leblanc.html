  <title>The Eight Strokes of the Clock - Maurice Leblanc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;The Eight Strokes of the Clock&amp;quot; is a collection of eight short stories by Maurice Leblanc. This thematically-related series of &amp;nbsp;short stories originally appeared in &lt;i&gt;Excelsior Magazine&lt;/i&gt; in 1922-23.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The eight tales follow the adventures of &amp;ldquo;Prince Serge Renine&amp;rdquo; (exactly what kingdom he&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be a prince of is never explained&amp;mdash;it could well be that &amp;ldquo;Prince&amp;rdquo; is just his given name. I guess that would make him &amp;ldquo;the Prince formerly known as Lupin&amp;rdquo;) and his assistant, Hortense Daniels, as they unravel eight perplexing mysteries&amp;mdash;or, rather, as &amp;ldquo;Renine&amp;rdquo; unravels them and Hortense tags along. The eight stories, even though independent, have a leading thread: Serge Renine, trying to conquer the heart of the young Hortense.&lt;br /&gt;
Chronologically, the stories are set in 1911, between Lupin&amp;rsquo;s retirement from crime at the end of &amp;quot;The Hollow Needle&amp;quot; and his greatest adventure of all, &amp;quot;813&amp;quot;." />
