  <title>Backstage Stuff - Sharon Fiffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With a divorce looming, antiques picker and P.I. Jane Wheel has been spinning her wheels, unsure what to do with herself. She could use a good shove in the right direction, and while she may know this, she isn&#39;t about to admit it. Luckily, her best friend, Tim Lowry, has her interests at heart, and he has the perfect answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does he have a mansion he needs help prepping for an estate sale, but he has unearthed an old play, a murder mystery, that he&#39;s dying to put on. The play would be just the thing to get Jane back on track--that is, if it weren&#39;t cursed. Thankfully, Tim isn&#39;t buying into any curse and pushes forward in spite of the ominous notes that keep showing up in the actors&#39; scripts warning against a performance. It&#39;s only when the show&#39;s carpenter dies in a suspicious accident that Jane is convinced someone definitely doesn&#39;t want the show to go on and might be willing to kill to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lively and intriguing as ever, Sharon Fiffer&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Backstage Stuff&lt;/i&gt; is as much fun for the puzzling mystery as it is for sneak peek at all of the surprises that Jane has collected backstage for the big show.&lt;/p&gt;" />
