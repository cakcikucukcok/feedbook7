  <title>The Gateway to Hell - Ray Mileur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mike Shannon is used to taking on the hard cases. Hes a private investigator and ex-cop in St. Louis, and when the authorities throw up their hands, Shannon is there to bring the guilty to justice. But doing whats right doesnt mean keeping your hands clean: hes stacked up quite a body count over the yearssomething hes not proud ofand its beginning to take its toll on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a teenage girl goes missing, Shannon takes what he believes will be a simple case. But when he finds cocaine hidden in the girls bedroomcocaine that apparently came from the police departments evidence roomthings begin to get complicated. Things get even worse when Shannon begins to suspect his own ex-partner, who was brutally murdered, may be linked to the girls disappearance and the stolen drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannons investigation of a possible runaway is shaping up into one hell of a case against police corruption and drug trafficking. As Shannon digs deeper, the danger escalates when he comes face to face with a dark figure from his past, a rogue CIA hitman known as the Sandman. Shannon might be in over his head, but thats never stopped him before. In all the confusion, Shannon is sure of one thing, hes not done killing yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Shannons past catches up with him, his two worlds collide and the dead bodies begin to litter the streets of St. Louis, with a trail of blood leading downtown to the Arch, The Gateway to Hell.&lt;/p&gt;" />
