  <title>Articles of Faith - Robert L. Rodin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What has long been suspected is now coming to light - that the Nazis were not the only ones who profited from their war effort; that the circles of violence reached far beyond the territories invaded by the Germans; and that the suffering continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking his cue from this growing mountain of evidence, Robert L. Rodin&#39;s &quot;Articles of Faith&quot; blends this story of greed and gold with his own father&#39;s deathbed tale of the battle he fought against the Nazis on American soil as a member of the OSS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five years after his father&#39;s suicide, Danny Maguire is raising a family of his own. A phone call on a cold winter evening shatters the steady calm. It is his father on the other end. No sooner does Sean Maguire reappear in Danny&#39;s life, then his presence threatens to destroy that life and the lives of Danny&#39;s wife and children. For with him, Sean brings a history that men of power are willing to go to desperate ends to repress. And he holds the very articles of faith that point to a sinister ring of smuggling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a story of reconciliation, a story of suspense, and a story of faith. And while it is fiction - it is perhaps not far from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
