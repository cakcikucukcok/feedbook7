  <title>The Demon of Dakar - Kjell Eriksson, Ebba Segerberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Already a huge star in Europe and the Nordic countries, Kjell Eriksson has American critics also raving, with almost every review studded with words like &quot;stunning,&quot; &quot;chilling,&quot; &quot;suspenseful,&quot; &quot;haunting,&quot; and &quot;brilliant.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Demon of Dakar&lt;/i&gt;, Ann Lindell and her motley crew of colleagues are faced with a most baffling murder case in which all clues lead straight back to a popular local restaurant named Dakar. The owner, Slobodan Andersson, has some shady connections in his past, and his partner&#39;s reputation is equally murky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kitchen crew is not above suspicion, either. The meat chef is an oddball, to say the least, while unbeknownst to the rest, the newest hire&#39;s personal life is a tangled web of lies. Even Eva Willman, the seemingly blameless older woman returning to the workforce as a waitress, has skeletons in her closet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then the tension rachets up a number of notches as it becomes apparent that one murder has not satisfied the killer in the least. If Ann is to prevent a bloodbath at Restaurant Dakar, she must match wits with a killer whose motives are seemingly completely obscure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the reader knows the killer well. His crimes are justified from his point of view. Not only that, he&#39;s a very likable fellow who is only looking for justice. As in all of Kjell Eriksson&#39;s compelling spellbinders, though, justice entails a frantic race to the finish, a race without rules and fraught with danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winner of the Swedish Academy Award for Best Crime Novel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
