  <title>Staying Power - Judith Cutler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Detective Sergeant Kate Power of Birmingham CID has had bad luck with romance, so when a polite stranger flirts with her on an airline trip home from Florence, she&#39;s more than a little suspicious. She gives the man her business card and forgets all about him. Two days later he&#39;s found hanging from a canal bridge-with Kate&#39;s card in his pocket the only means of identification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easy conclusion for the investigating officers is suicide, but Kate isn&#39;t convinced. As her subsequent investigations prove, the cause of Alan Grafton&#39;s death-and it&#39;s consequences-are more serious than she and her colleagues could have imagined. Still regarded as a newcomer in the Birmingham police force, still battling against prejudice and intimidation among the ranks, still fighting to prove that she&#39;s got what it takes, Kate is determined to stick to her guns until she finally uncovers the shocking truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judith Cutler&#39;s keen insight into the contemporary police force and her winning sleuth Kate Power are a recipe for excellent crime fiction, and &lt;i&gt;Staying Power&lt;/i&gt; is the second compelling novel in a gritty modern cop series that&#39;s been praised by critics and fans alike.&lt;/p&gt;" />
