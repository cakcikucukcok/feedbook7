So this set him on his way.
   The Redhead is about a young British girl who turned out to be more than what he was expecting. She wound up in his office needing help but was scared away by a couple of goons.
    Charlie thought he would never see her again, but this was not the case. She took him through a lot of excitement and danger, which he almost didnt survive. 
    Along the way he meets many savory characters along the way. Some were harmless and others not so much.
   He has an ex-wife and a new girlfriend to take up his off time. Charlie has to follow the clues no matter where they are.  He chase some clues to New Mexico in search of answers. Charlie still has a few army buddies he consorts with for fun and business.
