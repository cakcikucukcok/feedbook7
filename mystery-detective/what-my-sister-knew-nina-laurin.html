This is my brother as an adult, my brother who I last saw fifteen years ago after the fire that killed our parents, covered in soot, clutching a lighter in his hand, his knuckles stark white against the dirt and ash. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Everyone always said he&#39;d grow up to be a heartbreaker. But his face has gone gaunt instead. The stubble on his cheeks and chin is patchy, and his eyes look dull and dark.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  My first thought is that it&#39;s not him. Not my beautiful brother, the golden boy who everyone loved. Yet, deep down, I&#39;ve always known this would eventually happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  What did you do this time, Eli? What the hell did you do?" />
