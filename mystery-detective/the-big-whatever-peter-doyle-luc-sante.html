  <title>The Big Whatever - Peter Doyle, Luc Sante</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;When Billy Glasheen picks up a trashy paperback he finds in his cab, its plot seems weirdly familiar. One of the main characters is based on &lt;I&gt;him&lt;/I&gt; . . . Only one person knows enough about his past to have written it&amp;#151;Max, his double-crossing ex-partner in crime. But Max is dead. He famously went up in flames, along with a fortune in cash, after a bank heist. If Max is somehow still alive, Billy has a score to settle. And if he &lt;I&gt;didn&amp;#8217;t&lt;/I&gt; get fried to a crisp, maybe the money didn&amp;#8217;t either. To find out, Billy has to follow the clues in the strange little book&amp;#151;and rapidly discovers he&amp;#8217;s not the only one on Max&amp;#8217;s trail.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Big Whatever&lt;/I&gt; is the fourth instalment of Peter Doyle&amp;#8217;s acclaimed series, which has grown into an epic underground history of postwar Australia, where crooks, entertainers, scammers, corrupt cops and politicians all rub shoulders, chasing their big paydays.&lt;/div&gt;" />
