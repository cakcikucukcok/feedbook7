  <title>Harry&#39;s Secrets - Trisha J. Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stan Harris was a force to be reckoned with in these parts of London. What made him different was the way he worked behind the scenes. At the same time, he was the mastermind. He pulled many strings, his stretch reaching into Essex, Ireland and the US. Nothing went on that he didn’t know about. His brother-in-law had damaged too many people. He must deal with him as a matter of urgency. When deceit is rife among families, there aren’t too many happy endings. Kyle Brown had a good teacher in his uncle. He was determined to finish what others had started. Stan may regret the day he took him into the fold. He was more than capable of breaking a few necks, and who was going to stop him? In a world full of deceit lessons had to be learned… and taught." />
