      <meta name="description" content="INSIDE I CRIED IS A CAUTIONARY TALE OF MYTH and MAGIC that will interest you for a life time. When a scandal threatens Randall City; a struggling housekeeper, mother and employer who tries to protect a luxury mansion once known as a bed and breakfast from being defeated.

When the woman who loves him learns his dark secret, she confronts him and forces him to spill his Tea.                  
 I had just called home from the office when the breaking news arrived, and I heard someone shout with joy in the background; suddenly, there were footsteps. A whisper said to me, BE QUIET! The angel of death is still following you around. If you dig around the roots of your family tree, you might find a few bodies...
Joe is between a rock and a hard place to stay alivein a desperate bid to change Daisys impending fate. She considers anything and everything about a terrible secret that will allow death to lick Joes wounds. But its Joe who comes up with the most shocking plan of all. As the plan unfolds, things become complicated with the evil woman. She return to claim her place by Joes side and find a spot that would overtake him. But to lose the man she love could send her over the edge. 
       Look deep into a puzzle, you will find a secret that will be between us, from this day forward. Good! Its official." />
