  <title>David’S Star - Dean Zahav</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sofia, Bulgaria
&lt;P&gt;In the tumultuous year of 2020, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to fester. Fourteen-year-old Dani Madgev accidentally finds several Cyrillic letters interwoven into the graphics of the Star of David symbol. His father, Ian, a mathematical linguist, and his mother, Rovine, a cognitive scientist, help him decipher them. But none of them realize what theyre about to get themselves into.&lt;/P&gt;
Jerusalem, Israel
&lt;P&gt;To unravel the mystery of Davids Star, Dani and his parents travel to Tel Aviv, Israel. Along with Nathan Epstein, a biblical history professor at Hebrew University; Kabbalah alchemist Uri Zohar; Ruben Openheim, the head of Peace Now; and Rabbi Loew, the Madgevs make a series of further discoveries within the symbol, leading them to believe they are on the brink of knowledge that may very well change the course of history.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Meanwhile, a mysterious character called the LaW begins sending messages encoded using King Davids military cipher to Dani. Once deciphered, the messages and letters found on the Star of David point to a startling realization about the solution of the conflict between Israel and Palestine. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But are the two countries ready for the suggested solution? A domino chain of events is set in motion, and someone may have to pay the highest price.&lt;/P&gt;" />
