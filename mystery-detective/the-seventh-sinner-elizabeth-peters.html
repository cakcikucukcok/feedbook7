  <title>The Seventh Sinner - Elizabeth Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At first, Jean Suttman thought she had died and gone to Heaven when she was granted the opportunity to study in Rome. But the body that&#39;s lying in the ancient subterranean Temple of Mithra&amp;#8212;the murdered corpse of a repulsive and disliked fellow student&amp;#8212;isn&#39;t her idea of heavenly. Now she is truly frightened, not just because small &quot;accidents&quot; seem to be occurring around her with disturbing regularity. It&#39;s the ever-increasing certainty that someone, for some unknown reason, is ruthlessly determined to do her harm. Jean&#39;s innocent underground excursion into a sacred pagan place has trapped her in something dark and terrifying, and even the knowledge that practical, perceptive fellow American Jacqueline Kirby is on the case won&#39;t ease her fears. Because there&#39;s only so far Jean Suttman can run . . . and no escape for her except death.&lt;/p&gt;" />
