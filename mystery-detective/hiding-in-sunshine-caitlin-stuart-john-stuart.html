  <title>Hiding in Sunshine - Caitlin Stuart, John Stuart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Living lives of quiet affluence in a historic, suburban Boston town, Gavin and Lisa Brinkley had no idea how quickly and decisively their lives, and those of their two young daughters, could be upended.  A series of events  a mysterious break-in at their home, some menacing tailgating on the highway from Boston, a startling visit from an F.B.I. agent warning of an imminent kidnapping attempt  leads to the familys abrupt uprooting from its comfortable existence into a terrifying new existence on the run, under new identities.  This taut thriller by a father-daughter team follows the eleven-year odyssey of an American family on the run, in hiding through the mountain states of the American west,  where survival skills and living off the grid are paramount, but so are friendship, cooperation, and resilience.  The enemy, always lurking just out of sight, is a foreign cyber-criminal enterprise that launches breathtaking assaults on the American banking system and physical infrastructure, but the Brinkleys also know that the threat is deeply personal, reaching ever closer to them from the shadows of the past.  At the same time, Gavin and Lisa discover the perils of wandering too close to the edges of the dark side, in the murky world of cyber-security.   A compelling story of suspense and treachery, HIDING IN SUNSHINE is also a celebration of a familys abiding love and courage -- and a young girls faith in the triumph of the truth." />
