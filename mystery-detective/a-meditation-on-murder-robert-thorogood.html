  <title>A Meditation On Murder - Robert Thorogood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="        &lt;h2&gt;An all new &lt;em&gt;Death in Paradise&lt;/em&gt; mystery featuring DI Richard Poole.&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enhance your enjoyment of the series as, for the first time, Robert Thorogood brings the characters to life on the page in an all-new locked-room mystery. &lt;strong&gt; One murder victim, five suspects and a room no person entered or left; the classic murder in a locked room conundrum.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Aslan Kennedy has an idyllic life: leader of a spiritual retreat for wealthy holidaymakers on one of the Caribbean&#39;s most unspoilt islands, Saint Marie. Until he&#39;s murdered, that is. The case seems open and shut: when Aslan was killed he was inside a locked room with only five other people, one of whom has already confessed to the murder.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Detective Inspector Richard Poole is hot, bothered, and fed up with talking to witnesses who&#39;d rather discuss his &#39;aura&#39; than their whereabouts at the time of the murder. But he also knows that the facts of the case don&#39;t quite stack up. In fact, he&#39;s convinced that the person who&#39;s just confessed to the murder is the one person who couldn&#39;t have done it. Determined to track down the real killer, DI Poole is soon on the trail, and no stone will be left unturned.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A must read for fans of the TV series and Agatha Christie crime classics featuring Marple and Poirot.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Praise for Robert Thorogood:&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘Very funny and dark with great pace. I love Robert Thorogood’s writing’&lt;br /&gt;Peter James&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘This second DEATH IN PARADISE NOVEL is a gem’&lt;br /&gt;DAILY EXPRESS&lt;br /&gt;‘Deftly entertaining … satisfyingly pushes all the requisite Agatha Christie-style buttons’&lt;br /&gt;Barry Forshaw, THE INDEPENDENT&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘For fans of Agatha Christie’&lt;br /&gt;MAIL ON SUNDAY&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘A treat.’&lt;br /&gt;RADIO TIMES&lt;br /&gt;‘This brilliantly crafted, hugely enjoyable and suitably goosebump-inducing novel is an utter delight from start to finish’&lt;br /&gt;HEAT&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘Plenty of red herrings and twists to keep readers guessing’ DAILY EXPRESS&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&#39;Fans will enjoy returning to DI Richard Poole… just switch off and relax&#39;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE READING&lt;/p&gt;
