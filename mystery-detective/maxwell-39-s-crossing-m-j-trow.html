Paul&amp;amp;#8217;s counterpart is Hector Gold, who is accompanied to Leighford by his eccentric family including his wife Camille and her parents, Jeff and Alana O&amp;amp;#8217;Malley.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Clearly Jeff O&amp;amp;#8217;Malley is quite a character &amp;amp;#150; with money to burn he has been gate-crashing the local poker school, much to the dismay of its members.
