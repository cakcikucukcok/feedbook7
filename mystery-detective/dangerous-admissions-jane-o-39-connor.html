  <title>Dangerous Admissions - Jane O&#39;Connor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Miranda &quot;Rannie&quot; Bookman&amp;#8212;43, divorced mother of two, with a recent love life consisting of a long string of embarrassingly brief encounters&amp;#8212;is beginning to feel like a dangling participle: connected to nothing. Her career as a copyeditor is down the toilet (she makes one little slip&amp;#8212;a missing &quot;l&quot; from the last word in the title of the Nancy Drew classic &lt;em&gt;The Secret of the Old Clock&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;and suddenly she&#39;s Publishing Enemy #1!), so she&#39;s been forced to take any gig she can get. And that means giving tours at the Chapel School, the ultra-exclusive, ultra-expensive, private academy that her children attend. Certainly not the most interesting of employments . . . at least until someone stumbles across the dead body of the Director of College Admissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigating a murder was never in her job description, but with her soon-to-be-college-bound boy Nate  a prime suspect, Rannie has little choice. Besides, who better to dot all the &quot;i&quot;s and cross all the &quot;t&quot;s  than a self-proclaimed &quot;language cop&quot;? Her diligence might even lead her to a brand-new love. Or to a killer. Or to another corpse&amp;#8212;hopefully not her own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
