  <title>Pattern of Shadows - Judith Barrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mary is a nursing sister at a Lancashire prison camp for the housing and treatment of German POWs. Life at work is difficult but fulfilling; life at home a constant round of arguments &quot;?? often prompted by her fly-by-night sister, Ellen, the apple of her shorttempered father&#39;s eye. Then Frank turns up at the house one night &quot;?? a guard at the camp, he&#39;s been watching Mary for weeks &quot;?? and won&#39;t leave until she agrees to walk out with him. Frank Shuttleworth is a difficult man to love and it&#39;s not long before Mary gives him his marching orders. But Shuttleworth won&#39;t take no for an answer and the gossips are eager for their next victim, for the least hint at fraternization with the enemy. Now, not only Mary&#39;s happiness but her very life is threatened by the most dangerous of wartime secrets...Mary is a nursing sister at a Lancashire prison camp for the housing and treatment of German POWs.
