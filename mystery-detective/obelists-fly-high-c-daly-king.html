  <title>Obelists Fly High - C. Daly King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A very thrilling story &amp;#8230; [with] a real surprise midway in the book, and a double-barreled shock at the end &amp;#8230; the reader&#39;s interest is never allowed to flag.&quot; &amp;#8213; &lt;I&gt;The New York Times.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;Captain Michael Lord of the New York City Police is the target of desperate shots fired on board a twin-engine plane, where a premeditated murder has already taken place. Will the dashing detective survive the assault? Will anyone emerge alive from the now-plummeting aircraft? And who killed the famous surgeon that the captain was guarding?&lt;BR&gt;This ingeniously constructed novel begins with an epilogue, concludes with a prologue, and offers a &quot;Clue Finder&quot; that reveals&amp;nbsp;forty hints even the sharpest armchair detective may have missed. Originally published in 1935, this long-unavailable thriller dates from the Golden Age of detective fiction, when mysteries were judged by the cleverness of their crimes and the resourcefulness of their sleuths. The twisting plot, impossible murder, &quot;locked-room&quot; setting, and remarkable surprises elevate &lt;I&gt;Obelists Fly High&lt;/I&gt; to the level of the best of Ellery Queen and Agatha Christie." />
