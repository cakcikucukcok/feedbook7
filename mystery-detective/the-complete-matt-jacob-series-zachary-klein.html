  <title>The Complete Matt Jacob Series - Zachary Klein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;The acclaimed Matt Jacob series by Zachary Klein - now together in an ebook box set for the first time ever.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This box set includes all four books in the Matt Jacob series, including:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;STILL AMONG THE LIVING&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In this New York Times Notable Book, Boston P.I. Matt Jacob has a cloudy past and a P.I. license gathering dust. And what begins as two simple favors soon turns into a fight for his life when the unrelated cases combine to snare Matt into a web of adultery, betrayal, and murder.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;TWO WAY TOLL&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When a ragged figure from his past shows up, Matt winds up back in the Combat Zone--but this time, his chances of getting out again are much slimmer. Now Matt faces demons from his past as well as a psychopath bent on killing him when he investigates two ominously similar deaths occurring twenty years apart.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;NO SAVING GRACE&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the midst of a holy celebration, a powerful and beloved rabbi is gunned down by the ringleader of a white supremacist hate group -- who in turn is shot dead by another rabbi. To help attorney and friend Simon Roth defend the volatile Rabbi Yonah Saperstein, Matt agrees to ferret out the first-hand facts in the double slaying.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;TIES THAT BLIND&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Matt looks to uncover the truth behind a friend&#39;s attempted suicide, he finds that everything he has worked so hard for could end in an instant: his sobriety, his relationships with loved ones, even his own life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
