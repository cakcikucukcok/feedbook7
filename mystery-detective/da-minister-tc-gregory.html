      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Maurice Washington, also known as Re-C, has already transformed his life from a young street hustler to head of an outreach program when he is snatched off the street by three men in an SUV. A short time later he is forced to kneel in front of a secret council and told he has been chosen to fulfill a specific task. Now he must abide by their guidelines or die. After he endures a grueling three-day initiation with other reluctant brothers, Maurice soon learns the meaning of Messenger 13that it is his job to interact with individuals facing their final walk and maybe somehow influence their fate. As he is propelled into his new role, Maurice finds himself in the midst of two former associates who are now lords of the city, a turf war instigated by the moving power of the universe, and an incident that causes havoc between the citizens and the local police department.&lt;/p&gt;" />
