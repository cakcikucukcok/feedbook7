  <title>Blood Reins - Michael Joens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Working with her beloved quarter stallion Buster Brown at a horse show competition, Detective Sandra Cameron begins to recover from the shooting that took her partner&#39;s life, and nearly her own. Her hard-won peace of mind, however, is shattered by the death of Chet Gundry, a world-renowned &quot;horse whisperer,&quot; ladies&#39; man, diabetic, and dear friend. Chet was a superstar in the equestrian universe, until someone spiked his insulin vial and reined him in, permanently. When Sandy discovers that her colleague Burbank detective Tom Rigby considers her a prime suspect in Chet&#39;s murder, her emotional and spiritual recovery is shaken to the core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second murder of an equestrian insider forces Sandy back on track. Putting aside their now shaky relationship, Sandy and Tom must pool their resources in order to stop a killer who will kill again, and again, to cover up a federal crime that would blow the lid off the equestrian industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set against a dazzling Southern California milieu of high-dollar quarter horse shows, world-class stallions, and breeders with enormous egos, &lt;i&gt;Blood Reins&lt;/i&gt; is a fast-paced police procedural that explores a deadly arena where the crowning of champions can provoke murderous consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Joens successfully mines the world of California horse breeding.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
