  <title>More Cases of a Private Eye: Classic Crime Stories - Ernest Dudley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This second book of Ernest Dudley&#39;s stories about his London-based private eye, Nat Craig, and his lovely French secretary, Simone, features a varied collection of the detective&#39;s eccentric clients: young, wealthy women getting themselves blackmailed; upper-class men or women who have the jitters over the safety of their precious family heirlooms; and, occasionally, even members of the criminal class, appealing to their former nemesis for help in clearing their names of false accusations. And not infrequently, Craig finds himself confronted with grisly murders, testing both his tough resourcefulness and his considerable powers of deduction. Here are fourteen classic British crime stories displaying an intriguing psychological slant on characters from every walk of life! Great entertainment, great reading!" />
