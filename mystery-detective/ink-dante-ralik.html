  <title>Ink - Dante Ralik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ebony, Ebony.  Are you ok?  I heard you scream.  Ebony slowly begins to stir.  Her mother stands over her with a concerned look on her face.  Ebony sits up and rubs the lengthy scar on her right forearm. 
What a dream.  I havent dreamt of how I got this scar in years.  Ebony groggily looks at her mother.  Did I scream out loud?  She embarrassingly inquires in that husky morning voice people have when just waking up.  Mildred starts toward her daughters closet.
No dear, you didnt.  Now please, pull yourself together.  We do have a funeral to attend.  Ebonys mother searches through her closet.  She keeps a firm grip on her emotions during times like this but she couldnt help a tear streaming down her face as she pulls her daughters black satin dress out of the closet.  Mildred wipes the tear off her cheek before turning to face her daughter.  Here, you can wear this.  Ill just put it over on the chair.  She retrieves Ebonys black two inch heel shoes from under the bed.  They are the appropriate kind.  She places the shoes in front of the chair.  I know this is a trying time for you.  Mildred says as she sits at the foot of the bed.  I just want you to know that your father and I are here for you; no matter what.   Ebony begins to tear.  Mildred moves closer to her daughter and comforts her.  Its ok, baby.   Go ahead, let it out. She says as Ebony sobs even harder.  I wish I could take all your pain away. 
Just then, a small black bird perches outside of the window.  With no sunshine in sight, its shadow slowly creeps into the cozy little room." />
