  <title>The Coal Black Asphalt Tomb - David Handler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The historic New England village of Dorset has actually elected a living, breathing &lt;i&gt;woman&lt;/i&gt; as its First Selectman. And now she&#39;s about to undertake the Historic District&#39;s biggest public works project in a generation-the widening and re-grading of Dorset Street. The job has needed doing for ages but the  previous First Selectman, Bob Paffin, always opposed it. So did a lot of Dorset&#39;s blue-blooded old guard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long put-off dig uncovers a body buried underneath the pavement in front of the Congregational Church. It belongs to Lt. Lance Paffin, Bob Paffin&#39;s older brother, a dashing U.S. Navy flyer who went missing off his sailboat the night of the country club&#39;s spring dance more than forty years ago. Everyone had assumed he just left town. But now it&#39;s clear Lance has been under Dorset Street this whole time, and that he was murdered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Des and Mitch soon discover that there are deep, dark secrets surrounding Dorset&#39;s elite, and some very distinguished careers have been built on lies. &lt;i&gt;The Coal Black Asphalt Tomb&lt;/i&gt; is the tenth in David Handler&#39;s original and very funny Berger and Mitry mystery series featuring this engaging biracial couple.&lt;/p&gt;" />
