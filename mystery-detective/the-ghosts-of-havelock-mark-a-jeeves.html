  <title>The Ghosts of Havelock - Mark A. Jeeves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Inspector Hartnell and Sergeant Johnson are called out to investigate a routine break-in at the home of a prominent but aging mathematician, Frederick Leston. Strangely, it would appear the burglars took nothing of valuejust a simple folder. Even Leston cant understand why one folder would be of such interest to criminalsor so he claims.
Hartnell and Johnson arent convinced and believe the old man might be hiding something, but they have no idea theyre about to jump head-first into a mysterious situation that could get them both killed. They soon find themselves racing around Great Britain and France, trying to make sense of a bizarre set of circumstances, all seemingly related to Leston.
During their investigation, the policemen have a feeling theyre being followed, and they also suspect Leston has lied to them. There must be something to the odd burglary and not just a botched attempt for petty thieves to get rich. When murder ups the stakes, this case turns deadly but goes to prove that no one can escape the past." />
