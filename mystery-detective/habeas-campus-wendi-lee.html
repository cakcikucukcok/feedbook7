  <title>Habeas Campus - Wendi Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Angela Matelli grew up in a large Italian family in East Boston, leaving only to join the U. S. Marine Corps. Now working as a private investigator, Angela&#39;s usual case involves the streets and scenes she has known since childhood. And her caseload has included some of the toughest around - kidnappers, terrorists, murders, and her mother. But now she&#39;s been called upon to take on a new case up in the usually bucolic countryside of Vermont on the campus of Hartmore College and it may finally be the one that is too much for her skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her client at the well-regarded school is a professor of anthropology specializing in the study of Haiti and voodoo. Less than a week ago, one of his students died suddenly of no cause and, after that, he is sure that he saw her walking near campus. Since then, he&#39;s received two crude voodoo warnings on his life. Now Angela has to protect her client while tracking down the truth about the student&#39;s death, and possible reanimation, in this fifth exciting installment of Wendi Lee&#39;s compelling Angela Matelli Mystery series, &lt;i&gt;Habeas Campus&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
