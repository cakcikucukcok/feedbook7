  <title>Sweet Poison - Ellen Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ellen Hart was named the 2017 MWA Grand Master, the most distinguished lifetime achievement award offered in the mystery community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jane Lawless is at her wit&#39;s end keeping her Minneapolis restaurants running while volunteering on her father&#39;s campaign for governor. With an eleven-point lead, the race is Ray Lawless&#39;s to lose, but all that changes when his rival posts a list of violent criminals that are back on the streets early, thanks to Ray&#39;s work during his career as a defense lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corey Hodge is one of the convicts that took Ray&#39;s advice to plead guilty for a crime that he swears he didn&#39;t commit. Bitter from time served, revenge lurks in the back of his mind. Then one of Ray&#39;s young campaign volunteers is killed, and with the murder mirroring the crime Corey was convicted of, Jane has to bring the killer to justice to save her father&#39;s political career and to keep Corey from going to prison again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high stakes and political intrigue that fuel &lt;i&gt;Sweet Poison&lt;/i&gt;, the latest in Lambda and Minnesota Book Award--winning author, and MWA Grand Master Ellen Hart&#39;s absorbing Jane Lawless series, make for an intense mystery of ambition and obsession.&lt;/p&gt;" />
