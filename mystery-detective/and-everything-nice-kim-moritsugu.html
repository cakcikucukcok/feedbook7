Her life isn&#39;t in a rut exactly, but it&#39;s not headed where she&#39;d like it to be. At her mother&#39;s suggestion, she joins a community choir. Soon she&#39;s singing rock songs in four-part harmony and has met a completely new group of people, including Anna Rai, a local TV personality. When Anna&#39;s private journal goes missing, she confides in Stephanie that she feels terribly vulnerable. What if the notebook falls into the wrong hands and her secrets are made public? She hints that such revelations could be devastating to her and other public figures. When a blackmailer demands cash in exchange for the notebook, the two women lay a trap to snare the crook.
