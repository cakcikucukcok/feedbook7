  <title>No Place Like Home - Anne R. Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Comedy with a conscience. A laugh-out-loud mashup of romantic comedy, crime fiction, and satire: Dorothy Parker meets Dorothy L. Sayers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perennially down-and-out socialite Camilla Randall a.k.a. &amp;quot;The Manners Doctor&amp;quot; is a magnet for murder, mayhem and Mr. Wrong, but she always solves the mystery in her quirky, but oh-so-polite way. Usually with more than a little help from her gay best friend, Plantagenet Smith.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Doria Windsor, the uber-rich editor of Home decorating magazine loses everything, including her Ponzi-schemer husband, when their luxury wine-country home mysteriously goes up in flames. Homeless, destitute, presumed dead and branded a criminal, 59-yr-old Doria has a crash course in reality&amp;hellip;and a second chance at love.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Meanwhile, reluctant sleuth Camilla Randall is facing homelessness too, as Doria&amp;#39;s husband&amp;#39;s schemes unravel and take down innocent bystanders along the way. When the mysterious&amp;mdash;and dangerously attractive&amp;mdash;Mr. X. turns up at Camilla&amp;#39;s bookstore looking for clues to the death of a missing homeless man, Camilla joins in the search.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With the help of brave trio of homeless people and a little dog named Toto, Doria, Camilla and Mr. X journey to unmask the real killer and reveal the dark secrets of Doria&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;financial wizard&amp;quot; husband.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anne. R. Allen weaves her usual blend of archetypal images (this time from The Wizard of Oz) with unique and wacky characters, hilarious situations, and laugh-out-loud one-liners that all somehow come together and make perfect sense at the end.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No Place Like Home is the fourth of the Camilla Randall Mysteries, but can be read as a stand-alone novel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Snarky, quirky, and hilarious!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A warp-speed, lighthearted comedy mystery, No Place Like Home offers lasting laughs beneath which a message resounds &amp;ndash; Being homeless is scary&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t miss this wild and wacky ride from the gorgeous Morro Bay and the Edna Valley wineries to the Big Sur coastline. It&amp;#39;s a real hoot!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Allen&amp;#39;s genius comes through as she opens a window on the world of the homeless showing the reader a sensitivity toward these people who have lost everything, often through no fault of their own.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;" />
