  <title>Five Monkeys - Kieran Galvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NADIA WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO BE THE MAN SHE WAS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nadia Spencer is America&amp;rsquo;s favorite bi-racial cosmetic surgeon. She&amp;rsquo;s the UN Special Ambassador for Female Genital Mutilation, a mother to two wise-ass kids, and she&amp;rsquo;s married to the Republican candidate for Mayor of New York. She&amp;rsquo;s just launched her new book. He&amp;rsquo;s four weeks away from election day. The only problem is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Nadia wasn&amp;rsquo;t always a woman. And right now Nadia wants to be a man, again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the truth comes out, not even Kim Kardashian&amp;rsquo;s big fat ass is gonna knock Nadia Spencer off the front pages. Even if they stick candles in it and set her on fire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
5 stars ***** Smart, funny and suspenseful!&lt;br /&gt;
5 stars ***** Political spin doctoring spun out of control&lt;br /&gt;
5 stars ***** A must read book. It takes you where you least expect to go.&lt;br /&gt;
5 stars ***** A fantastic read, something fresh and daringly different.&lt;br /&gt;
5 stars ***** A brilliant read from start to finish&lt;br /&gt;
5 stars ***** A True Page-Turner&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;If you like suspense, political intrigue, comedy, and satire, or if dark humor is your thing, this witty novel will keep you laughing and guessing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Set in contemporary New York, Five Monkeys is a funny book for adults, filled with observations and situations that will make you think twice and maybe challenge some of your ideas about gender, sexuality and modern families. It&amp;#39;s a caustic satire on American politics, campaigning, disinformation, media manipulation and outright lying - filled with the blackest humor and the kind of moral ambiguity that has poisoned American democracy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;FROM THE AUTHOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you buy this book, what can you expect? A great story with fascinating characters, and lots of twists and turns. It&amp;#39;s a fast read with sharp dialogue and satire - finding humor and empathy in situations with dysfunctional families, gay and transgender characters, drag queens, ambitious politicians, and TV chat show hosts. I promise it will be some of the highest quality writing you&amp;#39;ll find online. I want to hear you LAUGHING and make you CARE for all the characters - even when they do some things that might shock you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Careful, there are a few sexy scenes that might get your heart racing but they&amp;#39;ll really help you get inside the characters&amp;#39; heads.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is not a short book. At 75,000 words it&amp;#39;s around 320 pages, but it&amp;#39;s a fast read because the action keeps moving and the dialogue is sharp.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;By the time you get to the happy but perverse ending I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ll be very satisfied.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;So, I hope you take this journey with me. I wrote this for readers like me - informed, global citizens, who love satire, irony, dark humor and clever comedy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
