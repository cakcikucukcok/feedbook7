  <title>The Daughter - Jane Shemilt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the tradition of Gillian Flynn, Tana French, and Ruth Rendell, this compelling and clever psychological thriller spins the harrowing tale of a mother&amp;#8217;s obsessive search for her missing daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenny is a successful family doctor, the mother of three great teenagers, married to a celebrated neurosurgeon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when her youngest child, fifteen-year-old Naomi, doesn&amp;#8217;t come home after her school play, Jenny&amp;#8217;s seemingly ideal life begins to crumble. The authorities launch a nationwide search with no success. Naomi has vanished, and her family is broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the months pass, the worst-case scenarios&amp;#8212;kidnapping, murder&amp;#8212;seem less plausible. The trail has gone cold. Yet for a desperate Jenny, the search has barely begun. More than a year after her daughter&amp;#8217;s disappearance, she&amp;#8217;s still digging for answers&amp;#8212;and what she finds disturbs her. Everyone she&amp;#8217;s trusted, everyone she thought she knew, has been keeping secrets, especially Naomi. Piecing together the traces her daughter left behind, Jenny discovers a very different Naomi from the girl she thought she&amp;#8217;d raised.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
