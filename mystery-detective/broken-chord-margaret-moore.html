  <title>Broken Chord - Margaret Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;Feels like a grown up, intense and grisly version of Cluedo, you suspect everyone and trust no one. Jacopo is from a family of aristocrats, he is known as the Dragon, rescues kittens and lives in a wing of the family Palazzo in Florence. When Jaco walks through Lucca or drives home, it feels as though you are seeing Italy through the eyes of a local. The legal, social and cultural aspect of this novel is as intriguing as the identity of the killer. As the gripping story continues, you may start to have your suspicions, but this in no way spoils the ending, as there are still a number of surprises waiting to trip you up along the way. It s good to know that this is the first in the &#39;Jacopo Dragonetti&#39; mystery series, may there be many more to come.&#39; --Liz Loves Books&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;BROKEN CHORD, an elegant psychological exploration of a dysfunctional family in a fine tradition of crime mystery is a great read, and I will follow Drago s investigations and musings in further instalments.&#39; --Euro Crime&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margaret Moore has created a stylish, astute yet empathetic Italian investigator. State Prosecutor Jacopo Dragonetti known as Drago (the dragon), makes his debut in this elegant psychological exploration of a dysfunctional family. Ursula von Bachmann made many bad decisions in her life, but the worst was to let her killer into her bedroom. In the unbearable heat of July in Tuscany, investigating magistrate Jacopo Dragonetti unravels a family history of feuds and violence. Money can buy you many things but it can&amp;amp;#8217;t protect you from murder, it can&amp;amp;#8217;t buy you love, and there is no love lost in the despotic Ursula s family. Imprisoned in the villa, they eye each other with increasing suspicion and fear. Three children by three different fathers, resentful servants, a jilted lover, and echoes from the Second World War as well as the more recent past, are the components of this complex case.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
