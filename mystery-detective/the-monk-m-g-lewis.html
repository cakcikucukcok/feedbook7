  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The Monk - M. G. Lewis</i></b> | The Monk is one of many Gothic novels that criticises the Catholic Church and Catholic tradition. Lewis's condemnation of the Church is apparent throughout the novel in his characterisation of Catholic clergy members, as well as his treatment of Catholic superstition.<br /><b><i>The Monk - Wikipedia</i></b> | However as a fan of literature, The Monk is an essential read for a good grounding in all the literature offerings coming out of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Lewis was young when he wrote it, and for the controversy it did and still cause it must be considered a classic and a masterpiece in its own right.<br /><b><i>The monk: Lewis, M.
