  <title>Terror in Taffeta - Marla Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wedding  planner Kelsey McKenna is just a few hours away from wrapping up her  latest job: a destination wedding in the charming, colonial Mexican town  of San Miguel de Allende. The reception is all set up, the tequila  donkey is waiting outside, and the bride and groom are standing on the  altar, pledging their eternal love. But just as the priest is about to  pronounce them husband and wife, one of the bridesmaids upstages the  couple by collapsing into a floral arrangement.  Worst of all, Kelsey  discovers that she hasn&#39;t just fainted-she&#39;s dead. The demanding mother  of the bride, Mrs. Abernathy, insists Kelsey not tell the wedding party;  she paid for a wedding after all, not a funeral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing a  bridesmaid is bad enough, but when the bride&#39;s sister is arrested for  murder, Mrs. Abernathy demands that Kelsey fix the matter at once. And  although she&#39;s pretty sure investigating a murder isn&#39;t in her contract,  crossing the well-connected mother of the bride could be a  career-killer. Before she can leave Mexico and get back to planning  weddings, Kelsey must deal with stubborn detectives, another dead body,  and a rekindled romance in this smart, funny cozy debut perfect for fans  of Carolyn Haines.&lt;/p&gt;" />
