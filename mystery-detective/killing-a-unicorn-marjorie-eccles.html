  <title>Killing a Unicorn - Marjorie Eccles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A family with secrets---is murder one of them? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Membery Place has been the home of the Calvert family for over one hundred years. Below it, set in a forest clearing, is a modern, award-winning house designed by architect Mark Calvert, one of Alyssa Calvert&#39;s three sons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark&#39;s wife, Francesca, has been conscious of an intriguing element of mystery surrounding Bianca Morgan ever since Chip, the eldest Calvert brother, brought her and her child to live with him at Membery. No one, except possibly Chip, knows anything about her previous life. Bianca remains an enigma---and then one day her body is found in a pool beneath a waterfall on the estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three brothers have always been very close, but the subsequent inquiry now reveals that they all had their own secret connection with Bianca. Could one of them have had reason to kill her? Perhaps Jonathan, to save his career as an international cello soloist; Mark, to save his marriage---or even Chip?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus of the inquiry shifts dramatically when Bianca&#39;s nine-year-old son goes missing. Has the child too been killed, or has he been abducted because he saw his mother&#39;s murder? The fruitless search for Bianca&#39;s killer and the kidnapper forces Francesca to take matters into her own hands, determined to resolve the mystery of the Calvert family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
