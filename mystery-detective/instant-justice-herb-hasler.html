  <title>Instant Justice - Herb Hasler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When detective Ed Cowley moved from his small
mid-western town to Chicago and joined the 
metropolitan police force, he wondered if he had bitten
off more than he could chew.
&lt;p&gt;Initially unable to land a job as detective, he took the 
position of beat-cop and was paired up with an aging, 
hard-nosed veteran.  On the rundown streets 
of the lower west side of Chicago, he  learned quickly 
that enforcing the law can be a harsh 
and sometimes violent endeavor.
&lt;p&gt;After his partner was injured on the job, he was promoted 
back to detective, where he struggled to find a balance 
between the brutal and sometimes out-of-control 
methods used on the streets, and the slow and often 
frustrating procedures of detective work." />
