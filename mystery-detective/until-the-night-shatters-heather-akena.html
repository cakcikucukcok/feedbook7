  <title>Until the Night Shatters - Heather Akena</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;What are you waiting for, I said kill her!&quot; he screamed as loud as he could. It sounded like a knife in Amelia&#39;s ears, and she tried to look over at him, but he was already gone. Gone to take everything else from her. He had been right . . . she should have killed him while he wasn&#39;t a threat, but it was that very fact that made her unable to kill him in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SS-Oberschtze Markus Lubrich warned me this would happen. He said I didn&#39;t know when to quit, but the truth is, I just don&#39;t know how. I&#39;ve been living a lie for years, a traitor in the midst of a thousand nationalists. But until the the iron hand that controls our destiny is no longer a threat, I can never stop searching for a way to make sure we survive. But when it&#39;s over and the Reich has fallen, we will finally be able to live without fear of what is lurking in the shadows. Victorious over our enemies. Over our past. Over our future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forever. &lt;/p&gt;" />
