  <title>This Old Souse - Mary Daheim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling mystery maven Mary Daheim brings us another intriguing tale in her cherished Bed-and-Breakfast mystery series in which a trip down memory lane brings Judith and Renie back to their old neighbourhood, and they are drawn to a seemingly deserted house that is much more than meets the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a trip to Renie&#39;s old neighbourhood, the cousins&#39; curiosity is piqued by a mysterious brick Tudor house that always looked deserted during Renie&#39;s junior high school days. Surprised that the house still looks abandoned after all these years, Judith and Renie, of course, cannot resist an opportunity to snoop around. They discover that Mr. and Mrs. Bland have lived in the house since 1947, and after cornering the mailman and milkman, Judith and Renie also learn that the Blands receive regular mail and food deliveries, but no one has ever seen the occupants who simply pay the bills with cash they leave in the milk box. Although intrigued by these strange, but definitely not sinister, occurrences, Judith is ready to focus her attention once more on her neglected husband Joe and the busy B&amp;#38;B business. Until one day Judith finds a dead body in the trunk of her car. And it&#39;s the Blands&#39; milkman...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
