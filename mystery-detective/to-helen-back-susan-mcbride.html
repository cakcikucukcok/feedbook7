  <title>To Helen Back - Susan Mcbride</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this fun and sassy new mystery, &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Susan McBride introduces us to Helen Evans, a modern-day Miss Marple who must expose a murderer in a town full of suspects!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Milton Grone turns up dead in tiny River Bend, Illinois, nearly all the would-be suspects have the perfect alibi: attending Thursday night&#39;s town meeting. And as Milton was hardly beloved, plenty of folks had a reason to do him in ... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grone&#39;s next-door neighbor was furious about a fence that encroached on her property, among other wicked deeds. A pair of zealous tree huggers wanted Grone&#39;s hide for selling a parcel of pristine land to a water park. Grone&#39;s current and ex-wife both wanted a cut of the profits, which Grone seemed unwilling to share. Even the town preacher knew Grone&#39;s soul was beyond saving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though most of River Bend would rather reward the killer than hang him, Sheriff Biddle&#39;s not about to let this one go &amp;#8230; and neither is Helen Evans. With a penchant for puzzles and an ear for innuendo, Helen quickly fingers the culprit before Biddle puts the wrong suspect in jail.&lt;/p&gt;" />
