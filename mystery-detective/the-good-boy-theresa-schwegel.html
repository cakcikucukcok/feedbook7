  <title>The Good Boy - Theresa Schwegel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Edgar award winner Theresa Schwegel returns with &lt;i&gt;The Good Boy&lt;/i&gt;, her most dramatic and emotional novel to date, a family epic that combines the hard-boiled grit of her acclaimed police thrillers with an intimate portrait of a young boy trying to follow his heart in an often heartless city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Officer Pete Murphy, K9 duty is as much a punishment as a promotion. When a shaky arrest reignites a recent scandal and triggers a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, all eyes are on Pete as the department braces for another media firestorm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Pete&#39;s eleven-year-old son Joel feels invisible. His parents hardly notice him--unless they&#39;re arguing about his &quot;behavioral problems&quot;--and his older sister, McKenna, has lately disappeared into the strange and frightening world of teenagerdom. About the only friend Joel has left is Butchie, his father&#39;s furry &quot;partner.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Joel and Butchie follow McKenna to a neighborhood bully&#39;s party, illegal activity kicks the dog&#39;s police training into overdrive, and soon the duo are on the run, navigating the streets of Chicago as they try to stay one step ahead of the bad guys--bad guys who may have a very personal interest in getting some payback on Officer Pete Murphy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
