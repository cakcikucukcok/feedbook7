&amp;quot;Rachel Amphlett is a master of misdirection!&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; Goodreads&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s what you get in the box set:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Hell to Pay&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When a road traffic accident on a dark autumn night uncovers a disturbing conspiracy, Detective Sergeant Kay Hunter&amp;rsquo;s investigation exposes a ruthless serial killer exploiting vulnerable young women.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With her enemies unmasked and her career spiralling out of control, Kay&amp;rsquo;s determination to seek vengeance for the victims brings her dangerously close to those who want to silence her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Undeterred, she uncovers the real reason behind a plot to destroy her career and sets in motion a terrifying chain of events.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Could Kay&amp;rsquo;s need for revenge be her undoing, or will she survive to see justice served?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Hell to Pay&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping fast paced crime thriller, and the fourth in the Detective Kay Hunter series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Call to Arms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Loyalty has a price.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kay Hunter has survived a vicious attack at the hands of one of the country&amp;#39;s most evil serial killers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Returning to work after an enforced absence to recover, she discovers she wasn&amp;#39;t the only victim of that investigation. DI Devon Sharp remains suspended from duties, and the team is in turmoil.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Determined to prove herself once more and clear his name, Kay undertakes to solve a cold case that links Sharp to his accuser.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;But, as she gets closer to the truth, she realises her enquiries could do more harm than good.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Torn between protecting her mentor and finding out the truth, the consequences of Kay&amp;#39;s enquiries will reach far beyond her new role&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Call to Arms&lt;/i&gt; is a fast-paced murder mystery, and the fifth in the Detective Kay Hunter series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Gone to Ground&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While attending a crime scene on the outskirts of Maidstone, DI Kay Hunter makes a shocking discovery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The victim has been brutally cut to pieces, his identity unknown.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When more body parts start turning up in the Kentish countryside, Kay realises the disturbing truth &amp;ndash; a serial killer is at large and must be stopped at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With no motive for the murders and a killer who has gone undetected until now, Kay and her team of detectives must work fast to calm a terrified local population and a scornful media.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When a third victim is found, her investigation grows even more complicated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As she begins to expose a dark underbelly to the county town, Kay and her team are pulled into a web of jealousy and intrigue that, if left unchecked, will soon claim another life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Gone to Ground&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping serial killer thriller full of page-turning suspense, and the sixth book in the Detective Kay Hunter series to date:&lt;br /&gt;
