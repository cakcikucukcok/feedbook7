  <title>I John - Thomas Warner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;My name is John Dunne, first son of Alison Dunne, the first person to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;cross in our family. In fact the only person to cross in our family, that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;is until I, John crossed over to the other side of this world and what a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;world it is, this other side. Terrifying? Yes sometimes. Beautiful . . . yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;sometimes. Beautiful terrifying and exhilarating and deadly all at the same&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;time? Yes. Yes. Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;We in this family are only a few of the many thousands that can cross&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;over. Some of us however have that extra gift that allows us to go that one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;step further than most. I can and so can my half brother Michael Mac Coy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;He is in fact only four years old and can do almost anything he sets his&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;mind to. Of course being so young my mother Ali, his father Jason and I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;and our many friends have to keep a close eye on him at all times as he can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;disappear and reappear at will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be totally honest that kid is a right old pain in the ass, every time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;one turns around he is in your face. We fight evil wherever we find it even&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;it is within ourselves. I have met many a poor soul from this world and the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;other and I have stored their stories in a room somewhere at the back of my&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;mind. Most of the time they stay there and are very scary and off putting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;but every now and then like one or two of the funnier ones suddenly spring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;to mind. Just to show you that it is not always doom and gloom but life as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;you well know can be quite hilarious at times. I would like to pass one of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;these stories on to you if I may? You may or not be interested but I have got&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to tell them to someone and sure it might as well be you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
