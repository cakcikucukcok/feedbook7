      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Something very sinister is going on behind the scenes at Glasgow’s West End Festival parade in the compelling new Anderson and Costello mystery.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Paige Riley has been missing for a week. Not that anyone cares much about the homeless heroin addict. The case remains open but inactive; left standing still until something comes up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Meanwhile, Glasgow’s citizens are in celebratory mood for the annual West End Festival parade. But beneath the jovial surface lurks something darker. A confused young woman is found wandering among the clowns, stilt-walkers and jostling crowds, claiming to have been abducted by aliens. She had originally disappeared the night before. What happened to her in those intervening hours? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Before DCI Anderson and DI Costello can find out, a body is discovered. Is there a connection? As the two detectives investigate, it becomes horrifyingly clear that a depraved killer has taken advantage of the busiest day of the year to carry out a gruesomely macabre plan." />
