  <title>The Devil Speaks Louder: - Jeremy Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    The late teenage years are times to experiment, to flirt with chance-taking and laugh at near-misses. Jason and Brian are invincible, with miles to go
    before they sleep, and their good times are bacchanalian. This Friday afternoon is no exception: Jason, ignoring the fact that he is on the brink of
    failure, leaves school early again to begin the party. He and Brian drink into the afternoon; the warning of blue lights is not enough to end the hilarity,
    and as lucidity morphs to black-out, Brian must make a decision between carnal desire and adult responsibility. His sodden mind is in no condition to
    deliberate, and the night turns tragic. Having now to deal with the reality of prison, the loathing of a community, the screaming of his demons and the
    battle with his conscience, Brian is forced into very serious self-analysis, while Jason uses his best friends plight as a justification to continue his
    own insane drinking behavior which could, ultimately, lead to his need to find a bottom. Written by a recovering alcoholic, this fictitious story contains
    would-be scenarios relevant to all mature readers, for there are few degrees of separation between it, and you.
