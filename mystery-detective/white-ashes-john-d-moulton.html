  <title>White Ashes - John D. Moulton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rachael Farrington is sitting on a riverbank when young Jason Beauvale wanders into her life. The two become inseparable, but Rachaels mother is suspicious of the boy; hes wealthy and, for reasons of her own, she has no trust for him and his kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the couple become closer, Jason shares a secret: Many years earlier he witnessed his father escape, badly injured, under a hail of bullets. He doesnt know why it happened, or if his father survived, or why his mother then chose a life in hiding, refusing to speak much of him or their past lives again. These are mysteries that haunt the boy and which he aches to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ironic twist, as the young couple battle against those determined to end their passionate relationship, they are confronted by the very forces that lurked in Jasons past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the turmoil that follows, loved ones soon face abduction, imprisonment and death, as an unscrupulous organization, known as The Syndicate, seeks to fulfill a long-outstanding resolution to which Jason unwittingly becomes the key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight for justice falls to Rachael, but with high-ranking police corruption working to defeat her, how can she alone bring The Syndicate down?&lt;/p&gt;" />
