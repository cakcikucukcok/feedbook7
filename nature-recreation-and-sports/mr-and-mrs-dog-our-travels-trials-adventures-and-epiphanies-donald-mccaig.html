  <title>Mr. and Mrs. Dog: Our Travels, Trials, Adventures, and Epiphanies - Donald McCaig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling author Donald McCaig     has established an expansive literary career, founded equally on books about working sheepdogs     and the Civil War novels &lt;i&gt;Jacob&#39;s Ladder&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rhett     Butler&#39;s People,&lt;/i&gt; the official sequel to &lt;i&gt;Gone with the     Wind.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In his new book, &lt;i&gt;Mr. and Mrs. Dog,&lt;/i&gt; McCaig     draws on twenty-five years of experience raising sheepdogs to vividly describe his-and his dogs     June and Luke&#39;s-unlikely progress toward and participation in the World Sheepdog Trials in     Wales.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McCaig engagingly chronicles the often grueling experience-through     rain, snow, ice storms, and brain-numbing heat-of preparing and trialing Mrs. Dog, June, &quot;a     foxy lady in a slinky black-and-white peignoir,&quot; and Mr. Dog, Luke, &quot;a plain worker-no     flash to him.&quot; Along the way, he relays sage advice from his decades spent talking with     America&#39;s most renowned dog experts, from police-dog trainers to positive-training     gurus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As readers of McCaig&#39;s novels will expect, &lt;i&gt;Mr. and Mrs.     Dog&lt;/i&gt; delivers far more than straightforward dog-training tips. Revealing an abiding     love and respect for his dogs, McCaig unveils the life experiences that set him on the long road     to the Welsh trial fields. Starting with memories of his first dog, Rascal, and their Montana     roadtrip in a &#39;48 Dodge, McCaig leads us into his thirties, when he abandons his New York     advertising career to move to a run-down Appalachian sheep farm in the least populous county in     Virginia. This 1960s agrarian adventure ultimately brings McCaig, Luke, and June to the Olympics     of sheepdog trials. In his narration of one man&#39;s love for his dogs, McCaig offers a     powerful portrayal of the connection between humans and their animal     companions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
