  <title>Freehand Machine Embroidery - Maggie Kruger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I do not know how long ago embroidery started but I think through the centuries, women have turned to needlecraft and embroidery for pleasure. My Grandmother told us that in her days the young ladies did not work and was taught to do needlework and embroidery. Although times have changed and the love for embroidery still remains strong, women sadly neglects this art as they do not have time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sewing machine is a quicker medium for embroidery and decorative stitching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make a room look homely, cosy and beautiful with needlework and embroidery, it can be embroidered table cloths, runners, cushions, table mats, wall hangings, pictures, bed linen and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these things can become possible to you by taking each page step by step and practice the various stitches and methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those who are already experienced machinists, sewing machine embroidery will be much easier. Others may find it a little more difficult, but it can be overcome with a lot of practice and perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of machine embroidery needs a lot of practice, but, once having acquired control of the machine and embroidery hoop, there is no end to the possibilities of the work that can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that the sewing machine no longer will be regarded as the machine for sewing hems, mending, curtains and dressmaking, but be the means for enjoyment in producing beautiful, machine embroidery for the home and family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
