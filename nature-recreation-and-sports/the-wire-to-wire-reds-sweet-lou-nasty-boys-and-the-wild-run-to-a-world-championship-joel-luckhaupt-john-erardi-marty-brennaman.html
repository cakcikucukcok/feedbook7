  <title>The Wire-to-Wire Reds: Sweet Lou, Nasty Boys, and the Wild Run to a World Championship - Joel Luckhaupt, John Erardi, Marty Brennaman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;They were a one-year wonder, but what a year. The 1990 Cincinnati Reds stunned the baseball world by winning the National League pennant and then sweeping the heavily favored Oakland A&amp;#8217;s in the World Series. The Reds held first place from game one through the end of the world championships &amp;#151; becoming one of only three wire-to-wire champions in major league history. Surprisingly, the story of this colorful team has never been told before in a book. In conjunction with the 20th anniversary of this historic achievement, &lt;I&gt;The Wire-to-Wire Reds&lt;/I&gt; brings back the memories with original interviews, more than one hundred photos, and riveting storytelling by award-winning Cincinnati Enquirer columnist John Erardi and blog-master Joel Luckhaupt. With a foreword by Hall of Fame Reds announcer Marty Brennaman, &lt;I&gt;The Wire-to-Wire Reds&lt;/I&gt; is the ultimate keepsake for fans throughout Reds Country.&lt;/div&gt;" />
