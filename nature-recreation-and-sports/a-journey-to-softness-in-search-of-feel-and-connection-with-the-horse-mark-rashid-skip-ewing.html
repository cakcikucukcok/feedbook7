  <title>A Journey to Softness: In Search of Feel and Connection with the Horse - Mark Rashid, Skip Ewing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Internationally acclaimed horse trainer Mark Rashid shares and analyzes the remarkable events, quiet moments, and humbling stumbling blocks that&amp;#151;looking back&amp;#151;he can identify as significant in his personal journey to finding &amp;#147;softness&amp;#8221; with both horses and people. &amp;#147;Softness,&amp;#8221;  via what many in the horse world today might refer to as &amp;#147;feel,&amp;#8221; begins, Rashid says, with one simple truth: &amp;#147;It&amp;#8217;s not about what we do that starts us on the path to softness, but rather, it&amp;#8217;s what we don&amp;#8217;t do.&amp;#8221; Softness is having the sensitivity we need in order to feel when and if the horse tries to &amp;#147;give.&amp;#8221;It is about develping the kind of awareness and feel it takes to know when we are working against our horses, rather than with them. In these forthright  stories, readers get a glimpse of a life that has produced a man known for his ability to solve difficult problems with communication rather than force, as well as methods and techniques gleaned from decades of work with horses, horse people, and the &amp;#147;way of harmony&amp;#8221; through the martial arts.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
