  <title>Familiar Letters - The Writings of Henry David Thoreau - Henry David Thoreau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a collection of letters written by American naturalist Henry David Thoreau. Henry David Thoreau (1817 - 1862) was an American poet, philosopher, essayist, abolitionist, naturalist, development critic, and historian. He was also a leading figure in Transcendentalism, and is best known for his book &quot;Walden&quot;, a treatise on simple living in a natural environment. Other notable works by this author include: &quot;The Landlord&quot; (1843), &quot;Reform and the Reformers&quot; (1846-48), and &quot;Slavery in Massachusetts&quot; (1854). The letters in this volume are of a personal and intimate nature, and provide an unparalleled glimpse of both man and mind. &quot;Familiar Letters&quot; is highly recommended for fans of Thoreau&#39;s work, and it is not to be missed by the discerning collector. Contents include: &quot;Years Of Discipline&quot;, &quot;Golden Age Of Achievement&quot;, and &quot;Friends And Followers&quot;. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />
