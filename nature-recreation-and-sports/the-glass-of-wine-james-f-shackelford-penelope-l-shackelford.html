  <title>The Glass of Wine - James F. Shackelford, Penelope L. Shackelford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first book to focus on the role of glass as a material of critical importance to the wine industry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For centuries glass has been the material of choice for storing, shipping, and sipping wine. How did that come to pass, and why? To what extent have glassmaking and wine making co-evolved over the centuries? The first book to focus on the role of glass as a material of critical importance to the wine industry, &lt;i&gt;The Glass of Wine&lt;/i&gt; answers these and other fascinating questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors deftly interweave compelling historical, technical, and esthetic narratives in their exploration of glass as the vessel of choice for holding, storing, and consuming wine. They discuss the traditions informing the shapes and sizes of wine bottles and wine glasses, and they demystify the selection of the &quot;right glass&quot; for red versus white varietals, as well as sparkling and dessert wines. In addition, they review the technology of modern glassmaking and consider the various roles glass plays in wineries—especially in the enologist&#39;s laboratory. And they consider the increasing use of aluminum and polymer containers and its potential impact on the central role of glass as the essential material for wine appreciation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The first book focusing on the role of glass and its central importance to the wine industry&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Written by a glass scientist at UC Davis, home of the premier viticulture and enology program in North America&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Interlards discussions of the multi-billion-dollar glass and wine industries with valuable technical insights for scientists, engineers, and wine enthusiasts alike&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Illustrates the wide spectrum of bottles, carafes, decanters, and drinking glasses with an abundance of exquisite full-color photos&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both an authoritative guide and a compelling read, &lt;i&gt;The Glass of Wine &lt;/i&gt;tells the story of the centuries-old marriage between an endlessly fascinating material and a celebrated beverage. It is sure to have enormous appeal among ceramic and glass professionals, wine makers, and oenophiles of all backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
