  <title>More Notes from the Dockside - Mike Yurk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="More Notes From The Dockside is the second volume of columns Mike Yurk writes about fishing. These short gems from the world of the outdoors capture the fun, memories, adventures and occasional misadventures that come from days on the water. The stories are of people and in More Notes From the Dockside you will again meet The Commissioner, The Boat Doctor, and Mikes beloved wife, The Bass Queen, as well as the entire cast of Mikes fishing buddies. There are memories of fishing with his grandfather and father and now years later of fishing with his grandchildren. More Notes From The Dockside revels in the joys of time on the water and the simple pleasures of being in the outdoors with family and friends.     
In his previous collection of anecdotes, Notes From The Dockside, Mike Yurk puts the reader by the fire place at fishing camp or pot-bellied stove in a bait shop and spins the yarns that have fueled hours of conversation during and after many a fishing season. Anglers generally collect more stories than fish and Yurk provides a wealth of observations with More Notes From The Dockside, with journeys through the wonderful world of
Piscatorial pursuit.-Jon Echternacht, reporter Hudson (Wis.) 
Star Observer
Mike Yurk is a seasoned angler and author who has filled his stringer with stories on waters near and far. Pull up a seat and let him share his tales in Notes From The Dockside one pleasing nugget at a time.-Paul Smith, Outdoor Editor, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel" />
