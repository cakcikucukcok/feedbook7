  <title>Deep Water - Jacques Leslie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;If the wars of the last century were fought over oil, the wars of this century will be fought over water.&quot; -Ismail Serageldin, &lt;i&gt;The World Bank&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The giant dams of today are the modern Pyramids, colossally expensive edifices that generate monumental amounts of electricity, irrigated water, and environmental and social disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Deep Water&lt;/i&gt;, Jacques Leslie offers a searching account of the current crisis over dams and the world&#39;s water. An emerging master of long-form reportage, Leslie makes the crisis vivid through the stories of three distinctive figures: Medha Patkar, an Indian activist who opposes a dam that will displace thousands of people in western India; Thayer Scudder, an American anthropologist who studies the effects of giant dams on the peoples of southern Africa; and Don Blackmore, an Australian water manager who struggles to reverse the effects of drought so as to allow Australia to continue its march to California-like prosperity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking the reader to the sites of controversial dams, Leslie shows why dams are at once the hope of developing nations and a blight on their people and landscape. &lt;i&gt;Deep Water&lt;/i&gt; is an incisive, beautifully written, and deeply disquieting report on a conflict that threatens to divide the world in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
