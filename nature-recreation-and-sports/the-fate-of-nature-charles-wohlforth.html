  <title>The Fate of Nature - Charles Wohlforth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;What capacity for good lies in the hidden depths of people?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting with this question, award-winning author Charles Wohlforth sets forth on a wide-ranging exploration of our relationship with the world. In &lt;i&gt;The Fate of Nature&lt;/i&gt;, he draws on science, spirituality, history, economics, and personal stories to reveal answers about the future of that relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no better place to witness the highs and lows of our treatment of the natural world than the vast wilds, rocky coasts, and shifting settlements of Alaska.  Since the first encounter between Captain Cook&#39;s crew and the Alaskan Natives in 1778, there have been countless struggles between people who have had different plans for the region. Some have hoped to preserve Alaska as they found it, while others aimed to create something new in its place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidents such as the &lt;i&gt;Exxon Valdez&lt;/i&gt; oil spill may seem like cause for despair. In the face of such profound tragedies, Charles Wohlforth has found heartening developments in the science of human altruism. This new understanding of what causes humans to cooperate and act conscientiously may be the first step toward taking the actions necessary to preserve an environment that has already been altered drastically in our lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clear-eyed, original work of research, reportage, and philosophical reflections, &lt;i&gt;The Fate of Nature&lt;/i&gt; gives us a chance to change the way we think about our place in society and the world at large.&lt;/p&gt;" />
