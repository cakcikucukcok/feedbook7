  <title>Last Horizons - Peter Hathaway Capstick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peter Hathaway Capstick first earned a name as an outdoor writer in the pages of such magazines as &lt;i&gt;Guns &amp; Ammo&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Petersen&#39;s Hunting&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The American Hunter&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Outdoor Life&lt;/i&gt;. In &lt;i&gt;Last Horizons&lt;/i&gt;, the first of a two-volume collection of his hunting, fishing, and shooting tales, Capstick shares twenty-four stories of his keen eye and steady hand with rifle, shotgun, bow, and typewriter.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The critically acclaimed successor to Hemingway and Robert Ruark repeatedly put himself in harm&#39;s way to write about close scrapes with his trademark wit and dash. He tells what it&#39;s like to be in the path of an express train with Horns--the Cape buffalo; describes the heart-stopping sensation of sharing the immediate bush with several sickle-clawed lions that most certainly were prone to argue; and recounts his adventures bow-fishing for exotic species in the piranha-filled rivers of Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featuring finely rendered drawings by famous wildlife artist Dino Paravano, Capstick&#39;s experiences on five continents, painfully gained--and almost lost--with the most dangerous of game, are the yardsticks against which most modern exotic and hunting adventures are gauged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;No one since Hemingway (with the possible exception of Ruark) has written on these subjects with such literary gusto.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
