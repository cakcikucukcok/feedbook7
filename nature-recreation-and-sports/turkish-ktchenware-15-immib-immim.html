  <title>Turkish Ktchenware 15 - Immib Immim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At ????MM????B, we took pride in participating the international trade fair Ambiente, which&lt;br /&gt;
was held between 7 and 11 February 2014, for the 19th time together with 70&lt;br /&gt;
participants at Halls 3.0, 5.0 and 10.1. The Turkish national participants that showcased&lt;br /&gt;
a wide variety of high quality domestic products and souvenirs made of various&lt;br /&gt;
materials from metal to plastic and offered at competitive prices to attract visitors. 48&lt;br /&gt;
other Turkish companies that participated in the trade fair independently helped Turkey&lt;br /&gt;
rank among the top 10 countries in terms of number of participants at Ambiente. In&lt;br /&gt;
short, with the help of prosperous local companies, offering high quality and unique&lt;br /&gt;
designs, and through the aggressive promotional activities and events it held, Turkey&lt;br /&gt;
became the focus of the industry in the international arena at this year&amp;rsquo;s edition of the&lt;br /&gt;
trade fair which brought together 114 thousand suppliers from 161 countries. Well,&lt;br /&gt;
then what does this edition of our magazine, complementary copies of which we plan&lt;br /&gt;
to distribute at both the International Home and Housewares Show and the Hong&lt;br /&gt;
Kong Houseware fairs, feature? We made an interview to reflect the history of success&lt;br /&gt;
of Mehtap, a well-known brand name in both the Turkish and international markets,&lt;br /&gt;
holding a 1,8 share in the international market. Stating that 14 Mehtap-branded&lt;br /&gt;
products are sold every minute across the world, Mehtap Mutfak E????yalar???? Assistant&lt;br /&gt;
General Manager Sinan Paksoy sincerely answered our questions. This edition also&lt;br /&gt;
features interviews made with the executives of two other companies: &amp;Ccedil;etin Plastik,&lt;br /&gt;
and Aky????ld????z. We also made a short review of the making of earthenware pottery, a&lt;br /&gt;
traditional handicraft which is still popular in some of the regions in Anatolia. Thus, we&lt;br /&gt;
discovered that the Menemen Association of Earthenware Pottery Makers, formed in&lt;br /&gt;
Menemen/????zmir in 2013, has plans to launch a project, titled &amp;ldquo;Village of Earthenware&lt;br /&gt;
Pottery Makers&amp;rdquo;, in an effort to keep alive the handicraft which is on the brink of&lt;br /&gt;
extinction. We made a joyful interview with Can Yalman, an industrial designer who has&lt;br /&gt;
left his mark on many award-winning designs from yachts to culinary and from ceramic&lt;br /&gt;
to electronic products, at his office for you. Ali Ser&amp;ccedil;e, also known as &amp;ldquo;Ali Usta&amp;rdquo;, an awardwinning&lt;br /&gt;
cook, told Turkish Kitchenware about his professional history starting from&lt;br /&gt;
his childhood. This edition also features a short notice about the Packaging Design&lt;br /&gt;
Competition which will be organised jointly by ????KM????B and ????DDM????B for the first time this&lt;br /&gt;
year in the categories of Students and Professionals is open to both designers who&lt;br /&gt;
received design training individually or as a group.&lt;/p&gt;" />
