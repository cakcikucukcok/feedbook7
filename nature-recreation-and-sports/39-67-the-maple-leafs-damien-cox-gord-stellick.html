  <title>&#39;67: The Maple Leafs - Damien Cox, Gord Stellick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1967 the Toronto Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup in a stunning defeat of the mighty Montreal Canadiens. No other Leafs team has been able to do it again. As the years pass, the legend grows. The men who were the Leafs in 1967—a scrappy group of aging players and unsung youngsters—were the kings of the hockey universe. However, within five years of that victory things had changed drastically for many members of the team: two key members of the team, Tim Horton and Terry Sawchuk, were dead due to alcohol and drug-related issues, and Harold Ballard, the man who had succeeded Smythe as King of Carlton Street, was in jail.&lt;em&gt;Sixty-Seven&lt;/em&gt; is not just another hockey book about that legendary team; it is a unique and total look at the contradictions, the legends, the shame and the glory of &#39;67, telling previously untold stories from inside that unforgettable dressing room and far beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
