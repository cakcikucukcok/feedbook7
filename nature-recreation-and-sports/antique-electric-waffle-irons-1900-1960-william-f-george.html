  <title>Antique Electric Waffle Irons 1900-1960 - William F. George</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Finally. A comprehensive collector&#39;s book and historical reference containing everything there is to know about antique and vintage electric waffle irons and the companies that made them. The author, a former science teacher, precision scientific instrument maker, and writer, has for years collected, researched, restored, and in some cases written about everything from antique pocket watches and cameras to old radios and vintage automobiles. Bill&#39;s passion for antique electric appliances has led to this first-of-its-kind book. The author&#39;s collection of waffle makers, all meticulously restored to like-new condition, numbers in the hundreds. In this book he shares with the reader everything he&#39;s learned over the years about these little marvels and the companies and people that created them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This 258 page book is profusely illustrated with never-before-published materials about waffles and waffle irons including patent drawings, historic paintings, factory-issued literature, and vintage photos and advertisements. Also included are hundreds of informative photos of restored waffle irons from the author&#39;s personal collection along with rare and unusual examples from the collections of noted toaster and appliance aficionados from around the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is no ordinary collector-type picture book. It&#39;s the culmination of hundreds of hours of research into the history of the electric appliance industry in 20th century America. Through exclusive interviews with the heirs of company founders, with former employees, and with archivists, historians, and librarians, the author has been able to compile in-depth histories of over 85 appliance manufacturers and retailers. For the first time the reader will find detailed biographies of many of the men who founded and ran the companies that gave the world the toasters, the ovens, the grills, and the other kitchen appliances that today we all take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;" />
