  <title>Living with Peacocks - David Moyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This little book provides delightful, down-to-earth insights into what it&#39;s like to actually live with one of the grandest, most beautiful animals on our planet, the peacock. It gives loads of tips on what to feed these birds, sheltering tips, and whether or not to let them roam freely about your property or keep them in a pen. The author will give you lots of useful information about what to expect should you decide to bring home your own birds. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The author relays his own personal experiences from many years of living with and raising peacocks. He shares his observations about what the famous peacock calls mean, how they get along with other animals and with people. He gives you hints about to build effective pens. He also gives you the down sides of co-existing with peacocks so you can make an informed decision about whether it really makes sense for you to bring them into your life. Knowing about the potential problems you could encounter, you aren&#39;t blinded by the beauty of these creatures in making a decision you may later regret. &lt;/P&gt;" />
