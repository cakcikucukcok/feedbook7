  <title>The Winter Harvest Handbook: Year Round Vegetable Production Using Deep-Organic Techniques and Unheated Greenhouses - Eliot Coleman, Barbara Damrosch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Choosing locally grown organic food is a sustainable living trend that&amp;#8217;s taken hold throughout North America. Celebrated farming expert Eliot Coleman helped start this movement with &lt;em&gt;The New Organic Grower&lt;/em&gt; published 20 years ago. He continues to lead the way, pushing the limits of the harvest season while working his world-renowned organic farm in Harborside, Maine.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, with his long-awaited new book, &lt;em&gt;The Winter Harvest Handbook&lt;/em&gt;, anyone can have access to his hard-won experience. Gardeners and farmers can use the innovative, highly successful methods Coleman describes in this comprehensive handbook to raise crops throughout the coldest of winters.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Building on the techniques that hundreds of thousands of farmers and gardeners adopted from &lt;em&gt;The New Organic Grower&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Four-Season Harvest&lt;/em&gt;, this new book focuses on growing produce of unparalleled freshness and quality in customized unheated or, in some cases, minimally heated, movable plastic greenhouses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Coleman offers clear, concise details on greenhouse construction and maintenance, planting schedules, crop management, harvesting practices, and even marketing methods in this complete, meticulous, and illustrated guide. Readers have access to all the techniques that have proven to produce higher-quality crops on Coleman&amp;#8217;s own farm.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;His painstaking research and experimentation with more than 30 different crops will be valuable to small farmers, homesteaders, and experienced home gardeners who seek to expand their production seasons.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A passionate advocate for the revival of small-scale sustainable farming, Coleman provides a practical model for supplying fresh, locally grown produce during the winter season, even in climates where conventional wisdom says it &amp;#8220;just can&amp;#8217;t be done.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;" />
