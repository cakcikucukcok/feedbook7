  <title>Le Tour - Mont Blanc and the Aiguilles Rouges - a Guide for Skiers - Anselme Baud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Discover the skiing downhills of the Tour Mountain in this very detailed and documented book, written by one of the most talented skiers of his generation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Located at the very heart of the highest mountains of Europe, the majestic Tour massif stands as a reference among the most sacred skiing places in the world. When winter comes, this snow-addict heaven offers a unique range of dream slopes, from the easiest to the most breathtakingly high ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anselme Baud is an extreme skiing leading head and one of the best experts of this mountain. From classic skiing hikes to mountaineering competitions, this guide book presents a precise description of all the biggest slopes this mythic area could offer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this volume you can find all the information about Le Tour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks to his charming accounts and instructive advice, Anselme Baud shares with us his precious and wide experience as a high mountain guide and an exceptional skier.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born in Morzine in 1948, Anselme Baud made a mark on the Alps skiing steep slopes history. He was a high mountain guide in 1973, and was one the first who skied extreme downhills in the Alps, the Andes, in Antarctica or in the Himalayas. As an ENSA professor, he supervised during several years the mountain guides training in Bolivia and Nepal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXCERPT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Le Tour ski station is served by the Charamillon-col de Balme lift systems. The skiing here is accessible, ‘user-friendly’ and good for all the family. For the more committed off-piste skier, there is also the descent to&lt;br&gt;Les Jeurs in Switzerland on the north face, above Vallorcine. However, as with any area at the head of a valley, Le Tour is subject to frequent changes in the air currents and you should be aware of what they are doing if you are planning to ski the routes here. In fact, although Le Tour has an image as an area for relatively easy ‘moyenne montagne’ skiing, you should not underestimate the ever-present risks. The accumulation of snow that occurs as a direct result of these specific conditions is responsible, each year, for a number of accidents and avalanches. The high mountains that overlook this mixture of forests and pastures form the eastern extremity of the Mont Blanc Massif and it has been quite calm here since the snout of the glacier avalanched." />
