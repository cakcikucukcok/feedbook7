  <title>Broken Before Battle - Suzette Howe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mixed martial arts (MMA) has been called &amp;quot;the world&amp;#39;s fastest-growing sport&amp;quot; with a huge fan base . . . It&amp;#39;s often identified with violence and greed, but is that an accurate portrayal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many MMA fighters grew up having to overcome bullying, gang activity, drugs, and violence. For them, success as a fighter is not their financial ticket to lifetime security, but&amp;nbsp; an opportunity to share life-altering concepts and inspire others through the sport they enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the mother of MMA champion Dominick Cruz and a mixed martial artist herself, author Suzette Howe has unique access to mixed martial arts athletes across the globe. In &lt;em&gt;Broken Before Battle: Changing Lives Outside the Octagon&lt;/em&gt;, she profiles eight professional MMA fighters and coaches who tell positive stories of triumphing over tragedy, defeating obstacles, and making a life-changing difference in the lives of others. They share private memories of brokenness and ultimate success that will encourage you to be victorious in your own battles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll discover how an active discipline in mixed martial arts can bring astonishing benefits to both adults and youth by teaching better ways to deal with conflicted emotions and building skills that help improve concentration, behaviors, and attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Broken Before Battle: Changing Lives Outside the Octagon &lt;/em&gt;is the first in a trilogy by Suzette Howe, forged from her one-on-one personal relationships with fighters and others in MMA. Look beyond the hype and into the hearts of these remarkable individuals and their families to hear what they are yearning to share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
