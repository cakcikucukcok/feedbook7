  <title>Tom Danielson&#39;s Core Advantage: Core Strength for Cycling&#39;s Winning Edge - Tom Danielson, Allison Westfahl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tom Danielson&#39;s Core Advantage&lt;/i&gt; offers a simple, highly effective core strength program for cyclists. This comprehensive approach shows the 50 essential core workout exercises that will build strength and endurance in the key core muscles for cycling-no gym membership required. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professional cyclist Tom Danielson used to have a bad back. He shifted in the saddle, never comfortable, often riding in pain. Hearing that core strength could help his back, he started doing crunches, which made matters worse. He turned to personal trainer Allison Westfahl for a new approach. Danielson and Westfahl developed all-new core exercises to build core strength specifically for cycling, curing Danielson&#39;s back problems. Better yet, Danielson found that stronger core muscles boosted his pedaling efficiency and climbing power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Danielson&#39;s core exercises, cyclists of all abilities will enjoy faster, pain-free riding. Cyclists will perform simple exercises using their own body weight to build strength in the low back, hips, abs, chest, and shoulders without adding unwanted bulk and without weights, machines, or a gym membership. Each Core Advantage exercise complements the motions of riding a bike so cyclists strengthen the right muscles that stabilize and support the body, improving efficiency and reducing the fatigue that can lead to overuse injuries and pain in the back, neck, and shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginner, intermediate, and advanced training plans will help bike racers, century riders, and weekend warriors to build core strength throughout the season. Each plan features warm-up stretches and 15 core exercises grouped into workouts for injury resistance, better posture, improved stability and bike handling, endurance, and power. Westfahl explains the goal for each exercise, which Danielson models in clear photographs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riding a bike takes more than leg strength. Now &lt;i&gt;Tom Danielson&#39;s Core Advantage&lt;/i&gt; lays out the core strengthening routines that enable longer, faster rides.&lt;/p&gt;" />
