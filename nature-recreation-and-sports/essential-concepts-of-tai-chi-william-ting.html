  <title>Essential Concepts of Tai Chi - William Ting</title>
      <meta name="description" content="IN Master Tings second book, he sets forth a far deeper path of discovery for the Tai Chi practitioner of every style and level. Master Ting describes and explains the Basic Foundational Principles normally shared only between the closed-door student and the Master under whom he studies.
What makes this book stand out is the clarity of language and imagery used to explain concepts often misunderstood, or simply missing, due to translation difficulties and a reluctance to share this special knowledge with
more than just a privileged few. He carefully presents, chapter by chapter, a blueprint of study which ultimately reveals the internal elements so often forgotten or overlooked by modern students.
If you are looking for a Tai Chi book written in clear, understandable, and visual language that you will come back to again and again for advice and suggestions, this is that book. What Master Ting hopes to do is to make you the master of your own Tai Chi." />
