  <title>Camp Granny - Rebecca McKeever</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Camp Granny takes place one week each summer. This year, it gets off to a bumpy start. Big storms delay five of the six cousins. Becca arrives first and discovers she has forgotten her favorite stuffed animal. She and Granny come up with a collage art project to recreate her toy friend. As the cousins eventually arrive at camp, Becca plays art teacher, and everyone makes their own art projects. Events beyond their control coupled with artistic errors allow the cousins to incorporate their own ideas along the way. Rainy days give the kids and Granny time to make several projects each. New ideas abound. Each cousins contribution to the process is shared with their parents in a parade at the end of the campa grand parade of mistakes.
Eighteen sample projects make up a parade showing the progression of mishaps and their various solutions. Granny and the older cousins add shading, background, and even realism. Every artist, regardless of age or skill, will find a sample that appeals to them. Instructions are included to create your own collage picture including an animal pattern. What will you discover by making mistakes?
Materials kit for making ten collage projects is available separately." />
