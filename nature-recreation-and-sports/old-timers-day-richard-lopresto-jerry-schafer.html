  <title>Old Timers Day - Richard LoPresto, Jerry Schafer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Satan and God Almighty choose up sides for the ultimate fantasy baseball game of all time.&amp;nbsp;One hundred of baseball&amp;#39;s greatest players living and deceased play at historic Ebetts Field where the future of Mankind hangs in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if God and the Devil were to draft their own fantasy baseball game? &amp;nbsp;And what if they really played that game with players living and dead, in the ghost of Ebbets Field&amp;mdash;with the fate of the universe hanging in the balance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one of my visits to Central Christian Church in Henderson, Nevada, God spoke to me and told me I was chosen to write the story called &amp;nbsp;Old Timers, Day. &amp;nbsp;During my visits to the church, I proceeded to write everything God continued to tell me. &amp;nbsp;Soon, I found myself writing endless notes that prompted me to go to my best friend, the award-winning writer, producer, and director, Jerry Schafer, and together following the notes I had taken and adding my expertise on the subject of baseball, we co-authored the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is my sincere hope that people all over the world will read this book and understand the message it puts forth. All power is the Lord&amp;rsquo;s. &amp;mdash; Richard LoPresto&lt;/p&gt;" />
