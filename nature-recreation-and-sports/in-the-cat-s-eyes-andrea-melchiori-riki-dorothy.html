  <title>In the Cat’S Eyes - Andrea Melchiori, Riki Dorothy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Please meet Si, the cat. This book is the story of a cats journey from Ann Arbor, Michigan, to Los Angeles, California. The 2, 200 mile journey is written from Sis perspective, including the interaction with his owner. Now deceased, Si was a twelve-year-old blue-point Siamese cat.  He was playful, stubborn, smart, and talked a lot, and sometimes even a little bit like us two-legged creatures.
Si had two favorite ways to pass his days, to sleep and to spend as much time with his human friend when she was home. His human friends name is Andrea. Sometimes Si would love to check out what Andrea was doing, even if that meant opening the blinds with his paws to see what was happening on the other side. Another activity Si loved was to travel in the car even though he really disliked the long hours. Looking out the windows he wondered what was ahead, what came next, and his human friend could observe that intense attention paid by her cat to the changing scenery. Indeed, Si trusted his owner with everything to keep him safe.
Cats quite possibly have an inner voice that speaks to them just like human voices speak to us. These voices could propel them into action, what to do next, when to eat, where to sleep and perhaps even what toys to play with.  Si oftentimes made such decisions (or so it seemed to his human friend): whether to bug her for playtime or to come running when he heard the car keys jingling. This book is about one of Sis adventures, an activity that started when his human friend Andrea grabbed those car keys for a long trip across the Unites States." />
