  <title>This Organic Life: Confessions of a Suburban Homesteader - Joan Dye Gussow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Joan Dye Gussow is an extraordinarily ordinary woman. She lives in a home not unlike the average home in a neighborhood that is, more or less, typically suburban. What sets her apart from the rest of us is that she thinks more deeply--and in more eloquent detail--about food. In sharing her ponderings, she sets a delightful example for those of us who seek the healthiest, most pleasurable lifestyle within an environment determined to propel us in the opposite direction. Joan is a suburbanite with a green thumb, with a feisty, defiant spirit and a relentlessly positive outlook.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the heart of &lt;em&gt;This Organic Life&lt;/em&gt; is the premise that locally grown food eaten in season makes sense economically, ecologically, and gastronomically. Transporting produce to New York from California--not to mention Central and South America, Australia, or Europe--consumes more energy in transit than it yields in calories. (It costs 435 fossil fuel calories to fly a 5-calorie strawberry from California to New York.) Add in the deleterious effects of agribusiness, such as the endless cycle of pesticide, herbicide, and chemical fertilizers; the loss of topsoil from erosion of over-tilled croplands; depleted aquifers and soil salinization from over-irrigation; and the arguments in favor of &quot;this organic life&quot; become overwhelmingly convincing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Joan&#39;s story is funny and fiery as she points out the absurdities we have unthinkingly come to accept. You won&#39;t find an electric can opener in this woman&#39;s house. In fact, you probably won&#39;t find many cans, as Joan has discovered ways to nourish herself, literally and spiritually, from her own backyard. If you are looking for a tale of courage and independence in a setting that is entirely familiar, read her story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
