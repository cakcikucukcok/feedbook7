  <title>Completed Game: Alternate History of Baseball with No Strike Fiascos - Doug Fowler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine no 1994/5 baseball strike/lockout, and steroids being fought in baseball a decade early. The rest of the 1994 season unfolds week by week. Highlights showcase the game&#39;s excitement, the coming storm, and the record chases whose results mirror the uncertain future which comes because of this history&#39;s steroid scandal. This 1998 will be memorable for an entirely different reason from ours, as owners act to cut costs one way or another. Seasons from 1994-2013 - with an emphasis on the earlier years - are discussed with fans able to consider the joy and sorrow different franchises would feel. 1981, of course, was also marred by a strike. The last section shows the 1981 division races month by month. Readers will see the pennant races of a completed 1981, with the playoffs and World Series, plus major award winners and statistical leaders. Changes to 1982 and beyond, minor as they are, are also discussed." />
