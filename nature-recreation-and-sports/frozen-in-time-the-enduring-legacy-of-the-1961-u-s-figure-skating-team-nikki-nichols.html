  <title>Frozen in Time: The Enduring Legacy of the 1961 U.S. Figure Skating Team - Nikki Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;On February 15, 1961, all 18 members of the U.S. World Figure Skating Team were killed in a plane crash, along with 16 coaches, officials, and family members. &lt;I&gt;Frozen in Time&lt;/I&gt; takes readers inside the lives of the young skaters who died in the crash, revealing their friendships, romances, rivalries, sacrifices, and triumphs. The dramatic focus lingers on two families of powerful women: the Owens and the Westerfelds. Maribel Owen, the most famous woman in figure skating at the time, relentlessly drives her two young daughters&amp;#151;pairs champion Mara and the spectacular Laurence, who graced the cover of &lt;I&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/I&gt; on the day she died. Myra Westerfeld, meanwhile, loses her marriage while guiding her daughters Sherri and Steffi to the pinnacle of the sport. Along with the bittersweet personal stories, author Nikki Nichols recounts the U.S. skating program&amp;#8217;s lengthy struggle to rebuild after this devastating accident.&lt;/div&gt;" />
