  <title>Veterinary and Livestock Sector A Blueprint for Capacity Building - Sudhi Ranjan Garg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Livestock sector is indispensable for food security and well-being of the society. A number of disciplines of Veterinary and Animal Sciences are involved in the task of sustainable development of livestock health, production, food safety and public health. There has been rapid progress in intellectual understanding and accomplishments but the real goals can be achieved only by putting the knowledge into practice at a faster pace to catch up with the changing scenario of global food market, transborder animal infections, zoonotic diseases, public health threats and biological disasters. Based on the gap analysis, this book provides blueprints and action plans envisaged by the top academicians, scientists, administrators and planners for future developments in veterinary and livestock sector. It deals with different aspects of Veterinary Sciences, Animal Husbandry and Public Health keeping the society as the ultimate beneficiary in mind. The authors have enriched the chapters with their longstanding professional experiences, own research findings and the latest data to develop the book into an unmatched resource for the students, teachers and academicians in the educational and research institutions dealing with Veterinary Sciences, Animal Sciences, Livestock Production and Public Health. The book is a rich source of invaluable information for the policymakers, planners, Boards and organizations concerned with animal health, animal welfare, livestock production, diseases control, zoonoses and public health. The field functionaries in the Animal Husbandry departments and livestock farms and the veterinary clinicians and professionals in the public as well as private sector will find the book very useful tool for success in their endeavours. Simple language and lucid illustrations make the book quite a reading pleasure." />
