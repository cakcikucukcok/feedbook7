  <title>Best Hikes with Kids: St. Louis and Beyond - Kathy Schrenk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;85 fun and interesting hikes chosen for children ages 10 and under&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most outings are less than 5 miles and have less than 1000 feet of elevation gain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Includes activities to keep kids engaged on the trail&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
The mother of three young children, Kathy Schrenk formed a social media group for parents who wanted to join her and her kids on hikes around St. Louis. A few years later, that group has nearly 2000 active members. Kathy clearly tapped into an interest and enthusiasm for family hiking, which she has now captured in her new book &lt;i&gt;Best Hikes with Kids: St. Louis &amp; Beyond&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The St. Louis guide is divided into four sections: in and around the city of St. Louis; destinations in nearby Illinois; trails in northwest St. Louis County; and locales farther south, including a variety of state parks and conservation areas. The hike descriptions point out things of interest to kids such as unique geology (caves and sinkholes), places for a quick splash in a creek, or spots to go on the hunt for lizards. Parents will appreciate cautions about sharp drop-offs or tips for potty time on the trail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Other features of the guide include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tips and strategies for hiking with kids—how to motivate them, what’s appropriate for different ages, sidebars with games, nature facts, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct and accurate driving directions and notes on public transit options where available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Best of” lists highlight groups of top 5 hikes with special features to help parents select trips their kids will enjoy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access details including GPS trailhead coordinates and info on permits, fees, and other info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notes about barrier-free or ADA-accessible trails and suitability for jogging strollers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full color photos throughout and detailed maps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
