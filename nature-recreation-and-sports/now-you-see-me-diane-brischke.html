  <title>Now You See Me - Diane Brischke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Diane spent many hours walking the paths at the zoo photographing all the animals, not only at the city zoo but also the Childrens Zoo. When the Childrens Zoo was closed many of the animals she had come to know only to meet them again when they were relocated at the city zoo.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
While on one of her photographic journeys to the main zoo, she happened to meet a wonderful man who was a docent, that is considered a mini-zoologist and is able to educate the visitors on facts the different animals and answer the many questions they had. After a pleasant conversation she was told she would make a good docent. The first opportunity did not begin until later that year but she volunteered and was trained as an educator in the Outback, where she educated visitors about the Red Kangaroos and eventually Bennetts Wallaby. When the docent program was finally open she signed up and began her education in the study of different species of animals, habitats, behaviors and conservation. It was because of her educational background, she was asked to become one of the docents advanced educational programs. This program gave her the opportunity to visit schools, libraries, retirement centers and a number of other establishments where she did presentations on many topics where she showed skulls, skins and replicas of the animals. She believes that hands on approach along with a visual presentation will pique the interest in the conservation of the futures of these animals. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
She supports many conservation organizations that bring awareness to the public about the many animals that are suffering from many dangers that are causing their numbers to sadly decrease to a level of near extinction. Zoos across the country and abroad participate in the Species Survival Program where animals that are on the brink of extinction have attempts to reproduce and keep the species alive. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dianes current position is as Director of Youth Education at the Belle Isle Aquarium in Detroit where she teaches the world of marine life and the dangers facing our oceans." />
