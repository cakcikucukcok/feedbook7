      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ishbel Rose Holmes was adrift and alone when she set out to bicycle across the world.&lt;/b&gt; She was pedalling across Turkey when a street dog, Lucy, crossed her path and changed her life forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ishbel did not want anything or anyone to slow her down, but when she witnessed Lucy attacked by other dogs, Ishbel rescued her—forming a deep bond between the pair.
