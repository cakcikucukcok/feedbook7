  <title>More Than Honey: The Survival of Bees and the Future of Our World - Markus Imhoof, Claus-Peter Lieckfeld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;#147;If 70 percent of all cattle or 30 percent of all chickens were to die annually, states of emergency would be declared everywhere. The death of bees is at least that dramatic and with even more far-reaching consequences.&amp;#8221; &lt;I&gt;More Than Honey&lt;/I&gt;, the book based on the award-winning documentary of the same name, takes us on a global tour of the world of bees, introducing us along the way to &amp;#147;killer bees,&amp;#8221; Frankenbees, beekeepers, and human pollinators. Markus Imhoof and  Claus-Peter Lieckfeld examine both the history and current status of our relationship to and reliance on bees, and expose the human behaviors that are contributing to the decline of the bee population&amp;#151;a decline that could ultimately contribute directly to a world food problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The authors intersperse information about the intricate social structure of the bee world and the problems faced by bees&amp;#151;ranging from the ubiquitous Varroa destructor to overuse of pesticides and an ever-shrinking natural landscape&amp;#151;with conversations and interviews with beekeepers and bee experts from across the world, balancing the views of those who see bees as simply a valuable source of income with the views of those who see bees as undervalued, misunderstood creatures that need our help to survive. The end result is a fascinating, accessible overview of a species that is crucial to our survival.&lt;/div&gt;" />
