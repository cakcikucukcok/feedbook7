  <title>Alabama Studio Sewing + Design - Natalie Chanin, Sun Young Park</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alabama Studio Sewing + Design &lt;/i&gt;is an invaluable reference for any woman who has dreamed of creating her own gorgeous handmade wardrobe. In this follow-up to &lt;i&gt;Alabama Stitch Book &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Alabama Studio Style&lt;/i&gt;, author Natalie Chanin presents all of the stenciling, hand-stitching, and bead¬ing techniques her company uses to create the award-winning Alabama Chanin line of organic cotton clothing, plus more than 50 variations that lead to infinite design possibilities. Included in this encyclopedic compilation of Alabama Chanin skill and style are patterns and instructions for dresses, skirts, tops, a wrap, a poncho, a bolero, fingerless gloves, and a hat. Each piece is featured in both its basic form and with varying embellishment combinations. By mixing, matching, and layering, a stunning, unique, and versatile wardrobe can be built.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Praise for Alabama Studio Sewing + Design:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Transform organic or recycled materials into clothing or home décor items with haute homespun flair.+?&lt;br&gt;
--&lt;i&gt;Better Homes and Gardens Quilts and More&lt;/i&gt; magazine&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Natalie is beautifully simple, yet elegant, just like her clothing. Her signature look is intricate stitching, beading and applique on basic organic cotton jersey which together make a show stopping casual look.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;SF Unzipped&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;I&#39;m a longtime fan of Natalie&#39;s clothing designs . . . Her sewing patterns do not disappoint. These are the same dresses, tops, skirts, and accessories that carry four-figure price tags and are coveted by ec-groovy lady rock stars. The same ones. But in her books, Natalie teaches you how to make them yourself . . . Natalie&#39;s pieces are so simple to sew together . . . They go together in a single evening, and when you pull them on they don&#39;t just make you look better than you did in whatever you were wearing before, they make you feel better.&quot; --Heather Ross, HeatherRoss.Squarespace.com&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The photographs in this volume are exceptional . . . I think if quilters get this book for both technique and inspiration, it will be more than worth the money.&quot; --Meg Cox, quilter and author of &lt;i&gt;The Book of New Family Traditions&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;I just love that Natalie has the guts to share the tricks of her trade. The reason I say guts is that you would think that sharing how your garments are made might hurt your business--but in Natalie&#39;s case it&#39;s proved to be actually quite the opposite . . . The interest in her couture line grew once she started to write books.&quot; --Cathy Callahan, Cathy of California blogger and author of &lt;i&gt;Vintage Craft Workshop&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
