      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Learn all the &lt;em&gt;do&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;ts&lt;/em&gt; of golf!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golf is the only sport where how you treat the other people in the game is as important as the actual game itself. The rules for playing golf are clearly defined, but how golfers expect other golfers to comport themselves before, during, and after a round is less codified.
