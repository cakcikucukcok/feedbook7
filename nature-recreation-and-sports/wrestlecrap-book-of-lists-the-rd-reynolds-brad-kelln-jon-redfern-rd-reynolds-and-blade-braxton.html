  <title>WrestleCrap Book of Lists!, The - Rd Reynolds, Brad Kelln, Jon Redfern, Rd Reynolds and Blade Braxton...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ever wanted to know the worst career choices pro wrestlers made upon retirement? Or which kung fu chop-socky wrestlers would make Bruce Lee do a backflip in his grave?
The WrestleCrap Book of Lists! has all that - and much more. The gloves are off as best-selling author RD Reynolds and his co-author Blade Braxton pull no punches in looking at some of wrestling&#39;s biggest mistakes, most comical mishaps and most egotistical performers. Among the lists included in this cornucopia of wrestling nonsense are:
-Sights Wrestling Fans Should Never Be Forced To See Again!
-The Greatest Mullets in the History of the Game!
-Porn Stars Who Moonlighted in Wrestling!
-The Proof that DX is really, REALLY Gay!
-The Greatest Mugshots - Featuring Your Favourite Wrestlers!
-The Pieces of Definitive Evidence that WCW May Have Been Run By Nazis!
-Pro Wrestling&#39;s Stupidest Hometowns!
-The Things That Vince McMahon Always Wants to Talk About (Half of Which Involve His Genitalia)!
Of course, we&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t mention the book&#39;s craptastic main event: the 25 Worst Gimmicks of All Time.
Irreverent, off-kilter, and certain to be offensive to all, The WrestleCrap Book of Lists! is pro wrestling&#39;s very worst of the worst!" />
