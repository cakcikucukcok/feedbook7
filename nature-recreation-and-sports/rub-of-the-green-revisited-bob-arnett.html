  <title>Rub of the Green Revisited - Bob Arnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On and off the links, Bob has been a strong competitor and an even stronger friend to fellow aficionados of the game. He taught golf for beginners in grades 4 through 8 in Vigo County for five summers before he coached high school golf for 26 seasons, the past 24 at Terre Haute South where his boys finished second, third and fourth at the IHSAA State Finals and his girls claimed eighth in the 
1988 finals. Bobs students have gone on to display exceptional sportsmanship, win championships and secure positions as golf pros and competitive professionals around the country. As a result, in 1994, Bob was inducted into the Terre Haute Golf Association Hall of Fame. He is also in the Indiana Golf Coaches Hall of Fame. 
Bobs competitive golf game was set in motion when he won the Terre Haute Junior title in 1949. He later played at Indiana State Teachers College, now Indiana State University (ISU), and was the No. 1 player for three seasons, winning three Indiana Collegiate Conference titles and two Little State Championships. He was named ISUs Most Outstanding Athlete in 1954, the first golfer in the history of the institution to win the award. 
He won three Casey Opens, the Spaghetti Open, the Roundup of Champions and the 1988 City Seniors Championship. Bob teamed with Art Blakely to win the Terre Haute Four Ball title in 1963 and was medalist in the 1971 Terre Haute Golf Association Interclub Tournament. He has also served as president of the Rea Park Mens Club, Hulman Links Mens Club and the Terre Haute Golf Association." />
