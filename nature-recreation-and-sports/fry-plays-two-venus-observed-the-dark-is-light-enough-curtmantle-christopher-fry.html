  <title>Fry: Plays Two (Venus Observed; The Dark Is Light Enough; Curtmantle) - Christopher Fry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Includes the plays Venus Observed, The Dark is Light Enough and Curtmantle&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This volume of Christopher Fry&#39;s original stage work concludes his &#39;Season Plays&#39; with &lt;i&gt;Venus Observed&lt;/i&gt; (&#39;Autumn&#39;) and &lt;i&gt;The Dark is Light Enough&lt;/i&gt; (&#39;Winter&#39;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the first of these, commissioned by Laurence Olivier, a confident but ageing duke asks his grown-up son to choose a new wife for him. Written with a superbly light touch, this is a surprisingly reflective play about love, power and forgiveness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Dark is Light Enough&lt;/i&gt;, set during Hungary&#39;s revolt against Austria in the 1850s, concerns an imperious, inscrutable aristocrat who seems prepared to sacrifice family and household for the sake of her daughter&#39;s scapegrace ex-husband.&lt;br&gt;Also included is Fry&#39;s biographical play about King Henry II, &lt;i&gt;Curtmantle&lt;/i&gt;. Working with the &#39;epic&#39; theatrical style of the time and utilising a new, leaner verse language, Fry captures Henry&#39;s energy, quick wit and quick temper, his relationship with Thomas Becket - Chancellor and friend, Archbishop and enemy - and his ultimately tragic struggles with his four ambitious sons&lt;/p&gt;" />
