  <title>Top 50 Most Popular Modern Coins - Eric Jordan, John Maben</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h2&gt;The Best of Today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You want to assemble a great coin collection, but your budget is limited.&lt;/b&gt; You’re never going to be able to spend $10,000 or more for a gold coin from the 1800s. But that’s okay. Today’s modern U.S. coins offer collectors an opportunity to amass a collection of beautiful coins at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;Coins that were once considered a novelty of sorts, or just bullions for metals investors, have earned their place in numismatics. Today they represent a significant portion of all coins sold and are taken seriously by the market at large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Top 50 Most Popular Modern Coins&lt;/i&gt; shows you the “best of the best” in terms of popularity, scarcity and affordability. Using the 50 coins listed in this reference as a beginning, you can find your direction of choice in modern coins collecting by date, mintmark, or by composition. You may also choose the challenge of just collecting the 50 issues the authors have selected as the “best of the best.”&lt;br /&gt;This book may well prove to be your most valuable tool in identifying and learning about the modern coins that are a must for all contemporary coin collectors.&lt;/p&gt;" />
