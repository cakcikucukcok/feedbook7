  <title>The Greyhound: An Owner&#39;s Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet - Daniel Braun Stern</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is our seventh set of &lt;I&gt;Happy, Healthy Pet&lt;/I&gt; titles. Like the others, they are books pet owners can turn to for the essential information they need to raise a healthy, happy pet. All books contain information on:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;feeding&lt;LI&gt;grooming&lt;LI&gt;housing&lt;LI&gt;health care&lt;LI&gt;what to expect from the pet&lt;LI&gt;basic training&lt;/UL&gt;As our series expands and focuses on different kinds of pets, the emphasis remains on making the pet a companion. Owners of more unusual pets will particularly appreciate the expert advice in these books because professional care for exotic animals can be hard to come by. As always, the instruction on the books is from exper-people who know their pets intimately but always remember what it was like to have one the first time. &lt;I&gt;Happy, Healthy Pet&lt;/I&gt; guides are rich with professional quality color photos and are designed to be enjoyable and easy to learn from. Most new Greyhound owners will be acquiring an ex-racer as a pet, so we&#39;ve chosen Daniel Stern, an activist for the cause of Greyhound adoptions to write this straightforward guide covering all aspects of their care." />
