  <title>Carl Larsson - Klaus H. Carl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Slip into the idyllic world of turn-of-the-century, rural Sweden with this monograph dedicated to Carl Larsson, the national treasure whose delicate drawings and paintings proffer a vision of his enchanting family life. Accompanying details of every work of art offer an invaluable insight into the exquisite, charming minutiae of these pictures which demand a closer look. Beloved Swedish artist Carl Larsson (1853-1919) emerged from poor beginnings to earn an esteemed place in the hearts and minds of his countrymen. Nowadays known worldwide for his delicate, luminous pictures of his family and their idyllic life in the Swedish countryside, he initially struggled as a painter for many years before finding international fame as a book illustrator. His delicate, charming portraits and major decorative projects in the Stockholm Opera House and the National Museum are deservedly much admired, despite the criticism he provoked from conservative art institutions. Yet it is undoubtedly his series of watercolors and pen-and-ink drawings showcasing the innovative interior design of the house he created together with his wife Karin which are cherished above all, for their vision of a happy, stylish, modern home which he offered to his millions of readers." />
