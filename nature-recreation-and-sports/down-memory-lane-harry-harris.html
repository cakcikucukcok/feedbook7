  <title>Down Memory Lane - Harry Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Ever since Fever Pitch there have been a handful of accomplished personal accounts of an individual&amp;amp;#8217;s love-affair with their football club. They have all followed in the footsteps of Nick Hornby&amp;amp;#8217;s classic, seen through a one dimensional fan&amp;amp;#8217;s perspective. This account is different. Very different. Excitingly different. Here, Harry Harris, arguably the nation&amp;amp;#8217;s Number 1 football story getter for a generation, gives a fan&amp;amp;#8217;s view of life as a Spurs supporter for 50 years, but with a unique insight into players, managers and personalities behind the scenes gleaned through his unique inside track on events within a football club with his unrivalled access. Harry has been so influential within White Hart Lane that he has advised and influenced many a Spurs chairman, including Sir Alan Sugar and Irving Scholar. Harry also reveals the remarkable and sensational behind the scenes secrets of takeovers and player transfers. This book is a must for all Spurs fans who have followed the club since the Glory, Glory days of the 1960s, and for those who want to know what really made Bill Nicholson tick, but also for any football fan interested in the truth about the power struggles being mirrored today at clubs like Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal and Portsmouth. Harry has rubbed shoulders with Pel&amp;amp;#233;, Maradona, Johan Cruyff and George Best, but also includes Glenn Hoddle, Ossie Ardiles, Gary Mabbutt, Paul Gascoigne, Gary Lineker and Steve Perryman, among his all-time favourite footballers and personal friends with interesting accounts of their feats on the field and what they are really like off it. Down Memory Lane is a riveting account of one man&amp;amp;#8217;s on and off love affair and its nostalgic approach is matched with behind the scenes knowledge of players, directors and owners. With exclusive interviews with former managers Gerry Francis, Glenn Hoddle, Ossie Ardiles, Paul Miller and many more including the new manager Harry Redknapp, Down Memory Lane is sure to become another bestseller from Harry Harris!&lt;/div&gt;" />
