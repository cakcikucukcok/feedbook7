  <title>Little League to the Major Leagues - Rod Humphries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is no question that the physical and mental demands of the sport of baseball are rigorous. Not only is it difficult to successfully hit a ninety-mile-per-hour fastball in front of a crowd of passionate spectators, but it is also challenging to navigate an often confusing system that leads players through youth leagues, high school, college, and for a lucky few, the Minor and Major Leagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rod Humphries, sports journalist, television writer, and former administrator of a worldwide professional tennis tour, shares his personal experiences and advice from experts in this complete insiders guide designed to help players, their parents, and baseball fans understand how Major Leaguers pay their dues. Humphries, who closely studied the entire baseball assembly line when his son was drafted out of high school by the Houston Astros, offers valuable information on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Little League to the Major Leagues&lt;/i&gt; provides proven tips and time-tested advice for any family or player who dares to dream of journeying beyond youth baseball to high school, college, and the professional game.&lt;/p&gt;" />
