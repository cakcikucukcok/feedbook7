  <title>Stash and the Adventures of the Coal Cousins - Natalie Washo, Sophie Washo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;About Stash and the Adventures of the Coal Cousins&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stash is a wise old dog who lives with two sisters Cece and Lele. They all go on adventures with their cousins and learn important lessons for all kids!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;The story/authors/Art from the Heart charity&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Adventures of the Coal Cousins follows Cece and Lele in fun childhood adventures, where they learn important lessons from Stash the dog. In this story the Coal Cousins find a map and go on adventure to find the mysterious Crystal Mountain!  The problem is, they venture out after school, when it starts to get dark outside, and forget to tell their parents where they were going!  Follow the sisters and cousins on this exciting adventure, with unexpected twists and turns, as they learn valuable lessons from Stash the dog at the end!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The book and illustration concepts are written by Sophie (age 10) and Natalie (age 8) Washo, created in memory of Sophie and Natalie Washo&#39;s Grand-Dad Michael Washo, who passed away from heart complications while battling cancer. The stories draw inspiration from 3 generations of Washo&#39;s, Malitskys, and Cameron&#39;s by combining childhood stories from all generations as if everyone are kids at the same time. In the first book &quot;Little Mikey&quot; is Grand-Dad Washo, &quot;Cece and Lele&quot; are Sophie and Natalie Washo and introducing &quot;Krusty&quot; based on cousin, TJ Gennaro..  A percentage of the net proceeds will benefit the Michael Washo Art from the Heart charity established to draw awareness to heart risks associated with chemo and radiation treatments to patients battling cancer. Thank you for the support!&lt;/p&gt;
