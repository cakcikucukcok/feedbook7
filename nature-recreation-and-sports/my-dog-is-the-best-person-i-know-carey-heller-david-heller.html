  <title>My Dog Is the Best Person I Know - Carey Heller, David Heller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Dog Is the Best Person I Know is an outrageously funny and heartwarming look into
childrens relationships with their four-legged canine family members. In the way that only brighteyed,
perceptive youngsters can do, children from four to thirteen describe in hilarious fashion
what a dogs personality is like and how the four-legged set fits into the fabric of family life, while
occasionally tearing apart the fabric of the family sofa!
In this wonderful collection, the children address such appealing topics as the history of how
dogs got to be domesticated, what makes dogs so lovable, a candid comparison of dogs versus cats,
what benefits dogs and people derive from living together, what dogs would say about the people in
their lives, the personal comments veterinarians offer to dogs when patient and doctor are alone,
how to show love to your dog, and why indeed a dog can aptly be called mans best friend.
Here are a few choice examples:
Dogs used to travel in packs, until one day they saw a persons home and thought it was a
bed-and-breakfast for dogs! (Dan, age 11)
Nowadays, all dogs want better foodlike filet mignon! (Jared, age 13)
Who else but a dog would be sloppy enough to want to be close to a man? (Emily, age 11)
Dogs are mans best friend because dogs are color-blind and so they love all the people exactly
the same. (Alyssa, age 11)" />
