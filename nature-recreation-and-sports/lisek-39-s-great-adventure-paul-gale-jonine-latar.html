  <title>Lisek&#39;s Great Adventure - Paul Gale, Jonine Latar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Liseks Great Adventure is a story about a young half beagle, half pug dog named Lisek (pronounced Lee-seck) that was taken in and loved, for years, by a young boy and his parents.  Its a story from this little dogs perspective, expressing her joy and how much friendship can be had between a child and his first pet.  As for the dogs name, it was chosen by the author when he visited Poland, met a dog named Lisek, and liked that it translated into Little Fox.  When the author came back to California and got his own dog, he used that name.  This story which is beautifully illustrated by Jonine Latar, is designed to teach children how fun it can be to have an animal and the responsibility that comes with it.  Its also meant to bring a smile to adults who remember the happiness they experienced with their first pet.  This book was conceptualized by Paul when he was just 12 years old and finally came to, after he turned 28.  The author is proud to have finally put together the story hes had on his mind for 16 years.  And his words to the reader, are, if you have an idea or a passion, run with it and make it happendont wait." />
