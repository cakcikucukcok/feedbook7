  <title>Modelling Heavy Industry: A Guide for Railway Modellers - Arthur Ormrod</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Railway layouts often depict a branch line in a rural or urban setting, with the majority of locomotive models available representing passenger trains.  However, increasingly, ready-to-run models of industrial locomotives are becoming available, providing a unique opportunity to place them into an industrial context.  This highly illustrated book provides all the guidance and inspiration needed to begin placing these models in their natural, industrial environment.  The book defines heavy industry and considers real-world examples from &#39;inside the fence&#39;, and describes the tools, materials, parts and fittings most suited to the construction of very large structures. It goes on to provide step-by-step descriptions of several build projects including a gas holder, a cooling tower and an open hearth melting shop, and shows how to make the most of resin buildings, kits and scratch-building. It also demonstrates the construction of industrial structure models in a variety of scales and explains the development of an industrial locomotove fleet, specialized rolling stock and road vehicles with which to populate an industry. Suitable for railway modellers of varying abilities and in any scale, and fully illustrated with 281 colour and 26 black &amp; white photographs." />
