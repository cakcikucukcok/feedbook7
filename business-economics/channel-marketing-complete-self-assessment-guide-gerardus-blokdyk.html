      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How do we make it meaningful in connecting Channel Marketing with what users do day-to-day?  How would one define Channel Marketing leadership?  How do we ensure that implementations of Channel Marketing products are done in a way that ensures safety?  What are all of our Channel Marketing domains and what do they do?  What management system can we use to leverage the Channel Marketing experience, ideas, and concerns of the people closest to the work to be done?
