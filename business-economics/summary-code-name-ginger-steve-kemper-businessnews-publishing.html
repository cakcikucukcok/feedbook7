  <title>Summary: Code name Ginger -Steve Kemper - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “CODE NAME GINGER: The Story Behind Segway and Dean Kamen’s Quest to Invent a New World” by Steve Kemper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the story of Dean Kamen, who as a child found school so boring that he took a playful interest in electronics, a hobby that had him earning $60,000 a year before setting foot in college. Upon his brother’s recommendation Dean came up with a device to monitor hospital IVs automatically without the constant attention of nurses.  This was amongst the first of many successes for Dean, who went on to found his own R&amp;amp;D Company called DEKA. His success is due in part to genius in part to an insightful and humble framework of philosophies and truisms - “Don’t solve the solution. Solve the problem”, “Be a systems integrator” (rather than an inventor!), and “Good artists borrow. Great artists steal” (a line ironically stolen from Picasso). DEKA’s most ground-breaking work was in the improvement of wheelchair design, creating a smoother movement over street curbs and pavements. His dedicated team created two new models – Fred (inspired by the dance moves Fred Astaire), and eventually, following some further technological developments they created Ginger, the real thing.&lt;br&gt;This stirring story describes how one truly creative and innovative individual, persevered against the odds to make a small pipe dream grow into a reality – a project with funding, research, marketing and incredible press. When Ginger was finally launched it caused a great commotion and changed the lives of wheelchair users forever. The Segway Human Transporter as it is now known, possesses a unique technology which makes the world a better place – a wonderful ending to a deeply moving and inspiring story." />
