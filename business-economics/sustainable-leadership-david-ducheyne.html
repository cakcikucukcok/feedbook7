  <title>Sustainable Leadership - David Ducheyne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;How to lead efficiently in a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Leadership has never been as difficult as it is today. And it has never been as crucial. In this VUCA world people ask leaders to provide certainty. They cannot. In the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world certainty comes from character. Leaders can base their leadership on empathy, fairness, kindness and reciprocity. These basic human elements are under pressure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book provides both emerging and established leaders with the ingredients they need to develop a sustainable leadership style.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EXCERPT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A newly appointed CEO wrote that she wants to find a balance between her own values and what is expected from her. I hope for her that both are not too far apart. The board of the company chose her to do the job because of who she is, not because of who she is not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And here is the main challenge for those who are in a leadership role. How can you be a leader and still remain yourself? Something in leadership or in its context seems to urge people to change and become someone else. But leaders are not actors. If I can give only one advice: do not change who you are. You can be (come more of) yourself and grow as a person. But the moment you try and change who you are, you lose the only thing that is sustainable and dear&lt;br/&gt;to you: your character. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is about sustainable leadership based on character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;David Ducheyne&lt;/b&gt; wrote this book as a source of inspiration for leaders who are looking for ways to maintain their leadership in VUCA times. It’s also a documented intention to try and do better." />
