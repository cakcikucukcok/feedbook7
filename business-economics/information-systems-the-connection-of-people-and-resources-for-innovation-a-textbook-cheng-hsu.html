  <title>Information Systems: The Connection of People and Resources for Innovation - A Textbook - Cheng Hsu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This unique new textbook on Information Systems (IS) provides an answer to a few basic questions in the field: What is the scientific nature of IS? How do we design IS in today&amp;#x0027;s connected world? What is the relationship between IS and innovation in knowledge economies? Whereas mainframe corporate computers tended to dominate the thinking in the 1980s, the dominating factor today is personal digital devices that connect the world as one whole IS. Network science is emerging to describe these digital connections (e.g., social networking), and service science is similarly emerging to describe service value networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book therefore synthesizes the emerging network science and service science with the classic IS theory, resulting in a new set of principles for IS strategic planning. It also reviews the standard IS topics of system analysis and database design, covering the whole spectrum of databases and all the major methods and techniques of database design. The role of IS as a technological innovation in the knowledge economy is also analyzed. In doing so, new concepts such as basic values of IS, systems of IS, sustainability of IS, IS as a service system, IS as a human value network, and the hyper-network model for innovation by IS, are developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contents:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information Systems: The Science and Practice of Connecting People and Resources to Create Value&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strategic Planning for Information Systems: Determine the Mission of Innovation and the Scope of the Human Value Networks Involved&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Development of Information System Master Plans: Identify the Optimal Roadmap to Connecting People and Resources According to the Mission&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Process Modeling: Analyze the Specific Information System Resources Required in the Mission and Master Plan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Architectures of Information Integration: From Single Databases and Distributed Databases to Multiple Databases and Internet Databases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Designing Databases: Data Normalization and Data Modeling Using Entity, Relationship, and Object Hierarchy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Techniques of Database Processing: From SQL for Single Databases to Extensions of SQL for Global Query of Independent Databases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Strategic Planning Case: Innovation by Hyper-Networking Humans and Physical Environment to Improve a Regional Economy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information Systems and Knowledge Economy: Review of Select Student Projects, Preview of New Microeconomic Production Functions, and a Case for Optimism&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Readership:&lt;/b&gt; Upper-level undergraduate/postgraduate students and researchers in Information Systems; working professionals who wish to advance their knowledge on IS planning and design.&lt;br&gt;" />
