  <title>The Compassionate Organization - Ethan Chazin Mba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In his second book, &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Compassionate Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, Ethan Chazin business coach and organizational behavior expert explores how organizations build cultures that thrive by leveraging trust, ethics and a moral compass, developing powerfully engaging Vision and Mission statements, and applying the best practices to build effective workplace cultures including: hiring and retention strategies, emotional intelligence, effective communications, branding, diversity &amp; inclusion, employee engagement and empowerment practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days of one employer per career are long gone. In todays contract economy, workers change jobs between eight to ten times by the time they reach 35 years old. Mature workers and Baby Boomers are leaving the workplace by the tens of thousands every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mass exodus of the Mature workforce and Baby Boomers coincides with Millennial workers taking over roles of increasing importance within organizations. Estimates are Millennials will constitute 75-80% of the American workforce by 2020. Organizations have been flattening out their employee ranks by casting off layers of middle management the last few decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this huge transfer in the balance of power from older to younger American workers, Millennials bring with them into the workplace a new set of organizational values, beliefs about work, and a set of ethics and expectations about appropriate organizational behavior. Millennials expect that the organizations they work for (and buy from) share their values, possess a moral compass, and must care for the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, understanding how to build and maintain a compassionate organization should be top of mind for anyone tasked with launching, growing, staffing and leading an organization.&lt;/p&gt;" />
