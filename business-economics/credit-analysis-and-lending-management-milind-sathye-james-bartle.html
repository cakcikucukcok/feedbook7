  <title>Credit Analysis and Lending Management - Milind Sathye, James Bartle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lending is one of the most important functions of any financial institution. If not managed properly, it can lead to credit quality problems, threatening the existence of the financial institution. To manage the lending function properly and mitigate credit quality problems, bank loan officers should be adequately trained in risk assessment techniques. No single textbook has previously covered credit risk analysis and lending management in a comprehensive and complete manner.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;Credit Analysis and Lending Management, Third Edition&amp;#39; is a comprehensive and complete textbook on credit risk management. It is divided into seven parts, containing 16 chapters and 5 case studies. Parts I &amp;amp; II present a framework for assessing and managing credit risk. Parts III &amp;amp; IV include chapters that deal with special types of lending: consumer lending, corporate lending, small business lending and international lending. Part V details credit risk management and measurement techniques, and problem loan management. Part VI then looks at other forms of finance, while Part VII contains the case studies.&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout this text, learning objectives are clearly indicated at the beginning of each chapter, and the chapter content then directly addresses these objectives. Additionally, new concepts are developed in a brick-by-brick manner, and are then supplemented by clear and useful examples.&lt;br /&gt;
This third edition has been fully revised to address issues from the global financial crisis (GFC). It also contains new chapters on micro-finance, agricultural, and quantitative finance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
