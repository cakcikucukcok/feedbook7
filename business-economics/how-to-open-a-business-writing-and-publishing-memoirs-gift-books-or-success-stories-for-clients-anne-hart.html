  <title>How to Open a Business Writing and Publishing Memoirs, Gift Books, or Success Stories for Clients - Anne Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Learn what questions to ask and how to interview people for the significant moments in their life stories, and then write, publish, and bind by hand exquisitely-crafted personal gift books, memoirs, or business success stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words in memoirs or life success story gift books have a life of their own. The purpose of a hand-made, finely bound memoirs or business success-story gift book is to show how two or more people bring out the best in one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;d be surprised how many people are satisfied to pay up to $10,000 (or more depending upon the publisher) to have only one copy of a hand-bound hardcover book published about their event or life story. What does it take to create and publish a memoirs gift book commemorating a Bar Mitzvah, confirmation, wedding, or true experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What quality of personal book do you want to make from scratch-writing, printing, and binding? As far as printing and binding, you can make one finished book at a cost to you of only $1.50?$4.50. What you charge a client depends on what it costs you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you create and publish a custom gift book, you&#39;d publish only one copy of a hand bound, hard-cover book. The tome would contain anywhere from 60 to 100 photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text material based on phone or live interviews running at least two hours for one person (or more if needed and about two hours spent per each interview) would be about 80 to 120 published pages-slightly more, but only if necessary. Look at yourself as a designer, writer, interviewer, and book binder. Learn how to make your own pop-up books for all ages.&lt;/p&gt;" />
