  <title>5 Steps to Take Before Your Next Job Interview - Lawrence Oleary, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lawrence OLeary, PhD, found through his research that up to 90 percent of Fortune 1000 organizations use very similar formats for employment interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He reveals that format and draws upon his more than thirty-five years of experience conducting employment interviews to help job seekers get the positions theyre targeting. Learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify what the interviewers are after in your specific interview, well before you participate in the interview&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop an awareness of the types of questions your interviewer(s) will ask and how to prepare &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare your answers to many of the anticipated questions in your specific interview prior to being interviewed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid a number of behaviors that weaken job interview performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify the types of employment tests that may accompany your interview, what they measure and how to do your best on the tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With a special  chapter  devoted to military veterans they can learn how to communicate the value of many of their military experiences in support of their qualifications for the specific civilian job they are pursuing. In combination with the other seven short chapters, the veteran will go into the entire selection process thoroughly well informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An added value to this book is that it not only prepares you for many types of employment interviews but also the interview for the specific job you are pursuing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just as important, youll learn why competencies are such a focus during the interview, and why employers tend to follow the same format when seeking job candidates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Get the insights and tools that will help you get the job you are pursuing with Five Steps to Take Before Your Next Job Interview.&lt;&lt;p&gt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book gives you a peak behind the curtain of the employment interview to reveal those essential elements all job seekers need to learn in order to best showcase their skills and abilities in the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therese Macan, Ph.D., Professor, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Department of Psychological Sciences at the University of Missouri-St. Louis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The military veteran will find in Chapter 4, Using Your Military Experience as an Asset, an unusually practical guide for translating military language and accomplishments to the civilian world. Any veteran who takes the time to study this chapter and work through the examples can walk into the job interview with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
