  <title>Breaking the Line - David Donachie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The concluding chapter in the epic trilogy that chronicles the private lives dangerous times of England&#39;s greatest naval hero and his legendary mistress. 1799. Having evacuated the King and Queen of Naples ahead of Napoleon&#39;s advancing army, Nelson must now await developments in Sicily. In the meantime, he and Emma savour their passionate affair, and when Nelson travels back to Britain with the Hamiltons, he finds he is the toast of Europe. To the British elite, however, Nelson is a dangerous upstart, and his love for Emma is his weakness. With rising resentment, Nelson and Emma are forced to keep up appearances. As the war with Napoleon drags on, Nelson engages the Danish fleet at Copenhagen with stunning results. Finally he is given the chance he&#39;s been waiting for: off a little-known Spanish cape called Trafalgar, the moment has come to show the world his mettle." />
