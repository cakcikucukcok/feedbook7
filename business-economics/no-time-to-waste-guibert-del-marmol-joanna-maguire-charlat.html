  <title>No Time to Waste - Guibert Del Marmol, Joanna Maguire-Charlat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;When we open our eyes to the world, only one conclusion can be drawn: we are threatened on every side by an apocalypse.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this is an apocalypse in the primary sense of the word: a revelation. What our multiple crises reveal to us is that another world, a different world, is possible.&lt;br&gt;We are at the threshold of a new and crucial Renaissance. All over the world, citizens, businesses and local leaders are initiating a multitude of silent, discreet revolutions. What&#39;s at stake? A planet that is fairer, enduring, and inventive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;No time to waste&lt;/i&gt; proposes a new vision of humanity founded on respect, ecosystems and human dignity. In three sections devoted to food and energy self-sufficiency, the emergence of a regenerative economy and the need for education oriented toward creativity, Guibert del Marmol&#39;s work discusses technologies for the future and offers concrete solutions for getting us there. But beyond these, he warns, there has to be a leap in consciousness, both individual and collective. It is possible to combine science and conscience, offering a confident and bright future to generations to come. We have the means to do, but...there is no time to waste!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A compelling book about today&#39;s society and what we must do to move in the right direction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXCERPT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Camus put it very nicely: our only choice today is to be a laughing pessimist or a crying optimist. The optimist thinks that everything is all right. In French director Mathieu Kassovitz’ “La Haine”, a man falls from the fifteenth floor of a building all the time reassuring himself: “So far so good”.&lt;br&gt;Our world is falling. It falls from a building that it built, when it hoped to strike a deal, after leaping into the void, that he had imagined filled with potential… And although the landing matters more than the void, there’s little point in relying on a golden parachute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guibert del Marmol&lt;/b&gt; is an economist by training and has been a director of several international companies. Today, he is an advisor, author, lecturer, and specialist in the field of the regenerative economy. He also trains leaders in the art and pratice of inspired and inspiring leadership, which combines ancient wisdom and modern technology." />
