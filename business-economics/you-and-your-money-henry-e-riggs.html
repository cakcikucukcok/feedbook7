  <title>You and Your Money - Henry E. Riggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    This book addresses the very many considerations persons face in handling their income, savings, investing, borrowing, protecting against risks, and tax
    planning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Somewhat surprisingly our educational system, at the high school level and beyond, rarely addresses this myriad of issues  both problems and opportunities
    -- that can be categorized as personal finances. Our schools lecture) ceaselessly about the challenges of drugs, sex, alcohol, smoking, social media and
    wellness -- and appropriately so, since young people are exposed to endless opportunities to make poor and harmful decisions regarding each of those
    matters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    But so also are adults at all ages  teenagers to senior citizens  confronted by a host of challenges and opportunities as to how to manage their personal
    finances -- from before they receive their first paychecks and continuing on through retirement and death. As we proceed through high school, college, and
    even graduate school, we may take courses in accounting, finance, economics, and taxation, all of which offer tidbits of advice on handling our personal
    finances, but none are comprehensive in addressing personal finance. This book seeks to fill that void.
