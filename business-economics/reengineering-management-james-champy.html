  <title>Reengineering Management - James Champy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The co-author of the monumental bestseller &lt;em&gt;Reengineering the Corporation&lt;/em&gt; continues the reengineering revolution with another national bestseller that has already sold more than 165,000 copies in hardcover&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reengineering Management&lt;/em&gt; is a brilliant, practical and much needed book on the most powerful management idea of the decade. Reengineering&amp;#8212;changing the traditional and outdated organization, processes and culture of a company&amp;#8212;is corporate America&#39;s greatest challenge today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Reengineering Management&lt;/em&gt;, Champy examines the far-reaching changes managers must make for themselves and their companies to succeed in an era of unprecedented competition. Through his extensive consulting and research work, he shows how reengineering succeeds only when managers reinvent their own jobs and managerial styles. Otherwise, the ultra-efficient and effective reengineered processes for acquiring and serving customers, filling orders, bringing new concepts to market and other key business activities eventually fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Champy illustrates this new management agenda through first-hand experiences of managers of reengineered operations at Federal Express, Wisconsin Electric, CIGNA Health Care, Hewlett-Packard, AT&amp;#38;T Universal Card Services and other companies. Champy shows how they are mastering the managerial challenges of reengineering, and as a result are making their organizations exciting and competitive. As more and more organizations reengineer, the experiences of these managers will become an insiders&#39; guide to managerial life in the company of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reengineering Management&lt;/em&gt; picks up where &lt;em&gt;Reengineering the Corporation&lt;/em&gt; left off&amp;#8212;by exploring the managerial implications of the reengineered workplace. As reengineering becomes critical to all organizations, &lt;em&gt;Reengineering Management&lt;/em&gt; will be the road map for managerial success in the future. It is, indeed, the manifesto for the next managerial revolution.&lt;/p&gt;" />
