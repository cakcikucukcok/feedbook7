  <title>Education for a Bright Future in Greece - Collectif</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After a decade of severe fiscal crisis also impacting education, Greece is looking ahead. Now is the time to invest effectively in education and define a forward-looking path for Greece. Building on the current reform agenda, this report offers an analysis of the context and underlying policy issues that once addressed, can contribute to raising the quality and equity of education in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on evidence and international experience, the review highlights policy options that can guide and enhance current reform efforts in Greece in four areas: effective governance; policies for school improvement; efficiency, equity and quality of the education system; tertiary education. How can the governance and financing of Greek education be streamlined and improved? How can Greece achieve greater equity in educational provision and student outcomes? How can the Greek - qualified and well engaged - teaching force help promote school improvement? Last but not least, how can higher education help Greece restore prosperity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report takes a hard look at the above issues, and many others. It will offer precious insights to policy makers and the education community.&lt;/p&gt;" />
