  <title>Put College to Work: How to Use College to the Fullest to Discover Your Strengths and Find a Job You Love Before You Graduate - Kat Clowes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The future looks bleak for today&#39;s college graduates: 53 percent of Millennials are jobless or underemployed after graduating college, and 36 percent have moved back in with their parents. College tuition has tripled in the last decade, debt at graduation has risen to a full year&#39;s salary, and more graduates are forced to default on their student loans. Meanwhile, college is not preparing students for the modern job market-wages are stagnating, employers aren&#39;t hiring, and young people today can expect to change careers five or six times in their lifetime. The old rules for succeeding in college just don&#39;t work anymore. &quot;Put College to Work&quot; is the new rule book that shows how to make today&#39;s college environment work for you. &quot;Put College to Work&quot; presents a step-by-step plan to use the resources available to you in college (the resources you&#39;re already paying for!) to enhance your education with practical experience, make connections with employers, market yourself as a dynamic and creative employee-and land a job before you graduate. &quot;Put College to Work&quot; shows how to identify your strengths, find the right career field and major to pursue, leverage your skills, and create your own opportunities. You&#39;ll learn how to network to employers through your university&#39;s career center, alumni association, and major donors, plus the industry and research connections of your professors. Written by a Millennial for Millennials, &quot;Put College to Work&quot; is a supremely practical guide to how college really works today that will empower you to take action now to build your education, your career plan, your business contacts, and your job prospects." />
