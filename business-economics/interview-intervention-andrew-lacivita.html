Because there are three reasons you actually get the jobnone of which are your qualifications and, unfortunately, you can only control one of them. iNTERVIEW INTERVENTION creates awareness of these undetected reasons that pose difficulty for the job-seeker and permeate to the interviewer, handicapping the employers ability to secure the best talent. It teaches interview participants to use effective interpersonal communication techniques aimed at overcoming these obstacles. It guides job-seekers through the entire interview process to ensure they get hired. It teaches interviewers to extract the most relevant information to make sound hiring decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

? Create self-awareness to ensure you understand the job you want&lt;br&gt;
beforenot afterthe fact.&lt;br&gt;
