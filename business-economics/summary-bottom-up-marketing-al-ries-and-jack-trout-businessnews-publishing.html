  <title>Summary: Bottom-Up Marketing - Al Ries and Jack Trout - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book &quot;BOTTOM-UP MARKETING: Building A Tactic Into A Powerful Strategy&quot; by Al Ries and Jack Trout.&lt;br&gt;Most traditional marketing is carried out top-down. That is, the senior manager decides on a strategy the company will follow and the middle managers decide on the tactics to achieve that strategy. &lt;br&gt;However, in Bottom-Up Marketing, Ries and Trout argue that history’s most successful companies have invariably developed strategy from the bottom-up. In this method, the company first identifies a tactic that is delivering a sustainable competitive advantage in the minds of consumers. The company then focuses its resources on exploiting that tactic to the greatest possible degree by building the tactic into the company’s entire marketing strategy.&lt;br&gt;Bottom-up marketing suggests that the best and most effective way to become a marketing strategist is to put your mind into your marketplace and to find inspiration where customers come into contact with your product or service. By immersing yourself in the tactics of whatever works in reality, you can develop a highly effective marketing strategy.&lt;br&gt;Bottom-Up Marketing is a useful and powerful book which will help you carry out your marketing strategies successfully." />
