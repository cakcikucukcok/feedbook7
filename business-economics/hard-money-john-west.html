  <title>Hard Money - John West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Stop living from paycheck to paycheck. Achieve financial freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everybody wants to scrape together enough money to escape the rat race and live their dreams. But very few people are willing to put in the effort and make the sacrifices required for this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building wealth is not about buying expensive toys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor is building wealth the same as making money. That&amp;rsquo;s like saying that having children is the same as going on a date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And to extend that analogy, as far as salaries are concerned, it&amp;rsquo;s not the size that matters, it&amp;rsquo;s what you do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn how you can save money every month, no matter who you are, or how much you earn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn how to avoid the mistakes that lead to financial ruin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover how the rich and famous throw their money away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And learn why it&amp;rsquo;s better to build wealth slowly than to just have lots of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is no get-rich-quick scheme. It won&amp;rsquo;t be easy. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s called Hard Money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have a very slim chance of winning the lottery. You have a better chance of building wealth slowly. If you have the right attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want it bad enough.&lt;/p&gt;" />
