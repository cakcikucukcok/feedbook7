  <title>Stretch for Change - Razzetti Gustavo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Discover how to thrive in our unpredictable world, reengaging with your passions and improving leadership skills by stretching your mindset, embracing change, and welcoming new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all admire daring innovators. In our own lives, however, it often seems safer to stick with the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change can be frightening, but embracing it can lead to phenomenal growth. &lt;em&gt;Stretch for Change&lt;/em&gt; offers you a new framework to guide you in creating a flexible mindset that is more open to new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change is unavoidable, and for most of us, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to deal with. But you can prepare for it. Just as you would stretch your muscles before a game of tennis, you can stretch your mindset so you are ready when change inevitably comes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are confronted with the need for change, it can trigger your fight-or-flight instinct. But fear isn&amp;rsquo;t the response you need. If you embrace change, it can lead to inspiration&amp;mdash;to new ideas and opportunities that stoke your true passions. Now, change is occurring at a faster rate than ever, making adaptability a serious competitive advantage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stretch for Change explores a new approach to welcoming change in both your personal and professional life. The first step is shifting your mindset. Then you can concentrate on addressing the problems that matter. In inspiring, easy-to-understand language, the book offers a simple framework and exercises to transform your approach to change and includes illustrative case studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Gustavo Razzetti, a sought-after expert on change leadership, provides a pathway to help readers achieve their dreams and join the world of innovators. Choose change, and free yourself to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.&lt;/p&gt;" />
