  <title>The Global Crash of 2015 and What You Can Do to Protect Yourself - David Meade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to profit and survive when a sudden economic collapse arrives in 2015. Great chaos and confusion are going to accompany the crash. There are 3 primary ways you can profit from it.  One is investing into gold shares, coins and bullion.  The second is investment into silver.  The third is that you can diversify a percentage of your holdings into an inverse Exchange Traded Fund (ETF).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the crash occurs it will be too late to invest in the ETF market.  The financial sector of the market will be virtually destroyed. Inverse ETFs, gold and silver will skyrocket to highs that you&amp;#39;ve never seen before.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You need to know the timing since it&amp;#39;s critical to invest at least 2 weeks prior to the event itself.  The shadow government knows that the $18 Trillion in U.S. debt, the $100 Trillion in unfunded liabilities and the 1 Quadrillion in derivatives in the market are not manageable, nor can it ever be repaid.  Their only plan is for a crash, to be followed by a devaluation.  The end result is a financial tsunami the likes of which you have never seen before. The previously engineered prices of gold and silver will no longer be able to be contained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Of course the gold and silver markets are manipulated. You have to be either blind or a Harvard Graduate with a doctorate in Economics to ignore the fact.&amp;quot;  Mexican Billionaire Hugo Salinas Price &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book covers the history you need, the facts you need and a detailed description of the 2015 strategies you must employ. This book reads like an NSA Intelligence Briefing. This book provides you with the tools you need, and the precise timing of the engineered crash to occur later this year." />
