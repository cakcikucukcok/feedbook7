  <title>Summary: Internet Riches - Scott Fox - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book &quot;INTERNET RICHES: The Simple Money-Making Secrets of Online Millionaires&quot; by Scott Fox.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surveys have suggested at least 58-percent of all employees dream of starting their own business but have hesitated because of &quot;insufficient financial resources&quot;. However, many Internet businesses can be set up with the minimum of initial investment – it’s possible, Scott Fox believes, to set up an e-business for less than $25 a month. If you are savvy, and do your research, there is no reason why your business cannot be a success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Contrary to popular wisdom’, Scott Fox says, &quot;the Internet is not &#39;over’. The years 2001-2004 were tough for Internet businesses, but… online sales are continuing to explode and could reach more than $300 billion in the United States alone by 2010.&quot;  Fox (who is a brilliant online entrepreneur himself) explains the components of a successful online start up, and how to align your company with your own skills and interests (the key to long-term success). He suggests methods for cash-flow analysis, business plan analysis, how to search for niches and how to grow your business after the initial beginnings. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Internet Riches is a complete guidebook to setting up you own Internet company. It covers everything from initial research, to the mechanics involved, and best long-term strategies." />
