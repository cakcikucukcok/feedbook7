      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;The Clock Is Ticking . . . Is Your Nonprofit Ready? Boomers are leaving the workforce&amp;#151;soon. Do you have a plan to replace them? How do you relate to GenX and Gen@ employees, volunteers, and donors? What are you doing&amp;#151;today&amp;#151;to adjust your services, your outreach, your mission? Generational change presents as many opportunities for nonprofits as challenges.

From iPod policies to recruiting younger board members, Brinckerhoff shows how you can address generational trends, today, to keep your nonprofit organization relevant and able to meet the changing needs of your staff, volunteers, donors, and the community you serve. Six trends, and what to do about them Generations examines six generational trends that will affect everything you do: 1) financial stress, 2) technological acceleration, 3) diversity of population, 4) redefining the family, 5) MeBranding, and 6) work-life balance. You&amp;#8217;ll come away with an understanding of these trends and how they will impact your nonprofit. Individual chapters provide in-depth information on how to deal with generation issues in each area of your organization&amp;#151;staff, board, volunteers, clients, marketing, technology, and finances. Practical tools help you take action This hands-on guide includes the Generational Self-Assessment Tool. This tool gives you a baseline to measure your success as you bring generations into your planning. Throughout the book, you&amp;#8217;ll find real-life examples that illustrate key points.
