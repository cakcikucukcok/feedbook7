  <title>Summary: Hundred Percenters - Mark Murphy - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “HUNDRED PERCENTERS: Challenge Your Employees To Give It Their All and They’ll Give You Even More” by Mark Murphy.&lt;br&gt;In order to motivate your employees to be 100% workers, you need to be a 100% leader. Mark Murphy has analyzed the style and decisions of 125,000 managers, and discovered that “the two most important differentiating factors in separating exceptional from average leaders are Challenge and Connection. Connection is the strength of the emotional connection a leader builds with his or her people. Challenge is the extent to which a leader pushes his or her folks.” Murphy has found that excellent leaders do 5 things exceptionally well: they set goals that inspire; they use feedback to generate accountability; they give positive reinforcement; they try not to impede employees, and they learn how to deal with Talented Terrors.&lt;br&gt;Hundred Percenters shows how to implement these measures. He explains how to give feedback and criticism so that it won’t be viewed defensively and how important positive reinforcement is to morale. Make an effort to learn what motivates your employees, and what they feel impedes them from doing their job. In short, Hundred Percenters is a valuable, applicable manual for establishing good relationships and excellent productivity.&lt;br&gt;" />
