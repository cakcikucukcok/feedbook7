  <title>What You Don&#39;t Know about Leadership, But Probably Should - Jeffrey A. Kottler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Leadership is not just for CEOs--we all find ourselves in leadership positions at one time or another, whether in meetings and classes or at social events and family gatherings. And yet, even though leadership is the single most studied aspect of all human behavior, there remains a scarcity of qualified leaders to step into critical positions. This deficit is laid bare in the gulf between what leaders are trained to do and how they actually act.
In &lt;em&gt;What You Don&#39;t Know About Leadership, but Probably Should&lt;/em&gt;, Jeffrey A. Kottler translates the latest research, theory, and skills into practical strategies for everyday and professional situations. He presents the wisdom and successful strategies of an array of renowned leaders--from Steve Jobs to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, George Lucas to Admiral Horatio Nelson--while citing the challenges they faced and lessons they learned in their respective roles. The book focuses on key attributes such as self-confidence, flexibility, charisma, and humility, while noting the serious pitfalls associated with traits such as hubris, immodesty, and narcissism. Kottler&#39;s writing is candid and realistic; though there are no easy rules or programs that instantly lead to success, there are steps you can take to make a difference in others&#39; lives, better manage conflict and stress, and ultimately serve as an effective leader." />
