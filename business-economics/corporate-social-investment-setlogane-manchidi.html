  <title>Corporate Social Investment - Setlogane Manchidi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is easily one of the best works yet on how to make corporate social investment work for the benefit of ordinary people … should be required reading by every CSI practitioner in Africa and abroad - much time, money and energy could be saved. - PROFESSOR JONATHAN JANSEN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing an impactful corporate social investment (CSI) strategy and approach with real potential to positively change people’s lives can be a tricky exercise. Those grappling with how best to approach CSI will find thought-provoking insights in this book that will contribute positively to how they view, shape and execute their CSI strategy. In a most accessible way, this guidebook on CSI presents an instructive and constructive way of building a CSI strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setlogane Manchidi, Head of CSI at Investec, is known in the CSI space for his passion and strong desire to see meaningful change in people’s lives. In this book, informed by his experiences as a CSI practitioner over the years, he unpacks what he considers to be essential aspects of CSI practice.  Manchidi adopts and articulates a question-based approach to creating an effective CSI strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising that business is not separate from society, Manchidi suggests that companies need to ask themselves some serious questions, amongst them: Why should they be doing CSI and, importantly, why are they doing it? The questions, which are reflected on the cover of the book, are difficult ones which require complete honesty, deep consideration and the necessity of placing ‘impact’ at the centre of the formulation of CSI strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through this book, Corporate Social Investment, Setlogane Manchidi reminds us of the significance of a carefully considered CSI strategy and approach, especially on a continent such as Africa with many socio-economic challenges that continue to impact negatively on ordinary people’s day-to-day lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
