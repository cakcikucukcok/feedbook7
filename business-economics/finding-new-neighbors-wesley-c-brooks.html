  <title>Finding New Neighbors - Wesley C. Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Clearing the way to close can be a defining process for many professionals in the real estate industry.  This process can easily separate the professional from the amateur or part time agent.  Professional Real Estate Agents and Real Estate Brokers face a tough challenge every day.  Negotiating an offer written on behalf of a buyer; Professional Realtors stand out from the general public as experts in their field.  Whether it&#39;s a matter of disclosure requirements, ethics or simply due diligence on behalf of a transaction, it&#39;s important to seek the advice and representation of a true full time professionally licensed Realtor in every real estate transaction regardless of what side you may be on.
&quot;Finding New Neighbors&quot; takes the reader into the trenches of buying real estate.  If the buyer is looking to purchase a residential home, vacant land or a commercial investment property, this book will cover many of the specialized elements that they will encounter along the way.  No single publication makes up an entire library of information.  As this book reflects the buyers side of real estate, my next book &quot;Echoes in the Hall&quot; will represent the seller&#39;s side of the industry.  In my last book; &quot;Guide to New Custom Home Ownership&quot;, the reader learned about the process of new construction.  Additional publications will be added along the way.
&quot;It is my intent to supply the reader an easy to understand publication that they can use as they proceed in searching for their new home or additional property for their family, future and investments.&quot;  This book is designed with sections dedicated to writing notes and outlines so the reader can share their thoughts and ideas with their chosen agent or lender." />
