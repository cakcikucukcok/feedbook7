  <title>Summary: Buy Rent and Hold - Robert Irwin - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “BUY, RENT &amp;amp; HOLD: How to Make Money in a ‘‘Cold’’ Real Estate Market” by Robert Irwin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Robert Irwin is recognized as America’s #1 real estate expert. A broker and property investor, Irwin has offered buyers and sellers effective solutions to their real estate problems for more than 20 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Buy, Rent &amp;amp; Hold, the author demonstrates that investing in real estate is deceptively simple. As Irwin explains, all you need to know is summed up in the strategy Buy – Rent – Hold. That is: 1. Buy property when the market is tracking downwards before it reaches the bottom; 2. Rent your property aggressively to cover your carrying costs – the mortgage, maintenance, taxes, etc; and 3. Hold the property until the market reaches its peak, at which time you then sell. In essence, that’s all there is to it. Of course, the difference between a theory and actual profits lies in the execution. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Filled with practical tips and techniques, Buy, Rent, &amp;amp; Hold is a must read for investors. Read this work and you will learn how to make big profits even during today’s economic slump!&lt;br&gt;" />
