  <title>Fools Rush In - Nina Munk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Every era has its merger; every era has its story. For the New Media age it was an even bigger disaster: the AOL-Time Warner deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time AOL and Time Warner were considered a matchless combination of old media content and new media distribution. But very soon after the deal was announced things started to go bad&amp;#8212;and then from bad to worse. Less than four years after the deal was announced, every significant figure in the deal -save the politically astute Richard Parsons&amp;#8212;has left the company, along with scores of others. Nearly a $100 billion was written off and a stock that once traded at $100 now trades near $10.&lt;p&gt;What happened? Where did it all go wrong? In this deeply sourced and deftly written book, Nina Munk gives us a window into the minds of two of the oddest men to ever run billion-dollar empires. Steve Case, the boy wonder who built AOL one free floppy disk at a time, was searching for a way out of the New Economy.&amp;#160; Meanwhile Jerry Levin, who&#39;d made his reputation as a visionary when he put HBO on satellite distribution, was searching for a monumental deal. These two men, more interested in their place in history than their personal fortunes, each thought they were out-smarting the other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
