It is DJ Sbu’s firm belief that, if you know how to sell, you will never go hungry. He also believes that this simple skill holds the key to solving Africa’s considerable unemployment problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His passion for youth development comes through loud and clear in this easy-to-read, easy-to-use handbook. Full of practical examples, sound advice and no-nonsense insights, it’s a must-have for every person who wishes to further their lives and their careers, whether in the corporate world or starting out on an entrepreneurial journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DJ Sbu’s career is testimony to his strength, resilience and spirit of innovation; the very qualities needed to get ahead in today’s rapidly evolving business environment. In sharing his story, he hopes to ignite others’ success.&lt;/p&gt;" />
