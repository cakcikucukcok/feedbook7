  <title>Quick and Nimble - Adam Bryant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More than two hundred CEOs reveal their candid insights on how to build and foster a corporate culture that encourages innovation and drives results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Quick and Nimble&lt;/i&gt;, Adam Bryant draws on interviews with more than two hundred CEOs to offer business leaders the wisdom and guidance to move an organization faster, to be quick and nimble, and to rekindle the whatever-it-takes collective spark of a start-up workplace, all with the goal of innovating and thriving in a relentlessly challenging global economy. By analyzing the lessons that these leaders have shared in his regular &quot;Corner Office&quot; feature in &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, Bryant has identified the biggest drivers of corporate culture, bringing them to life with real-world examples that reflect this hard-earned wisdom.&lt;br&gt;These men and women--whose ranks include Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn, Tony Hsieh of Zappos, Angie Hicks of Angie&#39;s List, Steve Case of Revolution (and formerly AOL), and Amy Gutmann of the University of Pennsylvania--offer useful insights and strategies for creating a corporate culture of innovation and building a high-performing organization that unleashes the passion and energy of its employees.&lt;br&gt;As the world shifts to more of a knowledge economy, the winners will be companies that can attract and retain the best and brightest employees by creating an environment where they can grow, contribute, and feel rewarded. Through the wisdom of these leading chief executives, &lt;i&gt;Quick and Nimble&lt;/i&gt; offers a keen understanding of leadership, recruiting, and the forces that shape corporate culture and a clear road map to bring success and energy to any organization.&lt;/p&gt;" />
