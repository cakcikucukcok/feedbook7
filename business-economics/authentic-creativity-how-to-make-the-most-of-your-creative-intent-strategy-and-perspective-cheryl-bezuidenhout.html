  <title>Authentic Creativity: How to Make the Most of Your Creative Intent, Strategy and Perspective - Cheryl Bezuidenhout</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authentic Creativity&lt;/strong&gt; - How to Make the Most of Your Creative Intent, Strategy and Perspective&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Cheryl Bezuidenhout)&lt;/em&gt;, is about unlocking your true potential as a visual artist. It is for creative individuals who seek to balance the challenges of intentions, actions and perceptions every day in their creative world. The book is a guide to discovering untapped creative potential by learning to overcome artistic challenges, solve creative and professional dilemmas and grow into your own &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authentic Creativity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Filled with suggestions, exercises, advice and observations, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authentic Creativity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; will get you started on a path to understanding your creative Intent, Strategy and Perspective today.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The creative process relies on three fundamentals that underpin our decision-making: intent, strategy, and perspective. Keeping these three fundamentals in sync with each other is a requirement for living a fulfilled life as an authentic, creative individual. The harmony of the three is a constant exercise in balancing and rebalancing our intentions, our actions, and our perceptions. With conscious effort and self-awareness, we can break free of the stifling effects of an ordinary life filled with mundane challenges that leave us creatively stumped and drained.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This book can show you how to better equip yourself for an authentic, creative lifestyle, both personally and professionally. It is full of questions to ask yourself, perspectives on what drives our creativity as well as what prevents us from tapping into it. It also reveals how we can benefit from our creativity&amp;rsquo;s great potential. Read about the challenges creativity itself can present, coping with difficult decision processes, and see insights on action/follow through on projects and assignments.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Authentic Creativity is written from the point of view of the author, a seasoned visual artist with over 25 years as a graphic designer, artist and photographer. The insights and experiences in the book are Cheryl&amp;#39;s own and are offered as a way for us all to see what we can discover about our own creativity through self-awareness and the practice of Authentic Creativity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
