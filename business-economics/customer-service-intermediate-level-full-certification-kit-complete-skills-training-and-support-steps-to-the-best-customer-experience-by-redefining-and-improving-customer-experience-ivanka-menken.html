  <title>Customer Service Intermediate Level Full Certification Kit - Complete Skills, Training, and Support Steps to the Best Customer Experience by Redefining and Improving Customer Experience - Ivanka Menken</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Practical, concise help for dealing with customers: The book and its accompanying eLearning course and Certification paves the way for the Best Customer Experience by Redefining and Improving Customer Experience: An Innovative Strategy by the Industry Leader in Effective Customer Service Training.
&lt;p&gt;
We deal with Excellent, and not-so-good customer service every day. Customer Service is always on the agenda. However, these two words involve so much more than simply serving customers. It is solving problems, reassuring the uncertain, calming the infuriated, finding the lost and fixing the broken. The customer service professional is required to be jack-of-all trades to satisfy the expectations of the customer and promises of the company.
&lt;p&gt;
Organizations know that their customer service staff are the frontline of their business. Sales positions are no longer filled with the unmotivated, the unfriendly, the unhelpful and the untrained personnel from yesteryear. They are the point of make-or-break sales and there is now a greater emphasis and importance on maintaining and improving high quality customer service and staff.
&lt;p&gt;
Research has shown highly successful service organizations have lower marketing costs, fewer upset customers and more repeat business - customers are &quot;voting with their feet&quot; which is key when customer loyalty has become obsolete. An added bonus to good service is morale, job satisfaction is higher, and employee absenteeism and turnover are lower.
&lt;p&gt;
This Customer Service Intermediate Certification Kit builds on the Foundation level, with this specific focus on Customer Service:
&lt;p&gt;
- Customer Service and Contact Centers&lt;p&gt;
- Communication Strategies&lt;p&gt;
- Customer Relationship Management&lt;p&gt;
- Delivering Presentations and Public Speaking&lt;p&gt;
- Customer Service and Sales&lt;p&gt;
- Building Relationships with Customers&lt;p&gt;
- Customer Service and Retail&lt;p&gt;
- Conflict Resolution&lt;p&gt;
- Decision Making and Assertiveness&lt;p&gt;" />
