      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “ENTREPRENEURSHIP.COM: How To Create a Winning Dot-Com Business Plan” by Tim Burns. Tim Burns is an author, speaker and business consultant. A graduate of Tulane University, Mr. Burns is a qualified attorney and chartered public accountant, specializing in the areas of taxation, strategic business planning and estate planning. The days of preparing highly detailed, 100-page business plans are over. In the new economy, change is happening constantly. Therefore, a more flexible type of business plan is required which is concise, flexible enough to permit modifications to be made on the fly and focused on one key point – how profitability will be achieved. This is the essence of “The e-Plan”. In just 10 PowerPoint slides, an executive summary and as much narrative as required, the e-Plan conceptualizes the business strategy and model. It encapsulates what the business proposes to do. As circumstances change or new opportunities arise, e-Plans can be adapted quickly and simply. In this practical guide, Tim Burns offers the keys to make a winning e-Plan.The e-Plan is a new generation business plan, optimized for the demands of the Internet business era. Entrepreneurship.com provides valuable insights and fresh ideas for engaging in e-business projects." />
