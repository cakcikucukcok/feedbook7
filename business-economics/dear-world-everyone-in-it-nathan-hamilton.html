  <title>Dear World &amp; Everyone In It - Nathan Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dear World &amp; Everyone In It is a ground-breaking new poetry anthology presenting the work of over 60 of the most talented and interesting young poets currently writing in the UK. Chosen by one of the country&#39;s leading young poetry editors, inspired by American precedents, and growing out of The Rialto&#39;s recent series of young poets features curated by Nathan Hamilton, it is the first British anthology to attempt to define a generation through a properly representative cross-section of work and a fully collaborative editorial process. By drawing on the poets&#39; own recommendations, this anthology represents more effectively and appropriately a new generational mood - hybrid, playful, collaborative, ambitious, inclusive, cooperative. Less top down, more bottom up, it speaks also of other movements in our world, and even ends up challenging parochial notions of Britishness by including overseas poets who live or work here and who have become engaged and influential in the scene. Avoiding, or ironising, older oppositional attitudes, Nathan Hamilton introduces his anthology with an essay describing &#39;this new generation&#39;s hybridisation of two aptly ironic and business-sounding &quot;strains&quot; in UK poeticstaxonomised as &quot;product&quot; and &quot;process&quot;&#39;. His lively analysis juxtaposes modernist approaches with those exploring more traditional modes, hoping to bring some of the pleasures of the former to a wider audience. Dear World &amp; Everyone In It is an indispensable summary or starting map for anyone wanting to explore and enjoy more of the current UK poetry landscape or seeking to better understand what&#39;s going on out there. The poets included are: Rachael Allen, Andrew Bailey, Emily Berry, Ben Borek, Siddhartha Bose, Elizabeth-Jane Burnett, James Byrne, Stuart Calton, Tom Chivers, Tim Cockburn, Becky Cremin, Emily Critchley, Joe Crot, Patrick Coyle, Amy De&#39;Ath, Laura Elliott, Stephen Emmerson, Amy Evans, Ollie Evans, S.J.
