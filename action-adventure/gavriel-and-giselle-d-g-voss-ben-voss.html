  <title>Gavriel and Giselle - D. G. Voss, Ben Voss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While watching the 2013 Moore, Oklahoma, tornado on live television, I shivered at what the town was facinga natural disaster of monumental destruction. As those dark and ominous clouds reached the school buildings, I asked myself, a former kindergarten teacher, the following two questions: Could I stay calm? Could I keep my students calm? The answer was a definite yes, but only with Gods help.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For days, my heart wanted to do something to comfort the whole community as they worked through their grief and emotions; yet, during that time, nothing extraordinary came to mind. While on a road trip a few weeks later, God revealed a story to me in a colorful movie format. After each vivid scene, I dictated the various events on my iPhone. When I arrived home, I transcribed the imaginative text and described the intriguing illustrations. Gavriel and Giselle came alive on the computer screen!&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May this story give comfort to children, parents, teachers, and communities, and to any survivor who has experienced a horrific event. If, after you read the book, you can smile and count your blessings, then my goal is achieved.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;God bless all the survivors!&lt;p&gt;" />
