  <title>Counters - Tony Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Warmones, hormones, and conscience compete for the souls of young pilots in the VietNam war. An air combat tale of whimsical intelligence and vivid realism.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its 1967 in DaNang, Vietnam, as new pilot &lt;b&gt;Steve Mylder&lt;/b&gt; reports for duty to his fighter squadron and meets fellow pilot &lt;b&gt;Avery Aughton&lt;/b&gt;. Avery is cocky, unbearably patriotic, and outrageously successful with women -- everything Steve is not! Yet they become friends as they drink together at the DOOM Club  bar and learn the ropes of air combat together. As they dogfight in the air, their mutual friend &lt;b&gt;Sub-Lieutenant Sam the Collie&lt;/b&gt; -- who thinks hes a fighter pilot too -- parallels their war by dogfighting on the ground against his rival Charlie, a junkyard mutt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve, unenthusiastic about the war, fights for his &lt;i&gt;life&lt;/i&gt; in the skies over North Vietnam but battles for his &lt;i&gt;soul &lt;/i&gt;against the Red Baron of his nightmares. Avery -- master of the art of combat seduction -- acquires a measure of humility as he thunders fifty feet over a North Vietnamese beach, looks down and locks eyes with an improbable bikini-clad woman  and falls into hopeless love. Both pilots seem on-track to survive their tours of duty when Avery is shot down and Steve has to face himself -- balancing imagination against reality -- in the aftermath of
a rescue attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Counters&lt;/i&gt;, former air force pilot Tony Taylor weaves whimsical humor and authentic details of air combat into a brooding yet fanciful tapestry, illuminating the hormones and &lt;i&gt;warmones&lt;/i&gt; that impel young men to war and stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
