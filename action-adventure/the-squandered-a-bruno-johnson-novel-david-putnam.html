  <title>The Squandered: A Bruno Johnson Novel - David Putnam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Squandered &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;propels Bruno into an emotionally charged high-speed chase as he and Marie leave their rescued kids in Costa Rica and risk returning to the U.S. at the request of Bruno&#39;s terminally ill father. Bruno&#39;s estranged and incarcerated brother needs Bruno to help rescue his abducted young grandchildren, children that Bruno hadn&#39;t known existed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bruno cannot deny his father, and Marie will not let Bruno go alone. As fugitives, they return to the U.S. to face not only imminent arrest, but also to confront ruthless kidnappers, drug dealers, and government agents who will stop at nothing to keep a secret from the past buried forever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glimpses of Bruno&#39;s law enforcement past shed light on the mayhem they encounter once they are discovered in L.A. It seems that Bruno&#39;s brother, Noble, has inadvertently kicked a hornet&#39;s nest of criminals, both in and out of prison, and among various law enforcement agencies looking to find a long missing load of nine million dollars&#39; worth of cocaine. And Noble&#39;s grandchildren are caught in the crosshairs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The chase, the brutality, and the emotional stress tests Bruno and Marie&#39;s relationship and forces them to define family-what&#39;s okay to forgive, and what should never be forgotten. Armed with a new moral code, will they live long enough to put it into practice? &lt;/p&gt;" />
