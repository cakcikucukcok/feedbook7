  <title>Arbor Lane - Elizabeth C. Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Twenty-one year-old Rosie Ross has graduated from college in 1955, and now prepares for a Catholic marriage. By the time she is thirty-three, she has had six children and is spiritually and emotionally fulfilled by caring for them full time, even though she senses her physical exhaustion. She also realizes she needs to get away from the husband who isolates and belittles her. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As the children become more self- reliant and independent, it opens the way for Rosie to think about her choices.  She receives a series of phone calls from her son in medical school encouraging her to think about becoming a doctor. As unlikely as it seems, Rosie recognizes it as a chance at a new life and a way to use the skills shes learned for the greater good.  Eventually, Rosie makes the decision that will change the lives of her and her family. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As Rosie follows her dream, the heartache of being separated from her family and her home take a cruel toll on her. Meanwhile, fate has intervened and the decision is now out of her hands and part of the great plan. &lt;/P&gt;
 &lt;/P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Arbor Lane&lt;/i&gt; is an American family saga, not only about Rosie Ross, but about the many courageous women like her, all over the world, who transform their lives daily by following their destinies, while they continue to be responsible to their obligations.&lt;/P&gt;" />
