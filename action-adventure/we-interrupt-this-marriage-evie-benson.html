  <title>We Interrupt This Marriage - Evie Benson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Loretta Walch finds herself single again, she takes her plus-sized dysfunction on a laugh-out-loud road trip towards karma. It&#39;s true the ink hasn&#39;t dried on the restraining order that taunts her in Chicago, but that doesn&#39;t stop her from making a very bad day for a small-town cop, a clueless veterinarian and a string of others who get in her way as she weaves and dodges hopefuls who&#39;d love to see her behind bars... &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; they can catch her.  &lt;br&gt;Left in Chicago, Frank Walch is given a second chance at happiness, but it comes with strings. He must deal with Aunt Edith, a woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to Elton John, a love of feather boas and anything bedazzled and a penchant for gossip that travels through the family tree faster than beetle kill.    &lt;br&gt;The question is, now that Frank has met Carrie Branson, a woman who more than makes up for his ex&#39;s toxic personality, will he be able to keep their romance alive when Loretta returns to Chicago to even the score?  &lt;br&gt;Throw a chicken in the crock pot and prepare to be entertained! &lt;i&gt;We Interrupt This Marriage&lt;/i&gt; is a fun dive into the deep end of dysfunction that&#39;s impossible to put down.    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Evie Benson lives on Alki Beach in Seattle, Washington where she enjoys beach-combing with her German Shepherd, Smalls, and supports her love of writing as a barista. &lt;i&gt;We Interrupt This Marriage&lt;/i&gt; is Evie&#39;s debut novel. Look for the sequel, &lt;i&gt;Frost Heaves&lt;/i&gt;, coming soon." />
