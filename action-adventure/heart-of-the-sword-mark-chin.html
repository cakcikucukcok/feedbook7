  <title>Heart of the Sword - Mark Chin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For almost three centuries, the Tokugawa Shogunate has held sway over Japan, bringing an unprecedented period of peace and political stability where once anarchy reigned. Yet all things must pass. As the world beyond its firmly-shut borders changes the restless nation stirs with the murmur of new ideas, like democracy, freedom, and industrialization.  
Some embrace the change that these words bring, while others will die to preserve the Old Order. The ancient samurai are caught in between. Among them is Saitou Hajime, a ferocious assassin, who lives by the power of his sword alone, and who will kill for duty and honor.
While engaged in a life or death brawl, he accidentally stabs a young woman named Tokio. They form an unexpected and mutual bond that includes a marriage of convenience that has no place for love. But nothing is simple in this time of upheaval. Both stand at the crossroads of history but share one destiny in a country aflame with passion and ambition." />
