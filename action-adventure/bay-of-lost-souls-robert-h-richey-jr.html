  <title>Bay of Lost Souls - Robert H. Richey Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stunned by a diagnosis of Cancer and forced to come to terms with the fragile nature of life, retired sniper Bobby Riley decides to delay surgery until after he takes his sailboat on a trip from Dana Point, California to Cabo san Lucas, Mexico to visit his best friend. 
 Unfortunately the vast Pacific Ocean can be capricious, dangerous, and unforgiving.  His boat is damaged in a collision with floating debris and he is forced to limp into a small Mexican port for repairs.  His peaceful world is torn asunder when he witnesses an assault on a woman and must fall back on his military training to affect her rescue, resulting in the deaths of her attackers.  
As they escape in his boat, he learns that the woman is the sister of Diego el Diablo Luna, the head of the most vicious, bloodthirsty, powerful drug cartel in all of Mexico, and she wants out.  Racing against time, he must negotiate a minefield of corrupt politicians, police and trained killers all paid for out of the incredible profits derived from narcotics trafficking to make good on his promise to get her out. He soon finds that everyone has their price; even the traitors in the US government who allow the poison into his country.  
Homeland Security, the DEA, and the Department of Justice all want the information that she has but are unwilling to upset the Mexican government to get her out.  He is forced to rely on his own combat skills, expertise as a sailor, and the friendships forged in battle as the journey aboard a top secret Stealth Sailboat leaves a trail of death and collateral damage from Baja to the jungles of Colombia and back to a final confrontation with el Diablo himself at the Bay of Lost Souls." />
