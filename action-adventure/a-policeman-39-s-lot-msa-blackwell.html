  <title>A Policeman&#39;s Lot - MSA Blackwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Policemans Lot
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Volume Two in the Notting Hill Trilogy
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A comedy adventure, beginning in London in the spring of 1975. An elderly widow who lived in Notting Hill and was involved in the finding of some stolen penny black stamps, brings home a real dinosaur bone to compare it to an imitation one. Her dog breaks the false bone and falls sick. 
A friend, who was visiting her, collected the residue contained within the false bone and gave it to a policeman. It was identified as heroin and investigations lead the police to Museums in England who had bought the false bones, being part of a display of Dinosaurs, to a raid in Holland, where the policeman, who took part in a raid, had a fight in a sex club. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The raid was a success, but his escapade in the club infuriated his superiors, whereupon he was placed on suspension. The chief constable, however, knew the truth and engaged him as an undercover agent to resolve other police matters and placed him with an American cop, as an assistant.
After many comical situations including going undercover in a nudist camp and being part of a sting in a  criminal situation, the truth, however, was finally revealed and the policeman became a hero and gained fame and fortune." />
