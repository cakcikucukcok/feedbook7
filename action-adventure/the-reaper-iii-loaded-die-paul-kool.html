  <title>The Reaper Iii: Loaded Die - Paul Kool</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After all the hardships chronicled in the second installment in the series, C.C. and the lads elect to take a year off to reflect and recharge. C.C. takes a vacation in Las Vegas and once there, decides to take up permanent residence and call it home. After a year apart Rizzo, Oscar, and Felix join him...and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C.C. and the boys soon find themselves handling some of the most important contracts of their carreer as professional assassins through an old friend that had vanished years earlier. The lads also finally get a chance to start their community service work cleaning up some of the garbage that has fallen through the cracks of the justice system.
This installment, possibly the last in the series, recounts and encapsulates the final years of C.Cs career and affirms his position as one of the most revered and feared professional assassins in the history of organized crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action is intense and C.Cs trademark wit abounds throughout; its a must read for Reaper fans that have enjoyed the two previous installments!&lt;/p&gt;" />
