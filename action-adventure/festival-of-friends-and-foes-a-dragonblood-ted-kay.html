Ethan, Camille and Jeremy plan on enjoying a fun weekend festival called Beltane with their families and other children with similar gifts.

Little did they know there was more thrills and chills waiting for them than they could have ever expected. Out witting giant animals, possessed assassins and curious kids, the three friends learn that they will all have to work together to make it out of this weekend without going crazy. If it weren&#39;t for their new friend Gretchen they would probably have been in a world of trouble with their parents too.&lt;/P&gt;" />
