  <title>The Splat Conspiracy - J Joseph Higgins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Being a 73 year old man who was raised during the great depression I have seen enormous changes in America. There has been dramatic changes in technology, human rights, political philosophy (and engineering) and social values. 
I have written a 75000 word story about a college professor named Adam Solomon who after winning a large sum of money, decides to initiate a bazaar plan designed to influence the national political agenda. Adams goal is to prevent any further erosion of wholesome morality and Americas constitutional liberties. 
To accomplish this Adam assemblies a group of highly skilled and experienced assassins. Their assignment is to surgically remove specific individuals who have become an unwelcome influence by endorsing ideas that are contrary to the American constitution.
After several dozen high profile killings a fire-storm ensues across the nation. On the one hand thousands cry for justice and a stop to the mayhem. Yet, others, the disenfranchised, the poor, the malcontents, neo-nazis and some various kooks applaud and support the activities. Some want to join up with and take part in Adams program. 
As the story builds the situation turns into a national crisis involving all of law enforcement and the President of the United States. 
During the crisis Adam finds himself drawn into a close relationship with the only female assassin. They have a brief sexual experience but,  Adam finally succumbs to the charms of his beautiful young secretary. 
A sub plot develops when a program supporter discovers the existence of an underworld child pornography ring centered in Guatemala. After much persuasion Adam and his team raid the Guatemala childrens camp freeing 200 enslaved children. They are sent to a Christian care center and later return to a normal life. 
Adam works through the plot with a good friend called the Captain. The Captain is a veteran of Desert Storm and though he has a dirty mouth he has a good heart and great military skills. Adams other good friend is a man they call Shakespear. He has a proclivity to speak using only lines that rhyme sometimes causing problems. Adam becomes friends with one of the assassins code named the Jackal. Hes very dangerous and useful.
The story ends with an unusual twist. Does Adam and his friends receive justice? Do they get captured? What will their punishment consist of?
Will Adam and his devoted secretary get married?
Could these event actually take place?
