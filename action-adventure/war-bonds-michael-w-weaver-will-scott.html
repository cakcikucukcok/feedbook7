With a cast of rich and likeable characters, the writers weave a tale of intrigue and suspense. This is the story of how two unlikely friends  Jack and Russ  thrown together during one of historys greatest battles  not only survive, but also live to collaborate yet again on an even greater endeavor.

Some of the discoveries they make and the dreams they dream confound them and us, the reader, but be patient. The surprise ending will be worth the wait!
