  <title>The Cruise of the Dazzler - Jack London</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Cruise of the Dazzler by Jack London.&lt;/b&gt; The Cruise of the Dazzler is an early novel by Jack London, set in his home city of San Francisco. It is considered a boy&amp;rsquo;s adventure novel. In the novel, Joe Bronson, dissatisfied with his dull life at school, runs away and joins the crew of a sloop he sees in San Francisco Bay. He finds the captain is involved in criminal activities. The nautical activities on board a sailing boat are authentically described, and there are convincing descriptions of boats enduring stormy weather at sea. Joe Bronson, instead of studying for a school exam, goes out kite-flying with his school friends; on their way back he gets involved in fights with gang members in a poor part of the city. After he fails the exam the next day, he walks out of school and takes a ferry across the bay to Oakland. Looking at the boats on the wharf, he imagines the exciting life on a boat. His father, a businessman, has a liberal attitude to his son; but, critical of his recent behavior and poor school report, tells him that he might send him to a military academy. Joe later leaves a farewell note for his family; returning to Oakland, he joins the crew of a sloop, the Dazzler. The captain Pete Le Maire is known as &amp;rdquo;French Pete&amp;rdquo;, and the one other crew member is &amp;lsquo;Frisco Kid, a boy of about Joe&amp;rsquo;s age." />
