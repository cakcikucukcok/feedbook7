  <title>Storm Wars! - Jon DeCles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Riding the Eye of the Hurricane, Piswyck, Lifesaver, and Miranda return to Carsonne, only to find the country torn by civil war.  The roads across the mountains remain closed, food is growing short, and the Countess has put an exorbitant price on Piswycks head.  Can the young Marquis unify his people,fight his way past abberant mythozooic monstrosities, and win against the dual armies of the corrupt tax collector Lomfroth and Kracmalnic the Mad?  Read on, in this highly-humorous, action-packed and long-awaited sequel to The Particolored Unicorn.&lt;P/&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;*****&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;I&gt;&lt;P&gt;Storm Wars thunders along in grand, exotic, picaresque style. The reader is swept up in the wake of the ludicrously entertaining adventures of the sexy young Marquis Piswick and his sardonic particolored unicorn, Lifesaver.&lt;P/&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Like most classical heroes Piswick has great flair, ingenuity and level-headedness, all of which he needs in a chaotic world fraught with deadly whimsicality. Its all about fighting, morality, mad invention, satire, blue wine and silliness. And monsters  of course  human and otherwise.&lt;P/&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Ive waited years for this book to come out. With a lot of modern fantasy being so drably serious, its bliss to have a cocktail like this: piquant with magic, frothing with romance, spiked with a salty wit.&lt;P/&gt;&lt;/I&gt;
