  <title>All of Yesterday&#39;s Tomorrows - Corey K. Cotta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was supposed to be a relaxing vacation. Even though he can&#39;t spend time in the warm waters of Belize, policeman Conrad Bishop is happy to spend time with his girlfriend, Amber, at a private beachfront home in Nantucket. After a tranquil evening walking the beach, Conrad wakes at 3:00 AM, turns on the television, and hears a disturbing news report about a deadly influenza plague-the direct result of a terrorist attack on the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rushing into his bedroom, he finds his girlfriend unconscious and suffering from a high fever. When he tries to take her to the hospital, the town is in a panic. Cars clog the road, and he&#39;s forced to return to the beach house. Amber never regains consciousness, and by that evening, she is dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grief stricken, Bishop is suddenly thrust into a world that changes by the minute. Terrorists attack every major city in the United States with car bombs and invade American embassies overseas. With a small group of survivors, Conrad struggles to stay alive. His fight will take him to the very steps of the White House and have him waging a valiant crusade to keep a dying nation alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
