  <title>Master of the Sweet Trade - Elizabeth Moisan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Set in the early 1700s, this fictional account of the pirate Samuel Bellamy chronicles his lust for gold; for the accused witch, Mariah Hallett; and for the treasure ship, the Whydah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam Bellamy&#39;s simple quest to find enough lost Spanish treasure to offer Mariah a secure future quickly becomes an insatiable desire for gold. For eighteen months he sails the Caribbean under the black flag, allowing this means to an end-this sweet trade of piracy-to claim him. In February, 1717, he seizes the Whydah, a slave ship returning to England with incredible riches in her hold. With more than enough plunder to line his pockets, he turns the Whydah north to Cape Cod and his greatest prize, Mariah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Sam is away, Mariah Hallett&#39;s secret is discovered and she is not only charged with murder, but faces accusations of witchcraft, as well. Confronting a harsh winter and an uncertain future, she struggles to survive alone on the rough Cape Cod moor that edges the sea. With unshakable faith that Sam will return to her, she walks the cliffs overlooking the wild Atlantic and watches for his ship.&lt;/p&gt;" />
