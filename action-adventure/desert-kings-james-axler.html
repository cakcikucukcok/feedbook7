  <title>Desert Kings - James Axler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;More than a century past the fiery dawn of post-nuclear America, Ryan Cawdor and his companions journey across a land lost yet reborn, where lawless violence and human perseverance clash, and unsolved mysteries hint at redemption. Though hope lingers under the blood and the dust, looking blindly toward the future is the surest way to get killed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Staying hard and cold for today is the only way to survive…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Traversing the terrain of Utah, Ryan Cawdor and his warrior survivalists find new evidence that the past is alive and dangerous–with a score to settle. Once before they&#39;d battled and destroyed the brilliant and cunning cyborg known as Delphi, but he&#39;s reborn and ready to continue his drive for domination. His vast understanding of preDark tech, his cadre of well-armed cutthroats and his legions of worshippers make him monstrous in his quest for power. And he&#39;s eager for the keys to the kingdom that only the legendary Deathlands survivors–and their secrets–can help him attain.&lt;/p&gt;
