  <title>Slice, Dice and Die - James Wyche</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Slice, Dice and Die is a sequel to Wyches first Novel, Onions Make You Fry and features the same cast of characters, but in different adventures in South Louisiana and Texas wherein Flint Malone finds himself up to his neck in hair-raising events that threaten his life and that of his side kick, Boo Worthy.  Flint and Boo again become Gator and Pepper, respectively assuming the personas of reprobate Louisiana alligator trappers as they squelch both a drug ring and the remnants of a satanic cult, also a carry-over from Onions.  
	Within the pages of Slice, Flint finds his soul mate who helps him solve the murders of his business partner, Lila and her husband, Dutch.  The intrigue of Flints escapades in the Attakapas Basin swamp of South Louisiana as Gator and in Lafayette, Louisiana as British oil tycoon, Harold Wintergarten, is exceeded only by his ardor for his soul mate, Sharon and devotion to his vocation as owner and head chef for his newly built, Gumbo You and his already successful catering business, It Dont Matter.  Flints culinary expertise was becoming legendary and yet his plans are constantly interrupted by his allegiance to a group simply called the Task Force, dedicated to the destruction of satanic cults in south Louisiana.
	Dive into this adventure and romance filled novel and follow the complex character of Flint Malone as he cooks his way through unbelievably dangerous events while at the same time finding the contentment and true love that he hopes will flavor the rest of his life.  You wont be disappointed.  I guarantee it!" />
