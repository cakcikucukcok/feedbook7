  <title>Unless You Are Silly - Roger Weatherly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Two young cousins discover they have jointly inherited a remote Scottish cottage with an intriguing history. They quickly learn what life was like there over a hundred years ago  but they discover even more about themselves, their families and the mysterious disappearance of both their fathers.  As they explore and share their own thoughts and emotions they realise their environment and the people in it have unexpected things to share with them.
Roger Weatherly has spent the last forty years as an educator, often letting the outdoors do its own education. He lives in west Cornwall. 
Roger says This adventure story has the momentum, excitement and pace which many young readers relish, but it also offers food for thought for readers of any age who recognise the impact a wilderness can have on young lives. Amidst the turmoil and humour, some of the big questions of life begin to surface. And what does Unless you are silly mean?
