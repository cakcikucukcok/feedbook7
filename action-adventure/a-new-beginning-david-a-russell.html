  <title>A New Beginning - David A Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its the late 1700s, and the settling of America is well underway. In this action-filled novel, a Polish immigrant is among the many settlers eager to make a new life in the new America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andraui Stanislaski, a survivor of the Cossack wars, is no stranger to danger. He is determined to find a perfect valley in which to settle down and live out his years in peace. His adventures carry him into the wild territories fraught with perils, illness, and death. Along his journey into the wilderness, Andraui rescues the son of a Native American chief and is invited to become a blood brother. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrauis generous nature drives him to help those less fortunate. He negotiates freedom for a group of slaves and a special indentured servant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he finds the perfect place to begin his new life, it is situated between two major Indian territories. Andraui carefully negotiates an agreement that benefits everyone. He must meet a tight timeline and keep many promises to ensure his Bright Valley becomes the perfect place for a new beginning for him, his new wife, Catherine, and the settlers who follow him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
