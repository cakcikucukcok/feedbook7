  <title>Two from Tennessee - Gary Lee Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="W.D. and Jesse, cousins from the back hills of Tennessee, head to Missouri &quot;just to pick some cotton&quot;. Swimming the Mississippi River and being caught in a hailstorm turns out to be the easiest part of their life-changing trip.
&lt;p&gt;
The old sea captain they find in a pool of blood aboard the Tiptonville ferry is alive, but barely! He&#39;s been robbed of a magnificent diamond necklace. As his life hangs in the balance, the sheriff treats the &lt;i&gt;Two From Tennessee&lt;/i&gt; like suspects.
&lt;p&gt;
They soon find work at the R.G. Billings&#39; Plantation, but get far more than they bargained for as a U.S. Air Force T-6 &quot;Texan&quot; crashes in the cotton field where they&#39;re working. Disregarding their own safety, they attempt a daring rescue of the trapped pilot.
&lt;p&gt;
In the meantime, Jesse falls head over heels in love with the sea captain&#39;s niece, Angel Steffelow, while W.D. gets involved with Kerri Lynn Carlisle, a young girl from New Madrid, Missouri who has psychic powers that intrigue and frighten him." />
