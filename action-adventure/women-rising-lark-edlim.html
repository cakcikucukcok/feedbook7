  <title>Women Rising - Lark Edlim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A victim herself, Courtney Stillwell founded the feminist magazine &lt;i&gt;Women Rising&lt;/i&gt; to create awareness about male violence. Every day in the world is a struggle between sexes, and her magazine tells all. It seems women must learn to deal with mens inherently aggressive nature because that nature cant be changed . . . or so Courtney believes, until she receives a call from one of her young writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronnie wants to submit an article for publication that will reveal some startling news. Rumor has it a new biochemical weapon has been developed by the US Army that, when added to the drinking water of enemy fighters, will render them unaggressive and unwilling to fight. The drug has been field-tested on a vicious motorcycle gang with surprising results. Apparently, the drug causes men to lose all interest in women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the promise of an end to male violence, Courtney braves the wrath of the US government by bringing to light this top secret program. Her decision ignites a chain of events that causes Courtney to relive her dark past and question the very basis of her beliefs about men. She is now torn between her devotion to the magazines mission and the desire to finally find a good man to love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
