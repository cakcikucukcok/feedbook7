  <title>Prisoner of Hope - Helen Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is based on a true story about a boy born into a poor and uneducated family in 1913.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young man felt unwanted, unloved and had hope for a better life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often feeling imprisoned by his circumstances, he remained hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sought to find answers about the existence of God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adults he questioned never gave him a satisfactory answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His life was full of physical, emotional and mental abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His journey to find hope led him to many adventures including a home with some bootleggers, a five-year stay as a deckhand and cook on a barge on the Mississippi River from the ages of 12-17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His suicide attempt was miraculously interrupted by a phone call .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will make you think. Sometimes it will bring tears to your eyes and other times make you laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a story of hope filled with tragedy and triumph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begins in a town on the Mississippi River and you will enjoy meeting the people in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be amazed at the events that transpire in his life from birth to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of his life, he was chesrished by many.&lt;/p&gt;" />
