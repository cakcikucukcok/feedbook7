  <title>Esau Jones Bounty Hunter - Jim Feazell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the spring of 1865, the war had ended, the president had been assassinated, reconstruction had began before the war ended and the border country of north and south was in a state of chaotic turmoil.&lt;p&gt;
Factions from both sides of the war had their lives up-heaved and destroyed beyond repair. Esau Jones was one of such men. He was only a teen-age boy when he rode as a renegade bushwhacker with William Quantrill causing havoc with Union sympathizers and Union troops. During these tumultuous times, guerrilla warfare still gripped the border country of Kansas and Missouri. Bitter conflicts ensued, bringing an escalating cycle of atrocities by both sides.&lt;p&gt;
As guerrilla warfare decreased more and more ex-guerrillas turned to outlawry for a living. Esaus friend, Jesse James, tried to get him to join him in banditry. Esau refused saying he wished to go west and find honest employment.&lt;p&gt;
Through a turn of fate Esau fell into the occupation of
bounty hunting. His reputation spread like wildfire among the outlaw element as the most feared bounty hunter of all time. Just to hear his name would cause one to quake in fear." />
