  <title>The Phoenix Affair - Paul Jr Marx</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Phoenix Affair
Centred around an expanding world population and the horryifying results of global warming. These pressures lead to individuals attempting to provide solutions. One of these decides to profit from his  own research. He has formed an organisation called Phoenix, which has a complex web of members from international governments , leading political and military circles. 
This individual is a world leading scientist but his activities come to the attention of MI6 headed by Howard Long. With his MI6  Howard Long enlists other lead members of the CIA and other international Intelligence organisations to help investigate Phoenix. As a result of what is found in China, MI6 has the key to the Phoenix organisation and its apparent aims. As a result, Phoenix and its  involvement with leading political figures across the world, is exposed .
It becomes clear to the CIA and MI6 that Phoenix, has to be stopped. This takes many actions, some unsuccessful. The organisation hits back hard on occasions!
Meetings take place between the Arab, US, British and Russian intelligence heads who organise various operations to try and stop Phoenix from achieving its world wide ambitions. The secondary objective is the capture of the Head of Phoenix and his team, who have all  vanished. 
During these actions a background event in Yellowstone is overshadowing many activities in the USA.  Eruptions and the contamination that results, is also commanding the attention of the US Government and its forces.
With the help of the international intelligence agencies, the CIA and MI6, try to formulate a solution to stop the Phoenix organisation and its objectives." />
