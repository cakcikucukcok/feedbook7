      &lt;p&gt;Henry Morgan is sent to England to stand trial for piracy on the High Seas, yet when news of his Sacking of Panama became general knowledge  Morgan became more popular than Drake.  Thoughts of his going to the Tower of London for any length of time soon forgotten, in due course Morgan returns to Jamaica by a grateful King Charles II.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    When the 3rd Dutch war breaks out; Morgan is knighted and made lieutenant governor of Jamaica, known as Captain Sir Henry Morgan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    King Charles II underlines their friendship by presenting Morgan with a silver snuffbox his image portrayed its perimeter encrusted with diamonds.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Morgan given Carte Blanche to begin his privateering again, providing he sends to England one-sixth of captured booty from Spains treasure fleets.  
Morgans pirate fleet continued to roam the seas around Maracaibo, Tortuga and Isle de la Vache near Hispaniola.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Morgan requests and is granted a pardon, to return to Tredegar castle in his homeland of Wales.  Despite Merrie Englands Good King Charlie dying 6th February 1685, a diligent clerk, unbeknownst to King James II, dispatches the document.  Kings man, DArcy Ingrams is ordered to recover it, as this could prove embarrassing to the new Catholic monarchs neighbours, France &amp; Spain.  Henry Morgan also deliberates whether to intervene in the forthcoming Protestant rebellion on behalf of James Scott, duke of Monmouth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Our adventure begins when a stagecoach holdup goes awry and the genuine pardon document goes missing for ransom
