  <title>Evolve - LaErtes Muldrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Im William Wineman, known as Wine-no Willie  The Kang of the Tenderloin! LaErtes asked me to say something bout the four tales in this book. The boy pays well so I say ok.&lt;br&gt;
COMPLEX  about a man named Pyriel who is hiding out from the government cause they want him and any like him for their Special Workshop; a tap into the powers of the mind thang. Pyriel chooses an apartment complex that is run amuck by bad ass kids. Once Pyriel realizes what hes gotten himself into he tries to help these brats and thats when hell breaks loose.&lt;br&gt;
THERMAL  this one messed with me. Its about a haunting, possession, voodoo, death, and conjured up demons. I killed a fifth of jack while reading this one.&lt;br&gt;
HARVESTER  which is the story I personally narrate  is about an Indian legend parents told their bad ass kids to make em mind, and what happened when that legend came to life.
NEED - this tale reaches past the Exotic-Erotic of the entertainment industry, and clear to blown away. Once youve read it youll take my meaning.&lt;br&gt;
I told LaErtes he should apologize to the readers for using vaguer language, the destruction of innocence, and the explicit sex and violence throughout the pages of this book.
The boy told me, Shut up - keep drinking my Jack Daniels. This book is about the salvation of the soul.&lt;br&gt;
The boy got a point there!&lt;/p&gt;" />
