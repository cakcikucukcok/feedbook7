  <title>Damian Garcia: Phd Drug Smuggler ~Book 2~ - Chris Mosquera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Damian Garcia: PhD Drug Smuggler
The story of Damian Garcia and the international drug trade in opium and hashish by PhD students in New York City began in 1972. 
They first met as financially hungry graduate students. They combined their expertise and intellect in business, chemistry, banking, and law to develop extremely discreet and enormously profitable global drug smuggling and money laundering enterprises. 
The financial returns exceeded their wildest imaginations, growing into the billions of dollars over time. They invested in social services helping those in need, legitimate businesses and global investments that continue to prosper. 
Money laundering is the back end of the international drug trade, and converting drug money into legal income is an expensive, complex, and dangerous process. 
The family believed that brains always prevailed over brawn. 
As business grew, they expanded their product lines to include the finest Thai marijuana and purest LSD-25 acid. They manufactured the Thai marijuana products into six-inch opium dipped strawberry flavored sticks and new Park Roads cigarettes. 
The group invented the process for converting concentrated liquid LSD-25 into premium Aspirin-Acid pills. 
Their clientele included professors, artists, politicians, doctors, lawyers, accountants, and elite professionals worldwide. Global sales skyrocketed. 
When we re-join the group in 1978, they have taken drug smuggling to the next level. Using the investor-franchisee business model, they developed their criminal organizations into multi-billion dollar international drug smuggling and money-laundering enterprises. 
The group owns and controls over 200 legitimate companies and financial institutions worldwide. Those that knew would never tell; that was the family code. This is the continuation of their remarkable success" />
