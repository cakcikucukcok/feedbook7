  <title>Albert’S Journey into the Universe - Iam Steward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alberts Journey into the Universe explores our garden universe in a playful manner that is fun for children of all ages. The story includes many of the elements that make for imaginative learning. The story takes the reader to places that we are not capable of going with our normal perspective paradigm but they are places also within our realm of possible evolution. Change your paradigm, change your reality. 
Meet critters that can communicate with man, go to the far reaches if the universe, travel around the world in a day, visit inner Earth, vision what our imagination can achieve, navigate through the micro and the macro universe, take inner journeys that lead you to source then go on a vision journey of your own. Envision a world where mankind is learning how to steward our spaceship Earth as well as our physical space suit that we are provided with from birth till death. Take a comical look at the possible blockages that keep us from achieving our full potential as a galactic species on a path towards source. Take a moment to imagine where mankind is destined to go giving divine blessing from within (our consent), from our connection with source. It is up to us. No one can do this for us; no government, no religion, no parent figure, no space aliens not even our ascended masters can make it happen. Yep; it is up to us. 
We may as well have fun making the desired changes, so have as much fun reading and imagining as you can." />
