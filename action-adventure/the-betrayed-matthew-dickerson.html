  <title>The Betrayed - Matthew Dickerson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The centuries-old war against the Daegmon Lord has been dormant for generations. Knowledge of the Giftsmystical powers of healing and shaping and knowledge, of speech with creatures, and of supernatural strength in battlehas faded into dim folklore, along with knowledge of the ancient enemy. When a Daegmon suddenly appears out of the old tales, and begins to wreak destruction on the remote villages of Gondisle, the realm is thrown into turmoil. Heroes of the land, led by a new generation of the Gifted, must arise and face this ancient enemy. But their situation grows more dire when the king not only refuses to give them aid, but proves to be under the influence of the Daegmon Lords servants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Book 2, Elynna and her companions continue pursuing the Daegmon in a desperate attempt to rescue the realm of Gondisle. The discovery of an old talisman offers a promise of power, and with it a new source of hope, but it also causes dissension within the company. Thimeon abandons the quest, choosing to return alone to the archives of Citadel in hopes of discovering some new knowledge that will aid them in the battle. While Elynna, now bereft of her Andani guide and hunter, must find a way to escape the armies of Citadel without giving up pursuit of the Daegmon. A wild chase leads Elynna and her company across the Plains and into the Undeani highlands where they find new allies, but also encounter new foes and betrayals, and discover that the Daegmon Lord is more powerful than they had ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work of epic fantasy, the second of three volumes, a group of Gifted heroes finds their quest disrupted by a talisman that brings both power and dissent.&lt;/p&gt;" />
