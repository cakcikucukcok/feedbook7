  <title>The Dome of the Guardians - Michael K. Andam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Kennymont, a small township in Felixburg County, the Muller family lived happily as highly respected, involved citizens within their suburban community. Blessed with a measurable amount of wealth and four children christened Janet, Magnus, Jason, and Katelyn, the parents worked hard to bring up their children within a moral frameworkteaching them by word and example, to eschew pride, and to cultivate love and respect for all, irrespective of status.
The second child, Magnus, was born with minor physical deformities but was strong-willed and loved adventure. His love for adventure, however, knew no bounds. At the age of eighteen, he ventured into the forbidden forest of virgin trees near his home. It was there in the shadow of the trees he was unexpectedly confronted with his foreordained destiny as the Wackidathe rescuer from evil in this millennium.
He is conditioned, taught about the plans of the great Creators in the universe known as the Supremos, and trained in his role as the sixth rescuer of man from evil since the time this planet was created. He is permitted, for the first time, to reveal to the world the role of his predecessors as he recounts his own assignments and his adventures in a series of thrilling episodes, starting with The Dome of the Guardians." />
