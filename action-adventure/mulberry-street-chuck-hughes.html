  <title>Mulberry Street - Chuck Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mulberry Street is the story of an aging man struggling to redeem failures of his past. He faces another when an early morning phone call summons him to his dying sisters bedside. Jenny has a last request, one that takes her brother back to the small Virginia town where they grew up. However, he does not know that while the journey to Waynesboro takes but a few hours, the road to redemption will take much longer. 
Ian arrives in Waynesboro to find that corrupt politicians and an old nemesis from his past have an iron grip on the town. Waynesboro is no longer the place of his childhood adventures and misadventures. 
Despite an accompaniment of unlikely allies, a historian, a librarian and a reluctant attorney, honoring his commitment to his sister appears hopeless. As Ian wanders between the challenges of the present and the tears and laughter of the past, he realizes that there is more at stake than his impossible quest. 
Set in a small town cradled in the Shenandoah Valley just a few miles north of Charlottesville, Mulberry Street blends historical truth with a healthy allocate of fiction to provide an insightful and entertaining glimpse into the struggles of one man. 
Hughes contends that everyone has a Mulberry Street tucked somewhere in the memories of their childhood. This is his." />
