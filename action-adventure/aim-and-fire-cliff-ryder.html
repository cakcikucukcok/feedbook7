        &lt;p&gt;ON ALERT…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A nuclear bomb has gone missing. At the same time Room 59, a covert unit of the International Intelligence Agency created to fight terrorist cells, intercepts a communiqu? from U.S. Border Patrol agent Nathaniel Spencer. A known terrorist, thought to be dead, is back in business.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;…AND UNDERCOVER&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tracy Wentworth is working for the Department of Homeland Security when she&#39;s contacted by Room 59 for an inside job. Aligned with Agent Spencer and backed up by Room 59&#39;s considerable resources, they are to assess and eliminate the threat, using any means necessary. But as they delve deeper into Mexico&#39;s criminal underworld, it soon becomes clear that someone is planning a massive attack against America…one that would render the entire nation completely defenseless!&lt;/p&gt;
