  <title>Chains of Whispers - Braxton Tyler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Samantha is a wealthy young girl who has lived a very sheltered life, having the very best of everything that money could possibly buy, but deep down she was unhappy. 
She may be rich and beautiful, but that didnt mean she had the respect and acceptance of her classmates at school. 
No matter how hard she may try ignoring Tiffany and her mean friends, these girls would not stop making fun of her, until Tiffany went too far with her games and Samantha felt very hurt and angry. 
Tiffany had her laugh and her fun, but Samantha will get even with her by creating her own game, Chains of Whispers. 
What started off as a fun game of making fun of Tiffany quickly spiraled out of her control as her made-up lies about Tiffany grew worse. 
Samantha thought she was in control of her own game, but she learnt very soon that making up untrue stories can really hurt Tiffany, but its too late! 
She was no longer in control of her nasty game; instead somebody was taking control of Samantha and the richest girl in town better do what shes being told . . . or everybody will know about Chains of Whispers!" />
