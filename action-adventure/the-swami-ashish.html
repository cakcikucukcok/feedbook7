What if the accident was caused due to his own mistakes? Sure he frantically remains disturbed. As an adult he wishes to fight for his answers. When grown up he wants to grope for the answers. When wise he intends understanding the answers. Now his intent is on the beyond - Let his fellow men not suffer like him. 
What happens if a society is subjected to similar phenomena? 
What happens if a nation suffers from such past? 
India represents the longest continuing civilization in the world. India represents the eastern thought the eastern mind. India has been subjected to abovementioned accidents. Swami Sad Chidananda lived to see them through. 
Many joined him driven to look for the answers to these perennial questions. Genuine questions only de-questioned them. Now the answers were not needed. The questions were not there anymore. 
Collectively they learnt that this was the universal human story. They experienced the development of the classical eastern mind and learnt that the classical western mind evolved too only to embrace each other." />
