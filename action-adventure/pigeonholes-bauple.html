&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The story of Joe Candide and how he realized the one thing that links all the unknowns in his life together
QUEENSLAND, Australia  (Release Date TBD)  Do you look at someone and automatically put them into a stereotype or pigeonhole? Joe Candide used to, when he was young. But as he matured, he began to realise that life and reality was a far more complex story. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Pigeonholes is a thought provoking book written by author Bauple.  It takes readers into the life story of Joe Candide, a man who is constantly changing his perspectives, job and lifestyle. But now, falling to his death from a seven storey building with his memories flashing right before his eyes, he reflects on his life and starts with each stereotype and then develops them into characters that are sometimes very different than his first impression. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Throughout his life, Joe had always thought he was in control of everything. He could read people, understand people, and know what they were thinking. He could work on the higher level with an empathetic view. But there were always subtle reactions and actions that took place now and then that he could not explain. Will he get the clarity that men search their whole life for? Will he finally realised the one thing that linked all the unknowns in his life together?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Pigeonholes will make readers realise that everyone has an immediate idea or first impression of people due to  their own prejudices.This book shows that rarely are the first impressions a true indication of character. It is witty and thought provoking and readers should see some part of themselves inside the pages. In the end, after all the raging against stereotypes and pigeonholes, Joe will finally find one that provides meaning and explanations and more importantly provides hope.
