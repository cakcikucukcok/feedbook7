  <title>Tip County - George V. Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When a mischievous little boy is born to a steel mill worker and a cafeteria lady, no one in Tippecanoe County has any idea that James Elroy Emerson will one day overcome his trailer park trash label and transform into a major political figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While on a coming-of-age journey that includes a foray into high school and college football, Roy is eventually kicked out of college and decides to follow in his fathers footsteps and enlist in the navy. After Roys journey leads him from Indiana to Vietnam to work as a combat medic, he becomes a war hero who adeptly treats injuries under enemy fire, marries a nurse, returns to college, and eventually enrolls in law school. But Roys goals include much more than the average law student as he sets his sights on eventually becoming Tippecanoe Countys prosecuting attorney. Will his dreams come true or will he stand in his own way once again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip County shares the fascinating tale of an ordinary mans journey into extraordinary circumstances as he overcomes obstacles, becomes a hero, and devotedly serves the people of Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;" />
