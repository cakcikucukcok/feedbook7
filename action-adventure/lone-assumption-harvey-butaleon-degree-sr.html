  <title>Lone Assumption - Harvey Butaleon Degree Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;OOSA Online Book Club gave 4 stars to: Lone Assumption by Harvey Butaleon Degree Sr.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Erik and his fellow Crime Dog gang members thought they hit the jackpot after car jacking a doctor for his vehicles. They made a nice sum of money selling the vehicles to the local chop shop. Little did the Crime Dogs know there was a dead body in the trunk. Now the chop shop wants the money that it paid out and the DA wants the Crime Dogs lives. The only problem is they arent guilty, despite the overwhelming evidence that says other wise.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This murder mystery lands on Detective Clyde Barrymans lap and it may very well be what he needs to snap him out of his alcoholic depression. Clyde desperately needs to prove the Crime Dogs innocence in order to restore his faith in mankind.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;Lone Assumption&quot; by Harvey Butaleon Degree Sr. is well written with very few grammatical errors. The story line flows nicely and had enough twists and turns to keep the reader engaged and flipping the pages for more.
