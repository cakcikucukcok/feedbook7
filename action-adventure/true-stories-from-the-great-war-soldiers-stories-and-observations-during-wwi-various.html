  <title>TRUE STORIES from the GREAT WAR - Soldiers Stories and Observations during WWI - Various</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book contains 18 true stories from soldiers about observations actions they were involved in during the Great War compiled from various sources by John Halsted, author and publisher. Here you will find stories like &amp;ldquo;The New St George&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;On the Anzac Trail&amp;rdquo;, &amp;quot;Todger Jones, V.C.&amp;rdquo; and the poignant, &amp;ldquo;Is that you mother&amp;rdquo; in which a German soldier was seen comforting a dying British Tommy, proving that even in the midst of such depravity there is yet some humanity left in the most hardened soldier.&lt;br /&gt;
