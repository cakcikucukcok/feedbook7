  <title>Papua: 1942–43 - Charles Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Papua New Guinea, Japanese forces occupy much of the eastern shoreline and have destroyed a vital radio station needed by the Allied Forces for navigation. Now, a daring mission by two soldiers to create a new station has gone terribly wrong. As one man hangs from his parachute in the dense jungle, he suffers from amnesia. In the midst of World War II, he has no idea he is.
After he is rescued by members of an indigenous tribe, Joe struggles to remember anything from his past. He meets a Japanese soldier who has gone AWOL, and Joe begins to wonder if he too is a soldier. Meanwhile, Mattie Billings, a newlywed living in Australia, patiently waits for any word about her husband, Rick, who is serving in the war. She has no idea that he is lost in a jungle with no recollection he is even married. Worse yet, the only one who knows what really happened in the skies above Papua New Guinea has been captured by the Japanese.
As three people separated by the travesty of war struggle to be reunited, each must look deep within for the answers in order to survive." />
