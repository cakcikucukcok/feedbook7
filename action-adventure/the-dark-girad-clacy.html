      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The sea, with its vast mysterious expanses has long been a source of endless fascination for man. Indeed, in the past piracy has also made a certain claim on our imaginations, with the idea of ruthless individuals roaming the world at will.

Take the sea, add a dash of modern-day piracy and toss in a horrible superweapon. Now you have the makings of a first rate, action thriller, &lt;I&gt;The Dark&lt;/I&gt;, by Girad Clacy. Well versed in seafaring lore, Mr. Clacy has crafted a modern day &lt;I&gt;Treasure Island&lt;/I&gt; that can stand up to any of the pirate yarns of yesteryear. With thrills aplenty, this novel will keep its readers on the edge of their seats until the last action-packed page.
