  <title>Migration—A Consequence of Color - J. Murray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the year 2049, a Venezuelan drug kingpin deliberately starts a conflict that threatens the soul of the United States by embroiling it in a civil race war, allowing him to gain more US territory and more clients. African American citizens are purposely pitted against whites in a tale of survival with only the kingpin coming out on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As racially motivated violence escalates throughout the country, there are few choices for Calvin Tobias Jackson, the second African American president of the United States, who is desperately searching for a way to ensure the survival of the nation and of its people. Among those who may offer help are a group of Special Forces soldiers outfitted with technology allowing them to vanish in any terrain; Kareem Toussaint, a teenage genius with an IQ higher than Einsteins; Jessica Walters, a reporter being swept up into the moral dilemma of reporting the truth as she sees it; Xavier Greyson, a billionaire businessman looking to protect his DC neighborhoods; and Stacy Williams, a single mother recovering from domestic abuse. But help may also be coming from an unlikely sourcethe Democratic Republic of the Congo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in the near future, this novel depicts a nation in the throes of civil race war as a handful of African American heroes work to end the violence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
