  <title>Alice - A.K. Albaari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Claire Woods had the friends, the looks, and the status. She was at the top of the social ladder at Summit View High School. At Summit View, everyone respected the laws of High School Hierarchy. Claire and her entourage dominated the game for as long as anyone could remember. Claire truly had it all, or so she thought. Suddenly the tides shifted, changing Claire from top girl to public enemy number one. Her fall from grace stripped her of her friends, her status, and her identity. But then Alice Monroe moved into town. Alice was everything but socially acceptable at Summit View. She was eccentric, tough, and witty. Her style is something between scene and emo; all of which is the exact opposite of Claire. But through a peculiar sequence of events the two become very close. And Alice gives Claire a solution to all of her social problems: kill the competition. Anyone who crossed Claire or simply got in her way became fair game for the murderous duo. But as the bodies pile up Claire loses herself in all the carnage. As her conscious slowly returns she begins question Alices true motives. Is she simply trying to help a friend or is there something else Alice isnt telling her? When will the havoc become too much for Claire? With a rollercoaster ride of a story and with a twist that will leave you stunned . . . to say the least, Alice is a raw, gritty, and exciting tale of loyalty, death, morality, and the loss of innocence." />
