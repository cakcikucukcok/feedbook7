  <title>Blood &amp; Roses - C. Edward Samuels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Blood &amp; Roses&quot; is a tale of unspeakable acts of murder, misguided religious fervor and abject avoidance of anything human. A joint services Anti-Terrorist Special Operations Unit is ruthlessly slaughtered in the endless wild forests of Gray&#39;s Harbor County, Washington. The only calling card left behind by some murderous hoard is a wreath of blood-stained white roses next to the shredded remains of Yankee heroes! A Deputy Sheriff with an interesting history is asked by the Navy Judge Advocate General&#39;s Office, with permission from the Penatagon, to handle the investigation. He, along with fellow law enforcement and military specialists, chase shadows from coast to coast. A virtual quagmire of wild-goose-chases; false leeds, miss-information, miss-direction, attempts on thier lives, close calls, near misses and outright blackmail leads to the formation of a super-secret unit. Working surepticiously for the CIA, the Tyche Factor
 (Tyche - Greek and Roman mythological term for &#39;luck&#39;) follows fantical fundamentalist Islamic Jihadists from the waters of the Willapa Bay, Washington, to the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, to the Pasayten Wilderness back in Washington State, to Canada, and to Puget Sound. Eventually, the Factor uncovers a diabolical sceme to kill our President; the Prime Minister of Canada, two pro football teams, and some 70,000 fans at the Universtiy of Washington. In the process, a SEAL Vice Admiral&#39;s daughter, a Navy Lieutenant Commander and Tyche Factor member, is kidnapped by al-Quada mujahideens. The story then takes the Tyche Factor into the fires of hell going after their fellow unit agent. 
This is a tale of exactly how the shadow world of field operations Intelligence assets function. It ain&#39;t pretty; however, it is pretty accurate." />
