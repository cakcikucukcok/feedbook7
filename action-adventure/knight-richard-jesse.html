  <title>Knight - Richard Jesse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Embark on an epic odyssey with Chase Forrester, an 18 year old boy forced to quickly become a man in a harsh and unforgiving world.  Set in a time that could very well be today, in a world rocked by thermonuclear war.
Chases father Jack is a highly trained sniper in the US military, and all he had ever wanted was to be just like him.  His father relents, and from a young age trains Chase how to survive in the wild.  As he grows older he will also teach him the many secrets of his deadly trade. 
After spending eight months in a bomb shelter, Chase will take his first step in the daunting 2600 mile trek from Hartford Alabama to Fairfield Idaho.  There he will hopefully find his father waiting for him at their familys cabin on Soldier Mountain.
He wont be making this harrowing journey alone, though.  Along the way he will meet a colourful cast of characters; and under tragic circumstances, one very special dog that he will raise from a pup.
In an endless struggle against man, animal, and nature, will Chase have what it takes to survive? To protect the ones he loves?  
Take the breathtaking journey, but be prepared to be emotionally exhausted by the time the book reaches its heart wrenching conclusion; one that will leave you wishing that the tale didnt have to end...but at least you will be able to stop holding your breath." />
