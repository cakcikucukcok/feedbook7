  <title>The Ozone Is Gone and so Went Racism - Isaiah Whitfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story began in 2015 in a country that is divided politically, socially, and economically. Sound familiar?   So consequently, the national government is paralyze to act on anything.  Suddenly the ozone depletion rates reached-a- critical level that allows a flood of ultraviolet light upon the planet causing millions of skin cancer deaths and suffering. The ultraviolet rays become so intense that it causes genetic mutations in newborn children. But what is unique about this man-made natural disaster is that it only affects people with lighter skin and people of European descent. The nature of the crisis forces people of European descent, people with lighter skin, and all the people of the world to re-examine long hailed prejudices regarding people with very dark skin. The ozone depletion crisis of death and great destruction becomes the instrument in which racism is addressed for once and for all. There is something mysterious about when humans go through death and destruction it seems to bring the very best out of humanity, more love, more caring for one another. Likewise, through the ozone crisis, a crisis that affects skin color becomes the catalysts in which racism is forever destroyed. See how the ozone depletion problem leads mankind to better racial understanding-and the brotherhood of-all mankind is boldly proclaimed in-all-his public discourses-as-a-result-of-the-crisis.  It is my most fervent hope that humanity will realize that we are truly- our brothers keeper:	May mankind be elevated to the highest level of consciousness without death and destruction forcing him in that direction. However, I fear that our time-as a specie, for- getting it right; is running out-IF-we continue to remain deaf to our higher ideals, that calls upon us to reflect the goodness of humanity under the best of social and environmental circumstances: then I fear intervention-by a higher power; -GOD, nature, or fate will surely confront us with some sort of catastrophe that will compel whatever goodness we have inside of-us, to come to the surface of our consciousness. We -must-not-wait for another catastrophe to force righteousness out of us. THIS- book, THE O zone is gone and so went racism, tells us a story about a time when disastrous-circumstances-forces mankind to elevate his RACE CONSCIENCOUSNESS-TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL.." />
