  <title>The Brexit Conspiracies - Dave Doran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; Alex Snark, an American &amp;eacute;migr&amp;eacute; and political consultant, the no holds barred protagonist, is the mastermind behind the winning of the UK referendum. He follows that success with a carefully chosen candidate for the Party leadership.&amp;nbsp; Scarlet Hogarth wins the day and they head for Downing Street where he becomes Chief of Staff in Number Ten.&amp;nbsp; Together, he and the prime minister carefully plot their initial contact with everyone from the civil service to the European bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the high pressure, high stakes, world facing Snark and the PM, the dangers they can see are like ice bergs, nine tenths hidden below the surface.&amp;nbsp; Corruption, ambition and financial intrigue are arrayed against Britain as it seeks to negotiate its exit from its decades&amp;rsquo; long union.&amp;nbsp; There is no help from old friends.&amp;nbsp; POTUS in D.C. is up for election and is unable to openly intervene in a disintegrating domestic and world order. The Downing Street team must negotiate its way through countless difficulties and face down a plethora of powerful forces as it plots a shock and awe solution to resolving the Brexit negotiations. Confusion, deception and conspiracy reign supreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brexit Conspiracies is a high concept novel of political intrigue.&amp;nbsp; The action swings from Downing Street to Brussels, from Canary Wharf to Basel and from Frankfurt to D.C.&amp;nbsp; In a fast paced story, set amid the Brexit crisis, various intergovernmental conspiracies and personal rivalries quickly surface.&amp;nbsp; A range of powerful world figures is determined that Britain&amp;rsquo;s exit will not be smooth.&amp;nbsp; The President of the EU has his eyes fixed on becoming President of France. A grouping of large European banks, backed by Russian oligarchs, is intent on eating Britain&amp;rsquo;s lunch by stealing its City base. Confusion and chaos reign supreme.&lt;/p&gt;" />
