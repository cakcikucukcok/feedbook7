  <title>Exile - Randall Cumley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I feel like I have been lied to&amp;rdquo; said Nathan. These were not the words you would expect to hear from a&lt;br /&gt;
successful businessman when asked about his plans for retirement. Through twenty five years as the&lt;br /&gt;
owner of a small business, Nathan had achieved the modern definition of a successful life. His home&lt;br /&gt;
and business shared space on a ten acre Colorado property. He owns a second home on the coast of&lt;br /&gt;
Florida where he keeps an expensive boat and all the gear to support his love of fishing. &amp;ldquo;They told me&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lsquo;he who owns the most toys wins,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve won anything.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Nathan had collided with the reality that the version of success presented by modern society is smoke&lt;br /&gt;
and mirrors designed to distract us all from the true purpose of life. The definition of success being sold&lt;br /&gt;
to our society is a lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Like Nathan, I had once been a business owner with cash flow, assets and opportunity yet I found myself&lt;br /&gt;
looking beyond all of that, longing for a deeper meaning from life. What should have been the pinnacle&lt;br /&gt;
of my personal success became instead a pivot point that turned my life to a new direction.&lt;br /&gt;
Through a small prayer, asking for understanding, I unknowingly opened a door that allowed God to&lt;br /&gt;
move me off of a Caribbean beach and into a modern wilderness where He changed both my definition&lt;br /&gt;
of success, and my understanding of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In order to save me from myself, God took me to exile.&lt;/p&gt;" />
