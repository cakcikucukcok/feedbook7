  <title>The Faithful Enemy - Varun H. Parmar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are eight friends. All of them united in childhood. The next thing they know, they have completed their studies and embark on a mission which they havent even thought of in their dreams. They face the gravest challenges of their life. A friend isnt with them, another friend dies and yet another friend disappears.  A helicopter, a shark, a ship, two planes, a lion and a bird, all explode. They are at the end of their wits. 
And yet another time, they find something which lead them into one of the most dangerous place which they had just read of in books. It is a game of life and death. Will they achieve their goal? Will they be successful? Will they come out of that  place alive? Who wins?
The mystery unfolds." />
