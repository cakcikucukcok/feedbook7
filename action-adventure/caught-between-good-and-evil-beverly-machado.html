  <title>Caught Between Good and Evil - Beverly Machado</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Both her parents, although they lived apart, lived behind the law. It had a lot to do with influencing her dream of becoming a police officer to help the victims of crime. With determination, her dream came true. But her dream to find a man that would love her seemed unreachable. It was on a trip to South America to visit her mother that she couldn&#39;t believe her eyes. Sitting there in her mother&#39;s apartment was the most breathtaking man she had ever seen. When she shook his hand, shivers went thru her body. He, in turn, couldn&#39;t take his eyes off of her. Love at first sight? Should she believe in such? When he found out what she did for a living, a police officer on drug patrol, it shook him up: but he knew he had to be careful that she did not find out what he did for a living. He had searched all his life for his dream woman and there before him, he was looking at her. After years of dating, she finally found out what he did for a living, and that the police and FBI were after him, she had to make a quick decision. The police work fast, the FBI work fast, the bounty hunter, Bloodhound, works fast, she had to decide what meant the most to her: her love or her job. She also had to decide fast." />
