  <title>Chitso Samake - Kenny J Moncrieff, Lowell Hildebrandt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a Steampunk Asian like world, there are those who gain the powers over specific elements such as wind, fire and things that aren&#39;t really elements like machine and death. These people are called Elementals who seek to gain wealth, fame and adventure and form guilds to strive to do so.
One of them, a water elemental, from the Ossuka Empire guild is named Chisto Samake. Accidently cursed by someone he loved years ago, he has the chance to fix thing and is assisted by a fellow guild member and friend named Genevive.
But being the only one known to have survived this curse, he is sought out by bounty hunters and mercenaries, who wish to collect him for experiments and collections. Obstructed by these, Chitso is helped by his willpower, skill and friends, the water elemental believes he will succeed." />
