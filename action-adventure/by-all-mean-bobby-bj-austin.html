  <title>By All Mean$ - Bobby &quot;Bj&quot; Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No one has dreams of being the best dope dealer, robber, or anything else of that nature. Well at least KB, BJ, and Nephew didnt until forced to the streets for whatever reasons of their own. All KB, BJ, Nephew, and their crews wanted were to have money, the baddest chicks, and respect on the streets; not realizing that fast money required some fast actions and eventually leading the street crews into blood wars. Get ready to follow the lives of three main characters as they do whatever they needed and wanted to do to get it By All Means. Who will be the street Kings once and for all? They never dreamed of being faced with the consequences of the lifestyles they lead; dead or locked up. I encourage you to use By All Means in a positive prospective and use it for what it is, a helpful tool to achieve a desired end. Do not allow this to alter you into thinking you have to go to the extremes of negative activities in order to possess those material things that you feel will secure a good life. Do not use By All Means as an escape route to do wrong because wrong will never be right. Use it as a motivational tool in doing something productive. Be a visionary and follow your dreams. By all means, do the best you can do and be the best at whatever you are doing. Think positive and in the end your means will be life, success, happiness, and longevity. On your mark, get set, GO!" />
