  <title>The Dare Pair - L.L. Scully</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I designed this series of books to address some of the problems that our children face in today&#39;s difficult world, after finding a lack of books while raising my son, that taught any lessons or dealt with any of the pertinent issues that our children deal with growing up. 
My hope is that this series will teach kids values and lessons in a way that they can relate to, with a bit of humor, and a good scary story. 
This first book touches on a number of subjects including, as the title suggests, first impressions or judging people by their looks, as well as teasing, name calling, friendship, and the consequences of not following the rules. Parents may wish to discuss these issues more in depth with your children, perhaps including some of your own ideas or morals in the conversation. 
Hopefully, by the end of each book, the reader will walk away with the subtle teachings in mind, to help see them through some of the difficult times faced by today&#39;s generation, or at least give them something to think about that relates to their own individual lives." />
