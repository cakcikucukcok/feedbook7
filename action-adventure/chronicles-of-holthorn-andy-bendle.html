  <title>Chronicles of Holthorn - Andy Bendle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Chronicles of Holthorn is a series of short stories that take place in a settlement originally known as Boarder Hold. In the story An Unwanted Change, a group of fizdicuns, ( a race I created that are avid wanderers, grow to be no taller than three feet, and have a natural habit of causing mischief and harm to members of other races) is imprisoned for past crimes, and is all about the changes the main character Javrin Colliroot goes through during his incarceration, and eventual escape once he becomes a goblin magus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donning the mask: this story starts six years after the beginning of An Unwanted Change. Its the story of Duke Nathan Holthorn, a young Mage warrior, and why he becomes a tyrant and changes the name of Boarder Hold to something that suits his vanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunate Beauty: this story starts four years after the end of Donning the mask. It is about a sixteen year old girl who is married off to a rich merchants son and goes to live with him in Holthorn City, once known as Boarder Hold the blossoming city. After a year of not being able to get her husbands attention, she seeks a way to free herself from the bonds of marriage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death for a Purse: this story takes place eighteen years after the end of Unfortunate Beauty. It is about a young thief who has lived in Holthorn city his whole life, and eventually has to leave all he knows to survive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus feature. The unknown Source. This story follows a twenty year old man named Jake, who learns that vampires are real, and also about the true source of their existence. Be warned, its a little erotic, and the main character lacks certain common morals and ethiics.&lt;/p&gt;" />
