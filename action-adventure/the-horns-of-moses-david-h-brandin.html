  <title>The Horns of Moses - David H. Brandin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David Green wants payback. It&#39;s been more than thirty years since his son, Aaron, was murdered by Arabs in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. And after the 2006 war in Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah, Green has abandoned all hope that the Israelis can defeat the Arab militants. Now it&#39;s 2007, and David is ready to avenge his son&#39;s death-on his own terms.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;David calls on his oldest group of friends, the Stony Island Gang, to help him execute Project Moses, his brazen plan to send terminally ill Jewish suicide bombers into Palestine and Lebanon to target one hundred Arab terrorists. Together, the men argue the moral implications of David&#39;s proposal. Echoing the centuries-old debate over the horns on Michelangelo&#39;s statue of Moses, they question whether murder is always unthinkable or sometimes justifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite misgivings, the gang puts Project Moses into action and begins the hunt for willing recruits. As their scheme takes shape, David and his friends cannot possibly know the chaos, suspicion, and international panic that are about to ensue.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Can murder and treachery possibly pave the road to peace?&lt;/p&gt;" />
