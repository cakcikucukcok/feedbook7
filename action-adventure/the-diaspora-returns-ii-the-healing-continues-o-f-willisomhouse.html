      <meta name="description" content="About the Book
The Diaspora Returns II, the Healing Continues is the fourth part of a fictional series that continues to trace the movement of this group of outcasts. After two and a half years of hiding out while performing their own investigation, the bureau have located their exiled location and the outlaw agent-group has been summoned by the bureau to return home to answer some questions about their private ten-year bounty hunting business. The focused questioning is on the death of one of the groups via internet security guards that the sub-agency hired for their families. The bureau believes that the outlaws have confiscated tapes and downloads that will help them solve other open and troubling cases. An unfair trade is about to take place between the group and the bureau in the form of information for leniency, on Slapps behalf. The ole Catholic Priest hasnt lost faith in the renegades as he continues to intercede for them with prayer and counseling. Personal relationships have been affected and now getting their lives back in order has finally reached to top of the priority board. There is another generation watching them, inside the bureau and at home. Continue to witness their enlightenment and healing process as they get their lives back on solid ground in The Diaspora Returns II, the Healing Continues Amen." />
