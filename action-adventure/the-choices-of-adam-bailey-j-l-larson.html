  <title>The Choices of Adam Bailey - J. L. Larson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1931, five individuals who met by happenstance one weekend in Glenwood, Minnesota secretly brought down a clandestine mob-run enterprise at a nearby remote lake resort. They wisely and determinedly stayed quiet about their success to thwart probable underworld reprisal; yet, in the months and years that followed they often were called upon to save each other from rumors and inquiries as to their possible involvement. They did so by whatever means or methods were required.
One of the conspirators, Adam Bailey, about to enter college at the time of the original mob bust, luckily faces little anxiety or threats compared to the others....that is, until graduation. Thats when his good fortune sours. He unexpectedly crosses paths with one of the key gangsters from that extraordinary incident four years before. The encounter leads Bailey to take on a job that requires international travel, particularly in Italy, France, and Switzerland. Through 1937 he builds a profitable clientele base until the war in Europe gradually depreciates his hard work. His experience, though, brings him a new opportunity....with the U.S. Defense Department ...to observe any military build-up in Italy as he carries out his regular business. The additional job carries seemingly only marginal risk until the spring of 1940 when he suddenly finds himself in a Milan, Italy jail ...the charges undefined.  Shortly, he realizes hes being framed. The  situation worsens and he escapes. In his quest to flee to France, he gets even deeper into his dilemma now having to outwit Italian and Swiss pursuers as well as those who framed him. Life and death choices are nonstop as he seeks his freedom.
In this third addition of the Minnesota Lake Series, the original story is once again enlarged showing how that chance meeting of those five  individuals years before...and the actions they took against the mob...  continues to have serious impact on not just Adam Bailey, but on all the lives of his fellow conspirators who defied the mob that weekend." />
