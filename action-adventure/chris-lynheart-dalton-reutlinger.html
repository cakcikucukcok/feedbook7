  <title>Chris Lynheart - Dalton Reutlinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Chris Lynheart takes place in Washington DC in the year 2020. It is the story of a fourteen-year-old boy who is mistreated, abused and lied to because of his mysterious past. Chris has one dream in his life. He has never seen his mother and knows nothing of his family or his past. His only dream is to meet his mother and hear her say I love you and his life will be complete. However, there are problems that change his fate. A new terrorist group rises from the Middle East and declares war on all NATO forces.  Europe, Asia, South America and North America are all threatened by this new terrorist force. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
WWIII begins and Chris finds out an important part of his past. He is a presumed failed military experiment and has the spirit of the Grim Reaper sealed within his body. And just to make things worse, the new terrorist brotherhood has created their own weapon. One that has been bred to destroy any enemy that opposes them. Will the Grim Reapers power to control the elements be enough to halt this rising threat? Or will the U.S government take advantage of Chris and destroy him emotionally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Inspired by Masashi Kishimotos Naruto and Naruto Shippuden Chris Lynheart will take your imagination to its limit.
