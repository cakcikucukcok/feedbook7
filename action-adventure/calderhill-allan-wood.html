  <title>Calderhill - Allan Wood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When you have nothing else to live for, you may have everything to die for. Detective Inspector Bob Buchanan reckons he has been touched by the hand of God. His life-long colleague and friend Detective Inspector Simon Ramsay, on the other hand, has nothing but evil in his desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle between good and evil comes to an explosive end as DI Buchanan sees a glimmer of hope, a light at the end of lifes dark tunnel. Choosing sides can be difficult, especially when the good are intent on inflicting evil and the evil can be harvested to provide all that is good. Decisions have to be made. Simon and Bob are pitched against each other in their personal vendetta against the community called Calderhill. A community steeped in centuries of tradition. A tradition of selective breeding and cannibalistic practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to death, there is no good way to go. When it comes to survival, any way will do. If a hand reaches out, grasp it, even if it is from beyond the grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the closing chapters of the trilogy that culminates as Calderhill.&lt;/p&gt;" />
