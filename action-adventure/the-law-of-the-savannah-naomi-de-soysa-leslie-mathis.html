  <title>The Law of the Savannah - Naomi De Soysa, Leslie Mathis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Here is the enchanting writing debut of a young author who, in her own creative style, could teach us adults a few lessons about the supremacy of love as a universal value and about the art of joyful living in the midst of everyday crises. As you take in Naomis imaginary world, you may never be able to guess the turns in the story that finally lead to contentment and joy.
What I find fascinating about this imaginary tale is that it does not follow the usual patterns expected in a story written by an 11-year-old. Happiness, sadness, joy, and sorrow are artfully interwoven into the lives of a herd of elephants, making the reader recognize that life within any community, whether human or elephant, may not be very different after all.
The Law of the Savannah is not the work of a child learning to write an interesting story; rather, it is the result of the stirring of a young writers consciousness  a writer who shows signs of awakening to the realities of life around her. I happen to be Naomis proud uncle and also her editor and have watched her creative talents develop as exemplified by the acclaim she has received for many of her previous articles and essays.
So relax and allow yourself to be captivated by this story, which will take you to many surprising and exotic places in the African savannah and bring you to the final conclusion  it is only love that really matters in life.
