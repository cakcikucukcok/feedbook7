On their journey to a mysterious place called the Forgotten Isle of Landing, Demetri begins to understand the truth of exactly &lt;i style=&quot;&quot;&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; he is as memories of another lifetime and another world begin to surface. His eyes fume with an ancient power as Demetris insidious tendencies impact his choices throughout the adventure and threaten to overcome his new found humanity. Demetri, with abilities spawned from hellish darkness and the ability to travel within the confines of his own &lt;em&gt;shadow&lt;/em&gt;, wages his own personal war against those he has come to hate most of all, those who would seek to use him as a pawn in their games&lt;i style=&quot;&quot;&gt;; the gods themselves.&lt;/i&gt; In the midst of his journey, Demetri is faced with a monumental choice; to travel back to his own world and escape the responsibilities charged to him by a being known as the Gatekeeper, as a &lt;i style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Champion of Balance&lt;/i&gt;, or risk his own &lt;i style=&quot;&quot;&gt;shadowed&lt;/i&gt; soul in order to save an enigmatic world where demonkind and humankind co-exist; a world he has come to call home.&lt;/span&gt;" />
