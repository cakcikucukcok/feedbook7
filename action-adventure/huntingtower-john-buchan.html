  <title>Huntingtower - John Buchan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;Huntingtower&amp;quot; is modern fairy-tale and a gripping adventure story by John Buchan, first published in 1922. It is the third of his three &lt;i&gt;Dickson McCunn books&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you only ever read one John Buchan book, it should be &amp;quot;Huntingtower&amp;quot;, which is a perfect introduction to Buchan&amp;#39;s body of work: it&amp;#39;s not too far out-there in terms of being a conventional story, but it also positively seethes with philosophical themes, and the trademark Buchan wit and &lt;i&gt;joie-de-vivre&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Huntingtower&amp;quot; tells the story of Dickson McCunn, a solid, respectable Edinburgh grocer who does duty on a Sunday as an elder down at the Guthrie Memorial Kirk. Mr McCunn is a businessman and a Scot, but he is also a born romantic. He loves the novels of Sir Walter Scott particularly and has spent his whole life dreaming, in a gentle sort of way, of finding Romance and having some brilliant, thrilling role to play on the stage of the world.&lt;br /&gt;
When Dickson retires from the grocery business and the good Mrs McCunn goes on holiday, he finally gets his chance to walk off in search of adventure and, supplied with a copy of &amp;quot;The Compleat Angler&amp;quot;, sets off across Scotland. His idyll is disturbed when he meets John Heritage, a Modern Poet, finding himself in the thick of a plot involving the kidnapping of a Russian princess, who is held prisoner in the rambling mansion, Huntingtower...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &amp;quot;Huntingtower&amp;quot;, Buchan introduces some of his best-loved characters and paints a remarkable picture of a man rejuvenated by joining much younger comrades in a fight against tyranny and fear." />
