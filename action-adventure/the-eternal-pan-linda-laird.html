  <title>The Eternal Pan - Linda Laird</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Years ago, I went to the movies to see Disneys Hook, starring Robin Williams as Pan. Although the movie was a wonderful story, I left dissatisfied with the idea that Peter Panthe boy who never grew upwas now a grown-up lawyer who was doomed to grow old and eventually pass on. He was no longer the eternal, immortal youth but just another human. It was a very disturbing thought because it took away the wonderful creation of Peter Pan as the eternal youth and ended the story, which should have gone on forever for all children or those of us that are children at heart. It bothered me that the boy who wouldnt grow up was no more. So I decided to add more to the tale to bring it back to its never-ending beginnings. This is the result.
Many thanks to those who put up with my crazy ideas and encouraged me to write them down, then read and assisted me with their input. To them and the spiritually youthful Robin Williams, I dedicate this story.
Tom Wilkerson, Paul Russell, Judy Orr, I couldnt have done it without them." />
