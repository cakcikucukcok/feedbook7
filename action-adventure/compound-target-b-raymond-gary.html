  <title>Compound Target - B. Raymond Gary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Homeland Defense is one of the most, if not THE most important issues of our time. Repeated and widely reported failures of our security have become almost too commonplace and Federal officials have conceded that another terrorist attack on our soil is almost inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
Now, B. Raymond Gary spotlights this issue with his all-too-possible, and very probable Novel, &lt;I&gt;Compound Target&lt;/I&gt;, a scenario of a terrorist attempt to deliver and detonate a device in a large city in the Nations Heartland. If successful, it will open the U.S. up to many more such attacks, as our security will have been proven ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;
A lone hunter in the Northwoods of Wisconsin is the sole witness to a terrible crime, and is unknowingly drawn into a pitched battle with the terrorists and the attempts by Federal and State law enforcement desperately trying to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;
This can&#39;t-put-it-down novel will keep you on the edge of your seat as the forces of the U.S. Government and the committed terrorists try to outwit each other, leading to a running battle in the center of the city.&lt;/p&gt;" />
