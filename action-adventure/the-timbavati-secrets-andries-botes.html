  <title>The Timbavati Secrets - Andries Botes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Timbavati Secrets explores the Pedi Dynasty, one of Africas lesser-known kingdoms. It is about the mysterious events that took place 180 years ago and how it affected the events that take place within the Timbavati half-moon, all the aircraft accidents in this small area, and makes you question, what was the cause of that fatal aircraft accident of former Mozambican president Samora Marcel? The book asks, From where did the Timbavati White Lions, discovered thirty years ago in this area, mysteriously appear? It questions the Rain Princess, with her meteorologist knowledge and her unquestioned ceremonies, claiming she cleanses the sky. What is her secret? And will this secret hidden so long affect you?
Visual realization: The tale of the Timbavati takes you into the east of Southern Africa, to the majestic Drakensberg mountain range that dissects South Africa. You will learn to revere the mountains and understand the influence they have on this harsh land. The action-packed tour takes you along the Rooi Lebombo Mountains forming the Timbavati half-moon, with the Timbavati River as its heart. The Timbavati is a mysterious place, and is part of the Kruger National Park. It is distinguished by huge, unusual rock formations, just outside Skukuza camp. The rollercoaster discovery tour of Africa on foot among wild animals creates a danger of its own, certainly not for the fainthearted." />
