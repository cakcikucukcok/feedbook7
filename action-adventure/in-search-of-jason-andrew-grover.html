  <title>In Search of Jason - Andrew Grover</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;IN SEARCH OF JASON is the story of Jason Reilly, a lowly employee at B.&lt;P&gt;Pictures, a cut-rate New York City film production company, whose owner, Mr.&lt;P&gt;B. is a confidante of many curious characters inhabiting both sides of the&lt;P&gt;law. In the course of one of his many errands for Mr. B., Jason goes to hand&lt;P&gt;some papers to a diplomat at the United Nations and in the course of his&lt;P&gt;time there, misplaces a film script he was carrying.&lt;P&gt;From that loss, dire consequences arise, for the film for which the script&lt;P&gt;was written was to have been shot in the Caribbean, with the production&lt;P&gt;serving as cover for a drug-courier operation run by one of Mr. B.s&lt;P&gt;less-than-legitimate pals, an underworld dynamo named Sicky.&lt;P&gt;In addition to his illegal interests, Sicky has entertained a lifelong&lt;P&gt;legitimate interest in some day becoming a major feature film producer.&lt;P&gt;Thus, the idea of someone like Jason not only endangering his profits, which&lt;P&gt;would be bad enough, but also imperiling his cinematic opportunity of a&lt;P&gt;lifetime is an outrage to which the only answer can be one of summary&lt;P&gt;execution!&lt;P&gt;Now, its one thing when youre seeking to prove your innocence to a law&lt;P&gt;officer who, theoretically, is subject to some constraints, but when youre&lt;P&gt;trying to explain yourself to a paranoid gunman who acknowledges no laws&lt;P&gt;save those in his own, options become more limited. Such is the case for&lt;P&gt;Jason.&lt;P&gt;So, after narrowly avoiding being murdered in his bed and getting run over&lt;P&gt;by a speeding car aimed at a pay phone booth hes calling from, Jason makes&lt;P&gt;his escape from the city. He heads for the New Jersey Turnpike, Chesapeake&lt;P&gt;Bay, Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, the Florida swamps, Miami and,&lt;P&gt;finally, the Caribbeans blue carpet.&lt;P&gt;Along he way, he picks up a partner in crime - or perhaps innocence. Dr. Sam&lt;P&gt;Albert is a former 1960s college revolutionary, present-day psychiatrist and&lt;P&gt;off-hours bush pilot, whose set of wings Jason finds useful in Miami, when&lt;P&gt;the ships captain hes hired to take him afloat begins to cause problems.&lt;P&gt;Later, while island-hopping in the Caribbean with Albert, Jason gets,&lt;P&gt;unwittingly, another partner in the form of Aringapu, a Central American&lt;P&gt;Indian whose ancestors, 500 years earlier, were either massacred or driven&lt;P&gt;off the very island where Sicky now proposes to set up his supreme shoot.&lt;P&gt;You wouldnt expect Jason to come to earth practically right under Sickys&lt;P&gt;Ray-Bans. Youd think it would be the last place Aringapu would want to turn&lt;P&gt;up in, too. Youd think, above all, that the good Dr. Albert, skilled in&lt;P&gt;providing wise counsel and comfort, would look out for Jasons interests and&lt;P&gt;fly him out at once. Youd be wrong on all counts, particularly on the last!&lt;P&gt;You might also expect, on this page, to find out how it all wraps up, but&lt;P&gt;this place is meant to stimulate your appetite, not satiate it. All that can&lt;P&gt;be said for now is that, in a curious and appropriate way, the punishment&lt;P&gt;fits the crime.&lt;/P&gt;" />
