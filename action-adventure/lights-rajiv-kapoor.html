  <title>Lights - Rajiv Kapoor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Vera Lights is a former Broadway star whose life has taken a new direction. Now a single mother living in a hotel in midtown Manhattan with her two young children, Henry and Loretta, Vera does her best to protect and nurture them, despite her meager resources. Alone after failed marriages and with seemingly no hope for a career revival, she must rely on her inner strength to carry her through her exhausting days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Vera works as a waitress in a Broadway diner to make ends meet, Henry and Loretta grow up in a dark, challenging world in which vagrants, pimps and drug dealers own the street corners, police turn a blind eye, and tourists avoid Times Square. But as life comes full circle and a resurrection of Broadway and midtown Manhattan begins, Vera and her children may be able to rise from the depths of despair and breathe life back into their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lights&lt;/i&gt; is a poignant, sweeping story of revival as a Broadway actress attempts to restore her hope, faith, and separate destinies for her family while living in a city marked by hate, ignorance, and poverty.&lt;/p&gt;" />
