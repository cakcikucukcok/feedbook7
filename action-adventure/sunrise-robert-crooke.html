  <title>Sunrise - Robert Crooke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Sunrise&lt;/I&gt; is a tale of illusion, loss and renewal in a tragic age. Set in
Manhattan, and in the fashionable beach towns of Long Island&#39;s East
End, it follows the interwoven lives of three friends from the late
1960s to the present-exploring the confluence of art, commerce,
politics and celebrity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With its perfectly rendered physical setting, &lt;i&gt;Sunrise&lt;/I&gt; draws readers into
the reality of place and the universality of myth in a daring, Modernist
style.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Stephen Dahl, the narrator of &lt;i&gt;Sunrise&lt;/I&gt;, is a troubled child of the 60s,
an expatriate American author living in Paris, an alcoholic who has
stopped drinking but failed to recover his spiritual equilibrium.
Watching the horrors of September 11th from his Paris apartment, he
is struck by renewed patriotism which vanishes quickly as America
plans to invade Iraq. But he is called home in the Spring of 2003 by
the death of his former best friend and by the chance to see his former
lover, the widow of his old friend. Thus begins Stephen&#39;s journey to a
past that reveals complex layers of moral and spiritual responsibility
to his country, his countrymen and himself. Stephen confronts an
uncertain future by accepting the moral limits of despair and the
power of compassion." />
