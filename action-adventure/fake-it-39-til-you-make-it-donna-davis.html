She didnt look anything like them, and she had absolutely no personality traits in common with them eitherand they never let her forget it. That is why she was so happy when she met and married Al Butler and became a part of his family. They were the family she wished she had been born into. That is until Al was killed in a tragic accident and her Mother-in-Law, Irene Butler, blamed her for his deathand promptly cut her off.&lt;/p&gt;
