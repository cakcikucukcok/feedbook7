  <title>When Worlds Collide - Gino Gammaldi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was inspired by Ginos avid interest in science fiction from a very early age. He has a firm belief in the existence of extraterrestrial life. The two main characters from his earlier book, The Secret at St. Marys, are reunited in this story. They are transformed into their alter egos who take us on a journey of goodwill and intrigue in sectors of the universe yet unchartered. In this book, we experience the thrill of travelling to strange new worlds and meeting aliens that are like nothing ever before encountered. 
There are the Sebemos of the planet Xulud. They have a body that looks like rough stone and are shaped like a long macaroni noodle. There are six spindly-like tentacles around their bodies, and they have a face that resembles a computer chip. Their leader is Gray Munchkin.
There are the Gubeiggas of the planet Esile. They are almost like humans, but with pointy heads and wings. They are quite good-looking. Their leader is Queen Becca.
There are the Cyclopzorgs of the planet Ocat, who want to change the way the Sebemos and the Gubeiggas live. They have bodies that are half-bear and half-giraffe. 
There are the Brainoids of the planet Barbabeetle, who are very wise and want to help Omsoc and Etnorb. This race looks like beautiful sunflowers, with faces that have some humanlike characteristics. Their leader is Onigiul. The immortal, wise one is Aznagarb.
There is also the aspiration of new hope for peace and harmony among those who seek this. Our two travelers achieve what seems to be the impossible, against all odds and great danger to themselves." />
