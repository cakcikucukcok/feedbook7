  <title>Radiance  a Mallory O&#39;shaughnessy Novel - Paula Rae Wallace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In RADIANCE, Mallory finds the Lord ever faithful as she pushes ahead with her diamonds and design business, partnering with Diana Faulkner. David is never far from her thoughts as the five years pass, sometimes seeming to crawl and, at other times, racing by. With her equilibrium thrown off temporarily by the entrance of handsome Cy Warrington, it isnt easy for her to get back on track and live down the failure. Can the Lord give her victory and the desires of her heart? Can she keep her companies profitable and embrace the relationships the Lord has placed in her life? It seems like a lot for one so young. As her friends announce engagements and rush to the marriage altar, can she resist being caught up in the mad dash? Read Radiance and experience what the blessing of the Lord can accomplish with a surrendered life.
