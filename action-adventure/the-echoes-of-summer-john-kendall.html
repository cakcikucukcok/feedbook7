  <title>The Echoes of Summer - John Kendall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1956, and although Jonathon Statler is barely fifteen, he is already a proven survivor. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Locked in a world of loneliness and abuse, Jonathon has nonetheless managed to learn golf and tennis, and embrace a levelheaded approach to life. He has paid a price, however. He is grossly overweight and short on self confidence. His eyes are more often on the tops of his sneakers than level with the world around him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until one magical summer when Jonathon meets Malcolm Platt, the Director of Robert Morris Camp for Boys, and Angus McClatchy, a former teacher who now considers himself nothing more than an old man and, finally, a sensitive young woman named Becky Wilson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Echoes of Summer&lt;/I&gt; is set against a background of racial and religious tension so prevalent during the 1950s. Author John Kendall captures the interaction of youth and age that provides the catalyst for a story that lifts the spirit and makes it soar.&lt;/p&gt;" />
