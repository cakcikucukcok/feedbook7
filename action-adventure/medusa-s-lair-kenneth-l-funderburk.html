  <title>Medusa’S Lair - Kenneth L. Funderburk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Chic Sparks is a clinical psychologist, famous tenor, and part-time investigator. After his beautiful, red-headed girlfriend, Suzy, convinces him to pursue a search for his former friend, notorious crime boss Ken Renfroe, he is soon pulled into the heart of a criminal enterprise that stretches from silk stalking bankers in Boston to the charismatic underworld leaders of the Sinaloa Mexican cartel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a wild sea battle between two warring Mexican drug cartels ensues, Chic must navigate through constant conflict as he penetrates deeper into a dark world and searches for clues he hopes will lead him to Renfroe. After he uncovers a money laundering operation infusing billions of dollars of drug money into the world economy, the lair is revealed as bloody conflicts between the cartels come to a head in an ultimate battle for domination. Now only time will tell if Chic can escape the lair, bring the truth to light, and complete his mission to find Renfroe before it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this gripping tale, a modern day crime fighter on a quest to find a crime boss uncovers an international money laundering enterprise that places him in grave danger.&lt;/p&gt;" />
