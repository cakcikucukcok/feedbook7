  <title>Shadow over the Caribbean - Dr. Joshua David Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book continues with the adventures of Briggs Chester as his employer and friend, Dan Mallory, again hand him a complex and dangerous assignment.  As Briggs is vacationing on Key Biscayne, a small and wealthy enclave just miles from downtown Miami, Dan arranges a meeting in Miami to discuss a special assignment.  At the same time, on the Caribbean Island of Aruba, a Cuban Intelligence officer, Major Ramon Garcia, is approaching a beautiful agent of Cuba, Monique Von Steuban, to undertake a sensitive operation for the Cuban Intelligence Service.  This operation, initiated at the direct order of Fidel Castro, will involve money, love, and cocaine.  The Miami-Cuban National Federation, in Miami, has been aware that the Cuban Government had been stockpiling massive quantities of cocaine in Cuba which was being held as a reserve much like other Nations stockpiled gold.  Their intent is to use Briggs Chester to convince the Cuban Government that he is a drug dealer with one hundred millions dollars available to purchase cocaine.  The Cuban government, in dire need of hard currency will put together a plan to sell Chester the cocaine for his money.  Fidel will take direct charge of the operation which will take place on a island in the Bahama chain.  A fast moving story that culminates in the middle of a hurricane on the small Caribbean Island of Great Inagua." />
