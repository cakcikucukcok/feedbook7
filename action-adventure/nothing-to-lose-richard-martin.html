  <title>Nothing to Lose - Richard Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Michael Stone thinks hes an experienced consultant. But when hes sent to investigate a case of corruption in South Africa involving a government minister whose department manages national roads projects, hes thrown into a world of conspiracy and intrigue. While hes ploughing through official documents, he becomes aware of another storm brewing: the threatened demolition of Alexandra (home to more than 350,000 poor people in the heart of South Africas most expensive real estate) with the intention of turning it into executive housing. The residents resistance to demolition is met by arson and violence, but behind it all is the one and same minister, who happens also to be chairman of the developers. Michaels sympathies draw him to the protestors, and he offers to share his Greenpeace skills as an activist to help their cause. Before long, there are threats to his life, and he has to go into hiding. Meanwhile, his efforts to help the residents struggle are slow to bear fruit, and his motives for helping them are questioned. Suspicions flare, and his life is threatened by the same people he is trying to help. One thing is sure: it will end badly." />
