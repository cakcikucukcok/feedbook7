  <title>Separation - James Axler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Hard strength and resilience are needed to survive each new day in the treacherous world of post nuclear America.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For Ryan Cawdor and his companions, honour, integrity and a willingness to kill are necessary as well, as they struggle to balance a survivalist spirit with a warrior&#39;s resolve to press on, living by their own rules in a tortured land, pursuing a dream that leads them into the unknown….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ryan and his group make their way to a remote island in hopes of finding brief sanctuary. Instead, they are captured by an isolated tribe of descendants of African slaves from pre-Civil War days. When the tribesmen declare Mildred Wyeth &quot;free&quot; from her white masters, it is a twist of fate that ultimately leads the battle hardened medic to question where her true loyalties lie. Will she side with Ryan, J. B. Dix and those with whom she has forged a bond of trust and friendship…or with the people of her own blood? But the loss of Mildred is not the only threat the group faces–in a treacherous world where the ties that bind can cut both ways. In the Deathlands, the future is not what it used to be….&lt;/p&gt;
