  <title>To Find Friends - Deryck Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After making a career change, he is now disillusioned with life and longs to go back and meet with some friends in the defence force. These four friends are in an elite air force group and the fact that he tries to trace them unravels into a spy novel. He also meets a lady and falls madly in love. The novel moves between the action and the romance reflecting the two personas of the main character.
In his efforts to find his friends, he is drawn back into a special forces unit to assist them to uncover a spy network. During this time, he works with a team of permanent force specialists, one of which is a female. In the act of assisting them, they uncover the depth of the spy ring when one of their own team turns out to be a double agent.
The special forces task team leaders wife is kidnapped, and the leader is blackmailed only to have his wife liberated before too much harm could be done. Then finally when the task is complete, the spy ring smashed, and everyone is being debriefed, the main character goes back to his hotel room only to be surprised!" />
