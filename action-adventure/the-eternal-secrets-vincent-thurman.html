      <meta name="description" content="Mysterious, fascinating, and amazing elements of the supernatural 
Sebastian Kane lost his soul many centuries ago. Decades later, he lost the love of his life. There are rumors that he may be able to reincarnate her with the all-powerful Book of Spells. Sebastians secret is that hes a vampire, and his only purpose in life is to discover and solve the elusive clues to find the book. On his return to Haven-Crest after his last venture, he meets a very unique young girl named Jenessa Craig, an aspiring senior in high school. As chance would have it, she harbors a secret also: shes living out a prophecy of a legend foretold by a powerful dympyre, a vampire and howler hybrid. Jenessa begins to doubt her sanity and lose trust in people around her. As shady individuals with deadly intentions show their hands and more secrets start to unravel, the clock ticks in the race against time to find the Book of Spells. The ultimate question is: Who can be trusted?" />
