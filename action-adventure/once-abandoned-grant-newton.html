  <title>Once Abandoned - Grant Newton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Grant Newton, born 1984, is from Maumee, Ohio (just outside of Toledo) and a 2009 graduate from Ohio University with a B.A. in Creative Writing. During his final years there, he began to get serious about writing short stories and poems about his experiences in and around Athens. For instance, he saw the value in playing poker all night with the locals, driving and exploring the surrounding areas, and the element of frontier and lawlessness in the town. It was difficult to focus the attention he desired on his short stories (although hed compiled pages of ideas) and, after talking with a few distinguished English professors, decided instead to write a full-length novel. It was a challenge to balance it with the pursuit of a degree, but in October of 2009 he completed a fictional adventure book entitled In The Sights. With its release, he hoped to fund other projects such as an intricate short story collection (with the many references from his novel included) and multiple film projects.
In February of 2011, he comprised these short works and poetry into one body: Once Abandoned. It can be read simultaneously with In The Sights or on its own, but is sure to captivate readers both young and old alike." />
