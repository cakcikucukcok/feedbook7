  <title>Attack of the Koto Maru - Alan De Wolfe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;	Greed had always driven Prince Ranar of the Pacific nation of Moolong.  He recently acquired the technology to build nuclear weapons on his other island, the fortress island of Catena, while many miles to the south in the same chain, the peaceful residents of Timano Island kept a secret no intelligence agency had ever guessed.  From the close of WW II to this day, the Japanese sailors who had intermarried with the simple people of Timano had cloaked an amazing ship.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;	Meanwhile, the abduction of the Pentagons Susan Black right off the Washington beltway had complicated Lt. Mark Ingrams problem of having to find certain atomic detonators stolen from a government repository.  His &quot;vacation&quot; in the same island chain soon got him acquainted with Paul Stevens, an ex-Wall Street broker-now-beachcomber and Naoki Matsumoto of the Timano Island inhabitants.  With the liberated Susan Black, the four prove too much for Prince Ranars dream of world conquest.&lt;/P&gt;
