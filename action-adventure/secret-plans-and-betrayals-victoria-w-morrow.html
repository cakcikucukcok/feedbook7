  <title>Secret Plans and Betrayals - Victoria W. Morrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is about powerful wizards, sorceress, and others in a quest to stop a fateful war that might end up in the destruction between two realms. A secret group of wizards, mages, and a golden dragon come up with a plan to save them all.&lt;/br&gt;
	After overcoming many challenges; they can only hope their plan will work.  With a war waiting and an evil wizard waiting in the darkness who wants it all and along his side is the castles concubine; who wants to be Queen.&lt;/br&gt;
	But, there is hope in involving which breaks the delicate balance of magickal codes of all natural ancestral history.&lt;/br&gt;
	With new creatures, plans and secrets they all still have their own demons and battles to fight.&lt;/br&gt;
	I wrote this book for those who want a story of magickal tales, with daring mystical battles between good and evil, and how the power of love can save kingdoms from cataclysmic ends. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt; Secret Plans and Betrayals Book Two: Is for a reader interested in tales of magick adventures, daring mystical battles, between the forces of good and evil, and how the power of love can save Kingdoms from cataclysmic ends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You can kiss many frogs and never find your prince except in books.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
