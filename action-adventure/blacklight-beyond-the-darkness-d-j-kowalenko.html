  <title>Blacklight: Beyond the Darkness - D.J. Kowalenko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jason Rain is just a normal guy living a normal life when he attends the grand opening of Cosmic City, a massive superbuilding in Alberta, Canada. Little does he know that just two hours later he will be tied up in a cave with his brother, Brody, along with many others, held captive by a psychopath and his cronies. With Brodys help, Jason escapes, along with another captive named Kara and a dog they call Sullivanbut Jasons life will never be the same again.
The trio soon find themselves in a world gone mad. With zombies in hot pursuit, Jason must rely on instinctive skills and strength in order to survive. He must find a way to defend himself against the undead, stop Snake from carrying out his evil plan, help Kara uncover her family history, and escape with his life.
In this tale of action and adventure, a young hero must search for answers in an apocalyptic world corrupted by lies, secrets, and death. Now only time will tell if he will find what he is looking for before it is too late for everyone. He must uncover the truth behind the outbreak that would later become known as the Cosmic City Incident." />
