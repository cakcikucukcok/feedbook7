  <title>Danny Malloy, Samurai on Pawselin Prairie - M. A. Hugger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After spending three years at the Hamm School and Farm for Juveniles, Danny Malloy is ready to go back and live with his mom. But first, his probation officer tells him, he must make a go of it with the Nowells, his fifth foster family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, Danny is tempted to run away, but he discovers that Mrs. Nowell makes the best pepperoni pizza. He begins to find his way at the Nowellss home, which sits on the edge of a river bank overlooking the Mississippi River in southeastern Minnesota. His goals are to keep his faithful pet, Dog, and to find a girlfriend. Along the way, he makes lasting friendships and finds exciting adventures, like playing volleyball on Party Hill in the middle of the Mississippi River, stalking a bear in a corn field, and catching deer poachers on a no moon night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in the style of Mark Twain, &lt;i&gt;Danny Malloy, Samurai on Pawselin Prairie&lt;/i&gt; narrates Dannys coming-of-age story that includes his experiences of love and heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;" />
