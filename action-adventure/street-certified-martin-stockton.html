  <title>Street Certified - Martin Stockton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;It&#39;s a life to be envied and desired, filled with private jets, millions of dollars, and tons of cocaine. It is also a life many would kill for-literally.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;After paying his debt to society, Kilo fights to reclaim his place in that life. Fresh out of prison, he&#39;s back on the streets as lethal as ever. As the number one drug lord, he is the head of one of the most notorious cocaine and heroin operations in America. Kilo&#39;s power and wealth surpasses even that of Q, a man who is feared by all. But Q is much more than Kilo&#39;s rival-he is also the father of Tina, Kilo&#39;s beautiful half-African American, half-Colombian fiancee.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Desperate to protect his place and power, Q coerces Derrick, a lethal, young fifth-degree black belt into becoming an enforcer in his empire. Now, no one is safe. Derrick quickly builds his reputation by kicking ass from Baltimore to Philly to Virginia. Just as quickly, his honesty, loyalty, and respect earn Q&#39;s loyalty in return-and this brings him no small amount of animosity from the other drug lords. Big R, Q&#39;s right-hand man, has put his new rival in his sights. Can both survive in this bloody society?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Spanning decades tainted by murder, deception, lies, and greed, Street Certified continues the saga of Hustler&#39;s Greed.&lt;/P&gt;" />
