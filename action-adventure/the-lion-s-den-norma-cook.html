  <title>The Lion’S Den - Norma Cook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Della Rawlins has seen much during her adventurous career as a photojournalistbut nothing like what she just witnessed in Abbottabad, Pakistan. While on assignment for Today magazine, Dellas partner, Aaron, was beaten and captured during a helicopter raid on Osama bin Ladens compound. Somehow she managed to escape, but now she has no idea where Aaron is being held or if he is even still alive.
After deciding she needs time to regroup, Della takes a photographic assignment in the Canadian wilderness. But it is not long before her solitude is invaded by Brad Jamieson, a wildlife conservationist who wants to protect her from the dangerous world of foreign politics. While Della longs to leave political intrigue behind and start a new life, she is unfortunately shackled to the past by a secret that has placed her in the crosshairs of a vicious enemy. Now she must rely on courage and determination to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds and fight for her countrys integrity and her own freedom.
In this action-adventure romance, a photojournalist and a conservationist embark on an international journey to the truth as lives, hearts, and the future of a presidency hang in the balance.
Carving out a new niche in contemporary romance, the author draws you into the violent world of Middle Eastern politics that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
