  <title>Celestial Mesa: 2012 - Sharon S. Delaney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="So, for centuries your people have worked as farmers and hunters, knowing the future would roll down to the end days prophecied by the Mayan culture like a run-away freight train? Sue asked.
Yes, it is true, Frank replied.  We didnt have much choice, we had to keep body and soul together until the end days.  We rocked along for centuries working in the fields and hunting.  We domesticated fowl, eating their meat and eggs.  We were all small communities and lived in simple dwellings that were relatively easy to repair.  If we suffered natural disasters like earthquakes and tornadoes that destroyed our homes, we cleared away the rubble and started over.  
Then we came up on the twentieth century and everything got different.  We went through a surge of creating new inventions.  We learned to fly and made electricity, toilets that flushed, fancy cell phones and the internet.  Suddenly there wasnt anything happening on the planet we didnt know about.  Weve become complacent now, and a hundred years after the inventions came, our fancy inventions are beginning to crumble.  
We got so we depended on the economy.  The monetary system took over.  Men became greedy and pulled and tugged at the proceeds from Wall Street until it all began to unravel.   
They created bigger and better weapons  not where you had your enemy in your sights, but you could take out whole cities at a time.  The Hopi tell in their prophecies of villages in metal and glass canyons, where a man could walk all day and never see the horizon.  One day someone would push a button and where a city had been there would just be steam. The people would have no choice but to just walk away  if they survived.  We are getting to be like the Olmecs and Mayans and Aztecs who couldnt feed their people because their population and their cities got too big, and they had to abandon them.  Its not impossible New York could become an abandoned city.  It could happen.  They could just walk away.
In the twentieth century, for the first time skirmishes became world wars.  The young men left the land their forefathers defended and went to lose their blood and their lives defending someone elses land.
One day soon we will lose all our fancy toys to the end of the age of electricity and technology and succumb to sunspots that will devastate communications.  Our forefathers never knew sunspots existed." />
