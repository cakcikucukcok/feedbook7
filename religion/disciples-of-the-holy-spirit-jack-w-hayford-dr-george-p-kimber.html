  <title>Disciples of the Holy Spirit - Jack W. Hayford, Dr. George P. Kimber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;Jesus gives the Holy Spirit to make people his followers and to guide them as disciples. Disciples of the Holy Spirit helps Christians to understand the work of the Holy Spirit, to clarify the role of the Spirit in their lives as believers, and to guide them along moral paths so they may embrace the Spirits gifts and bear fruit to the glory of God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;Author George P. Kimber taps his knowledge and experience from nearly six decades of discipleship as an evangelist, pastor, teacher, and professor to explain the gifts and fruits of the Holy Spirit. He outlines Gods need for disciples in todays challenging times. He tells how the Holy Spirit empowers individuals to follow Jesus unique model of discipleship. He describes the ethics of discipleship that Jesus taught in his Sermon on the Mount and that his apostles carried out in their ministries. He reinforces the truth that godly love underlies all of the Holy Spirits work in the lives of disciples.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;Disciples of the Holy Spirit will guide you both in understanding how the Holy Spirits gifts and fruits come to life in your discipleship and in applying moral principles to the faithful practice of the Spirits gifts. In the end, you will come to know the Holy Spirit and its holistic work in your life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
