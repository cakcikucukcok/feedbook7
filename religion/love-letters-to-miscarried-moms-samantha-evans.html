  <title>Love Letters to Miscarried Moms - Samantha Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The word miscarriage, in today&#39;s culture, is a dirty wordrarely discussed and grossly misunderstood. Yet, one out of four pregnancies ends in this tragedy. Where are these women, Samantha wondered, after her miscarriage? Slowly, quietly, women began to approach her, but, Ive had a miscarriage too, was all they could offer. Samantha realized that she had unwittingly become a member in an underground, secret society of women who suffer alone in silence. 
&lt;i&gt;Love Letters&lt;/i&gt; is the story of her journey, the same journey that each mother who miscarries begrudgingly embarks onthe excitement of pregnancy, the overwhelming, unfathomable devastation and loss, the grotesque details that no one speaks of, the uphill road toward hope and freedomand the Savior who walks beside her every step of the way. 
Though she stumbles, she will not fall, for the Lord upholds her with His right hand (Psalm 37:24)." />
