  <title>A Gift From God - J.D. James A. Gauthier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God created Eve from Adam&amp;#39;s rib. Did God create Hayden from Ian and Eli? The young pregnant mother appeared and said, &amp;quot;I am here to deliver this child.&amp;quot; Ian delivered her baby, but she died instantly when anesthesia was administered. DNA established that the young woman was a hermaphrodite. Biblical angels are hermaphrodites. Her body was sent to the morgue, and later requests were made to return the body for further DNA testing&amp;#39; but the young woman was gone leaving behind her surgical gown. The child she delivered was the mirror image of Ian &amp;amp; Eli. Hayden shares an equal IQ, blood chemistry and DNA with her adoptive parents. Her heart beats in unison with her adoptive parents and she has many of the gifts possessed by her mother. The DNA verifies that Hayden is &amp;quot;Of her parents&amp;quot; and not &amp;quot;From her parents.&amp;quot; To be &amp;quot;of&amp;quot; means to be created in the likeness of the parents as Eve was created from Adam by God. Read this book and see God&amp;#39;s hand in Hayden&amp;#39;s creation and reflect on God&amp;#39;s promise to be with Hayden always.&lt;/p&gt;" />
