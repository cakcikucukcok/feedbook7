  <title>From the Cradle to the Cross - Lennox Anthony Blaides</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;From the Cradle to the Cross From the Grave to the Sky&lt;/B&gt; is a book about the life and Times of the Lord Jesus Christ as he walked the earth more than two thousand years ago.  There are four specific areas in this study that make up the foundation for this book.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;B&gt;Phase One&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt; deals with prophecies concerning the birth and reign of Jesus and the circumstances that surround his life as a child.  The bible does not elaborate on the first twelve years of his life so there is reason to believe that his life was that of a normal child.&lt;/P&gt;  
&lt;P&gt;What is important to note is that Matthew gave a genealogy of Jesus; not only to show his lineage to David, but more importantly to demonstrate that he was not begotten by anyone but the Holy Ghost.&lt;/P&gt;  
&lt;P&gt;Matthew chapter 1 verses 1-17 speaks of the lineage of Jesus but verses 18-23 speaks of his conception by the Holy Ghost.  This is extremely important for him to be called the Son of God.  Since Jesus was conceived by the Holy Ghost and he is called the Son of God, it is reasonable to say that the Holy Ghost is God.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;B&gt;Phase Two&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt; goes a little deeper as we follow his footsteps from the river Jordan where he was baptized by John the Baptist; to a place called Calvary where he would be crucified. Jesus himself prophesied of his own death.  Matthew 20 verses 18-19 Jesus said, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;B&gt;Phase Three&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt; will take us into the grave where the tell-tale signs of his return would be discovered.  There would also be witnesses in the grave who testified about his resurrection. We will discuss the significance of the empty tomb and what it means to the believer. There is more on the resurrection and the disappearance of Jesus for eight days.&lt;/P&gt;  
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;B&gt;Phase Four&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt; captures the disciples looking up into the sky because the Saviour of the world, the King of glory was on his way to heaven.  There are several incidents that took place from the time he was placed in the grave to the moment he was taken up into the sky; all of which are instrumental to the faith of the believer.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this phase, Jesus speaks of the love that we ought to have for the brethren.  In the gospel of John, he gave us a new commandment that we should love one another as he loved us. (John 13 verse 34)  This was before his death, but after his death, he brought the subject back to the surface and spoke of the two aspects of Love; namely, agapao and phileo.&lt;/P&gt;  
&lt;P&gt;There is a reason behind all that is written in this book. The Apostle John wrote, All these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.&lt;/P&gt;" />
