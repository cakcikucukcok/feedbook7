  <title>Life Is but a  Dream - Tracy C. Lutz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Within the pages of this book, you will find some of the most inspiring information available in an easy, readable format. This book will take you on a scientific and spiritual journey at the same time. Today is the yesterday you prayed for tomorrow. In life, we say there are no do-overs. Who knows that to be entirely true? Open your mind and soften your heart for an adventure that will shake the very core of your foundational beliefs. Since birth, I have known God on some level. In the midst of everything I have observed on this planet not just the reality of a supreme being but also the reality of God himself, I cannot recall a moment during this incarnation that I was not aware of him. The soul of a man is absolute. It cannot die. In some form, it will live on. So buckle up and prepare to experience another dimension of life!" />
