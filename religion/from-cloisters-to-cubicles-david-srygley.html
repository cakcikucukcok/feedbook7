  <title>From Cloisters to Cubicles - David Srygley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many have tried; many have failed. Spiritual disciplines, meant to strengthen and encourage Christian living, have become a source of frustration and disillusionment for many Christians. Many of the books available are steeped in mysticism, monasticism, and non-biblical language. It doesnt take long for a Christian to begin thinking spiritual disciplines are so heavenly focused that they are no earthly good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Cloisters to Cubicles redefines spirituality, spiritual disciplines, and Christian maturity in such a way that any Christian can understand, practice, and grow through the practice of spiritual disciplines. Instead of spiritual disciplines being focused on strengthening just the spiritual dimension of life, they become exercises that strengthen ones everyday walk with God in this world. To accomplish this goal, spiritual disciplines must be understood as exercises in the reintegration of faith and life. They should help Christians appraise all things as spiritual beings (1 Cor. 2:15) and take every thought captive to the obedience of Christ (2 Cor. 10:5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Cloisters to Cubicles helps Christians bring the strength and guidance of the Holy Spirit back into their daily lives. Christians can live in this world with all the power and wisdom meant for them as citizens of the kingdom of God. Christians really can have the kingdom life now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a beginner it will give you a place to start. If you have already progressed from milk to meat it will provide a map for spiritual growth that can keep you absorbed for a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
