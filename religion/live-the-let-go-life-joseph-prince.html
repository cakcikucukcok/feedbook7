  <title>Live the Let-Go Life - Joseph Prince</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;Are You Overwhelmed by Stress, Worry, and Anxiety?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unending daily to-do lists. The frantic pace of modern living. The race to stay relevant in the face of disruption. The very real threat of superbugs and terror in our everyday lives... It&#39;s not hard to see why so many people today are experiencing stress, worry, and anxiety attacks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, these aren&#39;t simply innocent states of emotion-they can insidiously develop into chronic depression and psychosomatic illnesses, and lead to destructive behaviors. But here&#39;s the good news: While stress is depleting and debilitating, it can be defeated and driven from your life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In LIVE THE LET-GO LIFE, Joseph Prince shows you how to beat stress and anxieties that come with the everyday demands and pressures of modern living. Discover how you were not designed by God to live under stress, but called to live the life of rest. You will learn how to let go of stress and see His grace flow unabated in the worry-free areas of your life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
