  <title>Transforming Yourself - Sheena Coates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transforming Yourself &lt;/em&gt;is a devotional, motivational, and inspirational book. It is designed to uplift your spirits, give you drive and encouragement, and motivate change in your life. It will push you to love yourself, stay strong and confident in yourself, and never give up. If you keep fighting the good fight and change the way that you think about situations, you will get through any obstacle that may arise in your life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transforming Yourself &lt;/em&gt;is also designed to show you how to stay obedient to God (Jesus), humble, and positive. Prayer is important, and so is believing in yourself and your abilities. &lt;em&gt;Transforming Yourself&lt;/em&gt; tells you to always keep your faith, never give up hope, and stand firm. Do not fear the negativity that may arise against you, be who you are, and do not lose your uniqueness. When you fall down, get back up and try again, and always keep love alive. There are different chapters in this book that you may be able to relate to, you have gone through, or you are going through similar situations.&lt;em&gt; Transforming Yourself&lt;/em&gt; is solely to transition your mindset and to see things differently and in a positive light.&lt;/p&gt;" />
