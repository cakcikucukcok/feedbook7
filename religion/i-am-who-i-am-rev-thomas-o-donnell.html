  <title>I Am Who I Am - Rev. Thomas O’Donnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Said God to Moses, &quot;I am who I am.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Ever since, questions about God abound.  Who, what, where, when,  why?  Even, how many?  In the Christian faith tradition, what about all that &quot;trinitarian&quot; stuff  the Father, the Son, the Holy Sprit?  Is it one God?  Three Gods?  What&#39;s up?  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	I AM WHO I AM is God&#39;s answer to all these questions and more.  For the first time ever, God speaks out.  The God of the Holy Spirit, the immanent God inside, speaks out!   And all is good.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	I AM WHO I AM is God&#39;s answer to all these questions and more.  For the first time ever, God speaks out.  By overthrowing the hierarchical Trinity (with the Father enjoying a view from the top and the Holy Spirit bringing up the rear) and by replacing it with a circular Trinity having no beginning and no end, for the first time ever, God is free to speak God&#39;s mind.  The God of the Holy Spirit, the immanent God inside, speaks out!  And all is good.   
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	The book is divided into six Parts (as we all know, on the seventh, God rests).  After a general introduction in Part I, Parts II  IV are devoted to each persona of the Trinity offering thoughts on anything and everything:  on Creation and the Creative Process;  on the &quot;mind of God;&quot;  on the need for an &quot;extreme make-over&quot; when it comes to God and the Holy Trinity in contemporary society;  on the universality of the story of Jesus;  and so much more.  Speaking to the reader in no-nonsense, user-friendly terms, Part V addresses such theological topics as &quot;The Prayer of the Preyer,&quot; &quot;S.I.N.,&quot; Satan, Heaven, Hell, and everything in between.   The final part, the Epilogue, is a return of that talking donkey out of the Book of Number&#39;s, Balaam&#39;s Donkey, reporting from the parade route of Jesus into Jerusalem.  It is something that no one should miss.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Finally, an autobiography of God as seen through the lens of God! 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Finally, the God of the Holy Spirit gets his/her say!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And all is good.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(I AM WHO I AM  is the first of three autobiographies featuring God, Satan, and Jesus, respectively.  Stay tuned for Satan&#39;s personal story in E-MAILS FROM THE UNDERWORLD and for I AM THE WORD:  AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JESUS.)" />
