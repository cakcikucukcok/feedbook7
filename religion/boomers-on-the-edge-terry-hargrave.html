  <title>Boomers on the Edge - Terry Hargrave</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Where can you go when you’ve been pushed to the edge?The baby boomer generation has found itself in a perfect storm of new and difficult challenges. Aging parents need care. Adult children are moving back home. And just when boomers thought they could retire, economic realities such as meager 401(k) plans and crushing medical expenses are forcing boomers by the thousands back into the workplace. As a boomer, you will have to face at least one of these situations and perhaps even juggle all three. Boomers on the Edge explores the unique challenges that lie ahead and shows how you can survive and even flourish. This book is filled with practical advice, and it is also rich in encouragement. Author Terry Hargrave helps you see the opportunities behind today’s changing circumstances. Now is a new chance to build a legacy of wisdom and connection with your parents, learn new responsibility as a parent to older children, and deepen your faith in the face of financial realities. By embracing the emerging landscape of tests and changes, you will discover the rewards of developing a servant’s heart, and you will come to see God’s faithfulness as never before." />
