  <title>A Journey of Faith: Lessons Learned in the Fire - Heather McCormick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life is a journey that includes laughter and also tears. It is sometimes a voyage of questions and doubts, but it can be a journey of faith. In this personal narrative and devotional, author Heather McCormick tells her story of facing infertility, caregiving, grief, and other challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Journey of Faith openly shares her emotions, questions, doubts, and struggles, but it also records the faithfulness of God along this unexpected journey and the wisdom He taught her through the fires. Of the lessons that she shares, some teach about Gods faithfulness, His goodness, His comfort, His healing, His presence, His perfect timing, His sovereignty, and His answers to prayers. Others focus on faith, forgiveness, grace, love, humility, grief, laughter, peace, and spiritual warfare.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In A Journey of Faith, McCormick communicates that God is at work in the problems you face. He is with you always and uses the problems to teach you. She shows the importance of continuing on the faith journey and learning to walk by faith with God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
