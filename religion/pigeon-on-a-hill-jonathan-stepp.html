  <title>Pigeon on a Hill - Jonathan Stepp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt, it is first and foremost the story of Jonathans journey battling cancer. But perhaps even more, it is a book of lessons. Lessons in &lt;br /&gt;
Hope, and the power it has to change minds and hearts.&lt;br /&gt;
Friendship, and what is means to care for others.&lt;br /&gt;
Joy, and the obstacles it can overcome.&lt;br /&gt;
Trust, because, after all, the doctors need lots of it.&lt;br /&gt;
Faith, and the miracles God can work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel privileged to have played even a small role in the story. The view I was afforded makes me certain that those characteristics are not only true of the book, but that all involved with Jonathan from 2008 to 2009 felt part of them too. Praise God!&lt;/p&gt;" />
