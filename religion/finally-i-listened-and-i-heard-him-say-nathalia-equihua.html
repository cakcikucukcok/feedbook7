  <title>Finally I Listened and I Heard Him Say... - Nathalia Equihua</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Enclosed is a collection of love letters, inspired by the Holy Spirit, reminding us of Gods promises written in the Bible. The readings speak of His everlasting love for us. They speak of the love, peace, and joy that He wishes to fill us with. You are drawn up close and personal with our heavenly Fatherexactly where He wants you to be. The messages will warm your heart and comfort your soul. Come, read, and be blessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 2:17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Having gifts differing according to the grace that is given us, let us use them; if prophecy, let us prophesy in proportion to our faith.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Romans 12:6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 14:13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above scriptures speak to my only qualifications to share the words written in this book. I am not a theologian or minister of any church only an obedient servant of God. These love letters from God, written from 19812013, assure us of His love for us and the peace and joy that He longs to fill us with.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Chicago, Illinois is my homeland. I was born, educated and raised my family there. I also lived in Indiana, Nevada, and now Texas. Each of my four children and grandchildren live in different states. I am a retired widow and enjoy traveling to visit each of them. It was my pleasure to teach primary children for thirty-seven years. It was a joy to learn from them, for as God said, Assuredly I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of God (Matthew 18:3). I pray that my aged outer self never penetrates my childlike heart. Being retired has given me the time to put in print a lot of what our Lord has spoken to me. I know that you will be blessed with this and future books.&lt;/p&gt;" />
