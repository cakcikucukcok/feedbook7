  <title>Never Alone - Sayif M. Sanyika</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the things I learned on this thousand-mile walk is I am only vulnerable when I hide and, I hide when I feel threatened, not up to the challenge, or I am ashamed about something. Also, I realized as humans, most of us are always host to at least one if not all three conditions that invest heavily in our sense of guilt, shame and fear.  These conditions exist greatly because of the ill will that we have projected and invested in the image of our own creation, not understanding the power we put into such an investment, nor do many of us have the spiritual understanding of the spoken and unspoken word, and its internal and external power over our thought processes as well as our behavior. On the other hand, I believe with positivism one can disinvest in all ones negativity.  One cannot do harm to ones neighbor without doing harm to ones own character, self-esteem, emotional and mental stability; ones own sense of self is diminished.  Let us step out of fear and free the heart; free the heart and step into the power of ones eternal-self and you are, once again, walking in humanity, in spirit, reflecting the loving image of Spirit, not the confusion we have placed upon such a concept." />
