  <title>Unconditional Love and Faith Observed - Bill Belknap</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many Christian believers experienced a time in their lives when their faith was not strong or perhaps did not exist at all. Those who are lucky will discover their faith for the first time or have it revitalized. They will see and understand true unconditional love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Bill Belknaps Unconditional Love and Faith Observed is about unconditional love and faith in and for our Lord God and Jesus Christ. He shows us how these same emotions relate to all our relationships with people, especially those we love. Belknap shares how he received instructions from God and how God answered his prayers. He honestly and succinctly describes how God directed his earlier life without his acknowledgment. With the study of the Bible and the encouragement, help, and enlightenment of his wife, Donna, before her death, Belknap has learned how important unconditional love and faith are to each of us in our relationships with God, with our loved ones, and with all the people around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in his later years, Belknap wants to help you find a deep, God-filled life regardless of your age. Unconditional Love and Faith Observed will help you along your faith journey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
