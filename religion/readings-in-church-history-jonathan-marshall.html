  <title>Readings In Church History - Jonathan Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What began a number of years ago as material for personal enrichment while teaching a church history course to high school students has finally come together in print form. While certainly not a comprehensive treatment of the literature from eighteen centuries of church history, the accompanying texts do cover a broad cross-section of our ecclesiastical heritage. As you read the writings of these men and women from prior generations, remember that they suffered much at the hands of men for the sake of the Gospel. Remember, too, that it was by the grace of God that these often ordinary individuals from unremarkable beginnings accomplished great things for the cause of Christ.
