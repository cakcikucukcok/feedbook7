  <title>Sophia&#39;s Table - Kathy Zamonski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sophia&#39;s Table has emerged from the first contemplative writing series I offered. Four women writers joined me for what was to be a six-week series. At the completion of the series, they decided to continue on a monthly basis for six months, then again, and once again. The work became more personal as the women&#39;s trust deepened into friendship over the course of the year in which they shared their stories.
All of us have found writing to be central to leading healthy, balanced lives; to gaining fresh perspective; and to finding meaning and purpose. Each of us has a distinct voice pitched and toned by her unique life experience. Yet Sophias Table is more than a collection of voices. The production of the book itself is a true collaboration of time and talent, engaging the gifts of each of us to bring the book to publication." />
