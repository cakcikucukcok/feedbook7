  <title>What the Church Forgot to Remember - Peter Triolo Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Christianity has gone from orthodoxy to evangelical crusades, from great demonstrations of miracles to signs and wonders, and to the promoting of prosperity in the body of Christ. The ideals of honesty and fundamental truths have been replaced by what we think and feel. The truth has been reduced to whether or not it is relevant in our society. The mindset is if it feels right, do it, even if it is wrong. Moral stability has been replaced by anything goes. We have misplaced things important to Christ.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In &lt;i&gt;What the Church Forgot to Remember,&lt;/i&gt; author Peter Triolo Jr. presents the truth about the how and why of Christianity and provides a reminder to what should be close to our hearts regarding Jesus and His church. Through scriptural examples, Triolo shows how the truth can be found in the Bible through Gods own words.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;What the Church Forgot to Remember&lt;/i&gt; reminds us that before there was time, God loved us and that love is everlasting. Theres still time to change the fast-food mentality of what we want and get back to what God wants.&lt;/P&gt;" />
