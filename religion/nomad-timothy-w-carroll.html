  <title>Nomad - Timothy W Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you ready to Step out of the Darkness and into the Light?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point many of us have suffered from anxiety and depression. If not ourselves we&amp;rsquo;ve walked alongside someone else who has. Sadly, many who suffer try to hide their pain with drugs, alcohol, or other addictions. This lifestyle only leads to more pain, more guilt, and more shame.&lt;br /&gt;
Many people who are clinically depressed, do not get the necessary help to properly heal. Instead, they settle for a nomadic life. On the surface this type of life may seem tolerable. However, a deeper look reveals a life of isolation and loneliness.&lt;br /&gt;
Author Timothy W. Carroll can relate. Although he suffered from depression and anxiety, he found a way out of the nomadic life. It is his deep passion to now share this way of escape with others. In this groundbreaking book you will discover how to:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Walk away from a life of &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Truly understand why you are never alone&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Unpack who you are on the inside&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Love and embrace who God made you to be&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Value others, especially the unlovable&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Gain an eternal perspective&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Master the Spiritual Fusion concept&lt;br /&gt;
Although this book began as a collection of Timothy&amp;rsquo;s prose and poetry writings, it morphed into a powerful guide to help you or your loved ones move out of the darkness and into the light. Let today be the day that you leave the nomadic life for good.&lt;/p&gt;" />
