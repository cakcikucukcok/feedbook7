  <title>A Traveller&#39;s Guide to the Journey - Christopher Tingle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is a Journey.  We&#39;ve probably all heard that phrase at one time or another, but what kind of Journey are you on?  Do you know where you are going or where you came from?  Does it really matter?  What sort of a Journey has it been for you?  If you&#39;ve stood on top of mountains, literally or figuratively, or if you&#39;ve just plodded along in the valleys, wouldn&#39;t it be nice sometimes to just have a travelling companion?
This book is just that  - a travelling companion to help you see through the author&#39;s eyes and hear through his ears the wonder of the Journey.  You will visit the time and place you began, and walk with him through to a place that is beyond your imagining.  Be prepared to laugh and cry, and to allow his experiences to enrich your own Journey.  You will see new ways to walk along your own path with a skip in your step and a song in your heart." />
