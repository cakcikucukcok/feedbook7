  <title>Become the Solution You Are Created to Be - Obembe Olutola Michael</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is going to push out the world changer in you. It has been
written to bring out in you that which is to be but have not yet been, that
which you need to be that you have not become and to draw out to you
what you can be in this life and to your generation.
Men are said to be born equal but we all know men are not equal. In the
calendar of God things happen for a reason so you are born into this world
for a reason, not just a mere reason but for a unique reason because you are
not a coincidence. Get to understand who you are because you are the best
option the world has to solve the reason why you are here. Its just you that
is needed to make things right, do not fall off your destiny by loosing out on
purpose for the purpose of a thing is best known to the manufacturer so find
out from God today and live your life by his design and not by default.
A little baby is like a blank disk drive when born, it knows and contains
nothing until things are said to him/her and events happen around him/
her i.e. basically until the five senses start catching things around. Be like
that young child and start catching stuffs that will enhance your destiny
ride. The death of Jesus was to bring mankind back to the former glory
of leadership, dominion, solution and divine relationship. If you are born
again you are a solution either in the making or one already on duty because
your world needs youWake Up!
Your destiny assignments are too many for you to live a life of jeopardy,
a life of ignorance or a life of self non-discovery. Wake Up! The light of
God in you is meant for a purpose, His decision to push you forth is not
12 Michael Obembe
without a reason, the blessings, gifts, talents and stuffs of God in you are
not for personal enrichments they are for specific areas of the world so find
those areas and fulfill destiny.
Myles Munroe once said that your existence is a proof that something is
finished that you are born to express or implement. In other words, God
has finished an invention and you are the project manager here on earth.
Nobody is born without a mission neither is anyone born a mistake nor an
experiment but its your destiny from heaven that brought you here, that
destiny of being a solution to your world.
You are born with a solution destinyIt is in you. The destiny of a thing
is in the thing so the solution ability you possess is right inside you all you
need to do is to push it out. Do not live life as a spectator, stand and be that
centre-stage actor you are meant to be. Do not live life as a photocopy, live
the life as the original God created you to be. There is something unique
about youits the mission and vision set ahead of you and it is your being
different that makes you a world reference. Remember, only you are with a
unique vision, mission, talent, and gift that the world does not have.
Do not run away from your destiny, choose to achieve it and build
your purpose for a mission
There are things you need to know, things you need to remember, and
things you need to start doing to be that solution you are born to be. That
is what this book teaches; it teaches a life to be lived left unlived by many.
