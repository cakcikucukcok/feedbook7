  <title>The Secret Success of Marriage - Branford B Yeboah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Prayer has always been a vital part of Christian life. By studying the prayers of men of God in the Scriptures, you will begin to understand the concept of prayer. The men whose prayers moved God to act were ordinary men like us. Nevertheless, they knew the power of prayer and its benefits. The prayer these men prayed was not ordinary prayer but intense prayer. 
People who pray with God have a relationship with Him. If you carefully study Scripture, you will notice that the way the prophets prayed reveals how married couples should pray to move God to intervene in their failing marriages. Their prayer demonstrates the principles that can be gleaned and clearly identified, and which, if applied to marital life, can work wonders. When studied, the prayers of these great men who walked with God provide a wealth of insight. 
The New Testament offers us prayer to which we even better relate. The Gospels centre on key events in the life of Christ, including examples of prayer. These examples do not only give us insight into the heart of Christ, but also give us key instructions on how to pray." />
