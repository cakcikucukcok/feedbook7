  <title>The Entire Endtime Sequence - Robert L. Carlton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;n recent times, many people have come to realize that this world is approaching&lt;br /&gt;its end. Most believe that GOD is in control of how it will end, and they&lt;br /&gt;are right! Not only is GOD in control, He has a Master Endtime Plan for&lt;br /&gt;this earth and its peoples. Moreover, in His Holy Word, the Bible, GOD has&lt;br /&gt;described His plan; He has described it very clearly and in great detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This book desribes the &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; Endtime Scenario, making it so simple anyone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;can understand it. &lt;/strong&gt;It reviews the scriptures that describe each major Endtime&lt;br /&gt;happening and other scriptures that explicitly define the chronological sequence&lt;br /&gt;for those happenings. It identifies several calendar timelines within the scriptures&lt;br /&gt;that measure the precise times between various Endtime happenings. To give&lt;br /&gt;confidence in its conclusions, it identifies four separate sets of Scriptures that&lt;br /&gt;clearly define the sequence for the events that will lead to CHRIST&#39;S return and&lt;br /&gt;the Christian Rapture/Ressurection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone, even those who are not familiar with either the Bible or the Christian&lt;br /&gt;theology, should easily understand this book. &lt;strong&gt;They will understand the entire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endtime Scenario that JESUS CHRIST foretold,&lt;/strong&gt; the major happenings that&lt;br /&gt;will take place, the sequence in which they will happen, and the specific scriptures&lt;br /&gt;that describe all these things. Moreover, they will understand how all of these&lt;br /&gt;things relate to GOD&#39;S Covenants and His labors of the past 6000 years. They&lt;br /&gt;will see that all of the Endtime happenings are just the grand finale of those&lt;br /&gt;labors. &lt;strong&gt;Most importantly, each reader will not only allow what is going to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;happen in the Endtimes, he or she will know how they can control their own&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eternal destiny.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
