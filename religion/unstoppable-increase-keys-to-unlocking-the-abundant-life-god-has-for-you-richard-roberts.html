  <title>Unstoppable Increase: Keys to Unlocking The Abundant Life God Has for You - Richard Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is our part when it comes to walking in unstoppable increase in our lives and what does the God-kind of increase look like?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;God is an &amp;quot;if-then&amp;quot; God. When we want to see God move in our lives, we have to do something first. Then&amp;ndash;and only then&amp;ndash;will He do His part. He promises us in His Word salvation, healing, provision, restoration, wisdom and increase... but only if we believe, receive, confess, obey and give to Him in faith, believing for our harvests. Only He can do what He can do. But only you and I can do what we can do. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps you&amp;#39;ve been through some sort of wilderness experience and you&amp;#39;ve wondered, Where is God in all this? There is a real devil in the world, and according to God&amp;#39;s Word in John 10:10, he is working overtime to steal, kill and destroy. But that scripture also says Jesus is present in your life too, and He has come so you could have life...abundant life...life that is overflowing with provision and filled with increase in every area...spirit, soul and body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
