  <title>We Are One - Ben Adam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Global society is at a crossroads in determining how to deal with existential risks emanating from intercultural, socioeconomic, geopolitical, and environmental challenges. Social governance is central to how all these issues are addressed. At the same time, there is an increasing awareness of core spirituality that cuts across major faiths and ideologies. The author posits that there are a common set of values that are embedded in all major faiths and social governance systems. These faiths, systems, or traditions have independently arrived at these values with the maturation of human societies, across time and geography. As they have stood the test of time and varied cultural settings, they are more than likely to guide human society toward successfully addressing major global challenges. 
While quite a lot has been written about values that cuts across the Abrahamic religions, or even across all major Abrahamic and Vedic faiths, very little work appears to have been inspired by the values that cut across them and nontheistic governance systems. 
This short book posits a concise and intuitive common set of values crossing major faiths and nontheistic social governance systems, including liberal democracy and social democracy, as supported by excerpts of scripture or basic charters." />
