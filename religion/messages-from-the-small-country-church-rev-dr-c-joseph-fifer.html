  <title>Messages from the Small Country Church - Rev. Dr. C. Joseph Fifer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this day and age of bigger and better or bigger is better, even our churches are starting to follow suit. The alarming trend that is occurring now in America is the assumption that if a group is big, it must be right; if a church is bigger than others, it must be even more right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This assumption is not correct. This nation was built and became what it is today one small church at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of those small churches are still there today, right where they were first necessary. And they are still necessary today. They are still occupied by Christians who meet on every first day of the week. They gather to give the first of their week to worship He who is to be first in Spirit and in truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this booka compilation of readings, sermons, observations, and an invitationthe Reverend Dr. C. Joseph Fifer (Pastor Joe), who serves a small country church in rural western Ohio, seeks to give voice to the message that millions are now missing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
