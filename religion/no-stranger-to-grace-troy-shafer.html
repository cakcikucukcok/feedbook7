  <title>No Stranger to Grace - Troy Shafer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The American Dream is a set of ideals in which freedom included the opportunity for prosperity and success, and an upward social mobility achieved through hard work. This is the definition of the American Dream by James Truslow Adams in 1931, &quot;life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement&quot; regardless of social class or circumstances of birth.&lt;p&gt;
One of my favorite Chapters in the Bible is Romans 13  &quot;Love fulfills the law.&quot;...  &quot;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&quot;  Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; How does this impact your thoughts and actions? &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Cammy and I had a childless home.  So we asked God for what He could do to fill our lives with joy and hope.  He provided us a home to love parentless children?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I woke up in my hospital bed suffering from Acute Congestive Heart and Kidney Failure.  I am still recovering from a Disc replacement and Fusion surgery at L-4-L5 in which I suffer from Stenosis and L-5 Nerve Root damage which has left me in a Wheel Chair. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And I still find myself asking God to help me with the void of not having my own children. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wrote a book about our story to encourage other childless families, that their love is needed and wanted by children who believe in God, and are trapped inside the US Foster Care System.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And to let other Christian Families know that there are children stuck in the Foster care system that can be adapted by loving and caring Christian parents." />
