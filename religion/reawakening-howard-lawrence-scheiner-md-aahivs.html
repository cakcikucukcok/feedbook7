      <meta name="description" content="DR. HOWARD SCHEINER WELCOMES YOU TO A GREATER REALITY
REAWAKENING  A BOOK OF LIFE AND A STORY BEYOND TIME&quot;
(New York, NY)  Dr. Howard Scheiner welcomes you to a Greater Reality!  Located on a point of intersection of science and spirituality called belief his new book REAWAKENING, details a highly personal journey of life and spirit that lead him to a greater understanding of universal truth and offers readers enlightenment and wisdom through their own journey of life.
A successful Manhattan physician, Scheiner awakes each day happy to be alive, feeling blessed with all the joys and sorrows of his life, joyfully connected to All-That-Is and thoroughly savoring his singular journey.  With greater understanding came a new perspective.  His first manuscript, A BOOK OF LIFE was and is the story of his journey to understanding and belief in a Greater Reality.  In REAWAKENING, the words he now writes come from this new and different perspective  words that come to him outside his five senses.  They come from spirit; from greater wisdom and expanded consciousness.  
The big questions of the meaning and purpose of life have always been with me in some subliminal manner, but the easier questions of life and death seemed more within my grasp.  Perhaps that is part of the reason I became a physician.  So, over many years, I have become very well acquainted with both the mode of entry to and exit from this life.  When it came to religious dogma and faith in a higher power, I completely recoiled in disbelief. says Scheiner.  I made a leap of faith and as a result achieved a sense of freedom that I have never before experienced.  That leap was to believe the reality I experienced and not doubt the truth of what happened. 
Soul bearing, highly personal, sometimes humorous and often shocking REAWAKENING offers a new interpretation regarding the concept of God / Universe.  Through examples of his own life, Scheiner gives readers understanding and insight into their own personal journeys." />
