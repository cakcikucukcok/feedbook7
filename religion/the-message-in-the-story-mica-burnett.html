  <title>The Message in The Story - Mica Burnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Message in The Story by Mica Burnett is a collection of memories and true accounts that highlight experiences when the author undeniably recognized a message from God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written with the belief that if we keep our eyes and hearts open, there are messages waiting for us, even in the most average day, in our most ordinary lives. We do not have to wait for the seas to part, or bushes to burn to authentically encounter God&amp;#39;s power and connection. In fact, it is in the most personal of places where we often find those messages that seem tailor-made for us and begin to change everything, from the path we were on to the relationships we were in, to ultimately, our relationship with our Creator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete with a journal for personal reflection at the end of every chapter, this book may be used for self or group study as the reader reflects upon past and present experiences and begins to recognize and share divine messages. Its stories are meant to inspire readers to share the Good News, not by &amp;quot;selling&amp;quot; people Christianity, but by sharing the authentic stories&amp;nbsp;of what God has done and is doing in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
