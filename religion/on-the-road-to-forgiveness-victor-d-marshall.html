  <title>On the Road to Forgiveness - Victor D. Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Each individual has been hurt emotionally, physically, psychologically, or spiritually at some point in his or her life. Although some people have been able to address their painful issue and move on, far too many persons resolve that they will never forgive the person who has injured them. Victor D. Marshall holds the view that people who are unable to forgive and let go of past hurts have not experienced healing. In fact, the major principle of On the Road to Forgiveness: Experiencing Healing on the Way is that for a person to forgive, he needs to experience some degree of healing; and to experience healing, an individual needs to forgive themselves and others. Out of this audacious perspective, Victor has developed eight principles, on which each chapter is built. 
Marshall then identifies five stages that every individual needs to pass through in order to experience healing and move on with his or her life. In his biblically grounded, insightful, and well-researched book, Victor uses a psycho-spiritual approach to illustrate the impact of forgiveness on our lives. A key element of this volume, On the Road to Forgiveness is the practical cases he includes to provide analytical discussions. If you are struggling with issues of forgiveness, this book identifies ways by which you can overcome living in the past. Victor also shares some major discoveries about the psychological benefits of forgiving others, one of which is that forgiveness contributes to the fulfillment of various psychological needs. 
As you turn the pages of this intriguing book, you will be helped to experience emotional freedom, be encouraged to develop your spirituality further, and ultimately grasp the importance of focusing on issues of eternal value. May the Divine One be with you on this journey!" />
