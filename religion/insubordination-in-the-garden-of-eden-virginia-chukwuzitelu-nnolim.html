	Origin of unyielding woman
	Adam and Eve lost their Apartment
	Germination of the first fruit of the Garden of Eden
	The best among the worsts
	Actions of the New breed on the new Universe
	The Adulterous Generation
	Household of Isaac and family politics
	The wave of immorality in Jacobs family
	Jesus remains a mystery to many, even to His Own disciples and to todays Christians" />
