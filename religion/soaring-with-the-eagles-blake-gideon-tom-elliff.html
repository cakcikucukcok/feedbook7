This book is the fruit of that practice It is not a call to endorse prayer but to enter into it. It is not a call to assent to truth but to act upon the truth you already have in hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

It can be used as a personal devotional, for a small group book study, or even for sermon or lesson preparation.
