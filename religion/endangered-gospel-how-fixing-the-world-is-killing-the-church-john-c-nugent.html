  <title>Endangered Gospel: How Fixing the World is Killing the Church - John C. Nugent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For centuries, Christians sought to rescue people from this world. Today, we&#39;re trying to fix it. While this shift is helpful in some ways, in other ways it can be quite dangerous.   Endangered Gospel flips the script on this conversation by stressing the core gospel truth that rather than ushering in a new world through social activism, God&#39;s people already are the new world in Christ. It&#39;s not our job to make this world a better place, but to be the better place God has already made in this world. That&#39;s good news!   If we let go of this truth, we become servants of the world and not God. We also lose the great joy and abundant life that God intended us to have in community. Jesus himself said that the world will know we are Christians by our love for one another--not the fervor of our activism.   Social action makes us feel relevant and alive, but it can&#39;t be the center of our new life in Christ. Endangered Gospel explores how we might enthusiastically embrace the social dimensions of the gospel without divorcing them from the church or forcing them on the world.   Read this book, hear the gospel story afresh, and embrace the good news of God&#39;s kingdom!" />
