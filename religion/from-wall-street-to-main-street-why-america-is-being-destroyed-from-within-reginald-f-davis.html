  <title>From Wall Street to Main Street: Why America Is Being Destroyed from Within - Reginald F. Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From Wall Street to Main Street, the moral toxicity in our country is alarming. There are frightening signs that America is on the same path to destruction as the Roman Empire was before its fall. Since America has embraced secular progressivism and redefined its traditional spiritual values, our nation has greatly declined. History points to the judgment of God that came upon nations for their moral toxicity. Unless America repents, returns to God, reorders its priorities, and sets its financial house in order, future generations will ask, Why has the mighty fallen?  America needs to heed Abraham Lincoln, who said, America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedom, it will be because we destroyed ourselves from within. From Wall Street to Main Street is a trumpet blast not only to alert Americans to our spiritual and moral decline but also to encourage our citizens to save this great republic. Our struggle is not merely social, economic, and political--it is spiritual. There is hope, and this hope is in the struggle to make God, justice, and morality central in our nation once again." />
