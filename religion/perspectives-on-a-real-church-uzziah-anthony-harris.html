  <title>Perspectives on a Real Church - Uzziah Anthony Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Will the real church please stand up? We exist in a world of extreme flux and volatilityone that is unpredictable and filled with pain. But why? Could it be that the church who was intended to be a model and beacon of light in the earth has instead become a follower and dispenser of the same ills that malign our landscape? The church, in her pursuit to have church, has somehow lost her way; the church as an institution has exploded (possibly morphing into something not recognized by its author) while the organism has suffered, causing her to forfeit the influence and power and connection she once possessed.
In Perspectives on a Real Church, we take a look at what and who the church isboth where she has been and is, currently with the hope of charting a path toward where she could be. This literary work takes a look at what the real church should be and seeks to objectively look at whether or not our church is meeting the standard, as well as what can be done in the places where she needs to step up.
One thing is for certain, and that is that the church was created for both goodness and greatness, that she was intended as a radical transformative agent in a context where transformation is much needed. When the church becomes what she was intended, thenand only thencan she be a catalyst for resurgence and revival to both believers and nonbelievers alike. The world in turn, will be a better place more capable of reaching its full potential." />
