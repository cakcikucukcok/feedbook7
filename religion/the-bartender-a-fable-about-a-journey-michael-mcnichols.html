  <title>The Bartender: A Fable About A Journey - Michael McNichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Christian faith is continually challenged by the tension between certainty and mystery. A historic faith can seem threatened by the uncomfortable recognition that God continues to work in a rapidly changing culture. The Bartender is a fable about the messiness and unpredictability of lives being opened up to God through relationships characterized by deep listening and looking for the ongoing work of God in the world. The parallel and sometimes intersecting paths of two men on different spiritual journeys reveal how God seems to be present in the most scandalous of human dramas. When both men take risks that threaten their own religious sensibilities, they find new ways of living out the implications of their faith." />
