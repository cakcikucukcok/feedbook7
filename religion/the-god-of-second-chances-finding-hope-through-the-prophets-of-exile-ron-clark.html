  <title>The God of Second Chances: Finding Hope through the Prophets of Exile - Ron Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When the people of Judah were taken captive by the Babylonians, their world was drastically changed. While in exile they experienced shame, guilt, fear, and displacement. However, their God had been traumatized by their behavior and also grieved with them. Yet, Yahweh gave them a second chance by forgiving them and bringing them home. God offered them hope, mercy, and love. The prophets were God&#39;s chosen messengers, not only to provide a new vision of what could be, but to suffer with the people. These servants were caught in the middle between a passionate God and traumatized people. As the people returned to Jerusalem to rebuild their city and their lives, the prophets were with them to remind them that God had not abandoned them.  The author suggests that the prophets live on today through the church as those who engage their community, fight for people&#39;s hearts, and remind others that God gives second chances. Clark shares stories from his personal ministry to the marginalized in Portland, Oregon, who seek relief from shame, suffering, and hopelessness. In this hope our community receives new vision through a loving God and persistent prophets." />
