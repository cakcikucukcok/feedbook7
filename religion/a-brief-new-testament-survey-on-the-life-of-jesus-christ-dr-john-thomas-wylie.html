  <title>A Brief New Testament Survey on the Life of Jesus Christ - Dr. John Thomas Wylie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I recently published my seventh title, and the Lord compelled me, Press on toward the mark. I realize much could be said of Jesus Christ, and that would not be enough. If it were possible, one might pen as much as the number of hairs on ones head or the number of stars in the heavenly skies, but thats not enough said about Christ. If I could pen the sum total grains of the sand in the desert, that would not be enough. Thats not enough to express the awesome nature of Jesus Christ. (It would be impossible to begin to scratch realitys surface.) What I do know is that a man can begin somewhere and express his views concerning the Master. So I conclude this and begin my topic on A Brief New Testament Survey on the Life of Jesus Christ. 
Thus, grace unto God our Father who provides for all according to his glory and the making of this eighth title, A Brief New Testament Survey on the Life of Jesus Christ. This publication is a brief survey and not an expository study on the life of Jesus Christ and teachings of Christ. The content of the publication is intended to give a more accurate account according to the Gospel of Luke and other scriptures to strengthen the young readers confidence in what the gospel will tell about Christ. Although every episode of Jesus Christ is not covered, that is not this books intent. The intent is to give many young people and first-time readers a starting point Christ-wards.
