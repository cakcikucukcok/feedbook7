  <title>The 8-Lane Highway - Danny L. Formhalls Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Gospel message and Christianity has changed since Jesus established it with His disciples and followers over 2000 years ago. When Jesus Called those He wanted (Mark 3:15) He set in motion a plan to win the world. The torch was passed to the early church patriarchs and their followers, who worked hard to imitate Jesus life and ministry. They did their job and the gospel was preached; the message of the cross raced to neighboring countries and lands. America would eventually become a beacon of light to further the Saviors message exponentially around the globe. In spite of the many hurdles and pitfalls along the way, the message of the cross has gone around the world. So, what has changed? 
Since the late 1950s a fundamental shift has occurred in the Body of Christ, the local church. The torch has been passed to a different type of believer. Somewhere along the way many believers stopped believing, the preachers stopped preaching the whole gospel and the true meaning of the word Christian has been hijacked. A lost world, especially those in the United States, brag and flaunt their sin out in the open. At the same time many believers have begun to wink at what the Bible calls sin. God will not be mocked for too much longer. This choice has led to weak believers and an embolden nation. Too many believers in Christ have lost their passion and voice. Like a lion waiting to pounce, the Devil has launched a powerful attack. 
The Bible speaks of two roads. A narrow road leading to God and eternal life and a broad road, which I call The 8-Lane Highway. This road leads to destruction and many, including Christians travel its crocked path. This book is about the eight lanes that make up this road. This book addresses the many believers and so-called Christians that live and function on and around the broad road. Their choices have greatly impacted the local church and the Christian culture. It doesnt take a Christian to recognize that America is changing; everyone knows it. At the same time, the local church is changing; and yet, not everyone sees it. It is essential that all believers in Christ become the true followers He died to establish. Jesus hasnt changed His message; or the urgency to share with everyone. Its time to wake up, to rise up, and to speak up." />
