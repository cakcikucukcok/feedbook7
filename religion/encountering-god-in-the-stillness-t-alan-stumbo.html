  <title>Encountering God in the Stillness - T. Alan Stumbo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We are always searching for things to do in order to draw God nearer to us, when all that is really needed is to become still before Him. In an age of technological commotion and striving to succeed, few of us see how busy we really are. It has been said, Busyness is not of the devil; busyness is the devil. Noise, entertainment, habits, and everyday distractions are keeping many believers from breaking through to true rest, and fullness in Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will you become one of those who discover the treasure of stillness? Will you take the challenge and rise from the ashes with a new heart, a new spirit, renewed strength, renewed passion, and a new purpose for living? Join the author as he retells the story of his life-changing experience on the North Shore of Lake Superior. It was during a year of stillness and seclusion that he discovered what was missing from his daily walk with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we encounter Godwe are changed. When we are changedwe discover peace and rest. Are you weary from all the noise? Are you languishing spiritually? He still speaks to the weary, heavy laden, hungry and thirsty. Come and sit a spell. Be still and know that He is God. He is God, be still and you will know Him. &lt;/p&gt;" />
