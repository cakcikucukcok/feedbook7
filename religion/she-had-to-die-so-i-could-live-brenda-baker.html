  <title>She Had to Die, so I Could Live - Brenda Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a Study Guide.  Are you having difficulty letting go of past hurts and not quite sure how to move forward? Have you ever felt challenged when trying to see yourself in a positive way? Are you carrying baggage from previous relationships? Have you prayed over and over again asking God to change a situation, but nothing has happened? Do you need a more positive outlook on life?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In the book, She Had to Die, So I Could Live the author uses her own experiences to illustrate how God carries us through difficult times. Brenda came to realize that in order for her to receive all God had for her, there were parts of her which needed to die. She would need to change how she saw herself both inside and out. It wasnt an easy process, but it was necessary. Once she allowed God to peel back the layers, things began to shift in her life. As a result, Brenda wrote She Had to Die, So I Could Live to help encourage others. 
When used as a supplement, the Study Guide will give you exercises and activities to help you practice walking into the destiny God has for you. The thought provoking questions will assist with getting to know yourself better, letting go of negative thinking, thus allowing you to see yourself as God sees you. Once you do this, then every other area of your life will begin to change as you come to understand who you are and what you deserve in life. The Guide is great for both individuals and group study! Enjoy your journey to happiness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
