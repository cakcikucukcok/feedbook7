  <title>21St Century Ministry - Benjamin Maira</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Ministry of God For All People
Since early days of 21st Century, I have desired to write a book about 21st Century Ministry.
I am glad this book on the ministry of God is out and you are holding it in your hands. This book is a ministry tool for the service of God. Everything God does is by his Holy Spirit, his power and the gospel. The Holy Spirit touches people by His presence and power. In 21st Century Ministry, like the days of Jesus Christ and the apostles (1st Century) people need to know the Holy Spirit and the word of God. The world today, need to see the Holy Spirit at work and hear the word of God. If you read the books of Luke and Acts of apostles by Luke, you will see the ministry of Jesus Christ and apostles was successful and effective because of the Holy Spirit and the word of God to the people. The 21st Century is special time for the ministry of God to the people.
In 21st Century Ministry, you will realize five points for the  ministry of God to the people of the world, in the day that we are living.
	Ministry Source: Jesus Christ is the source of the ministry. 
	Ministry and Church: people must find ministry in the church.  
	A to Z of the Ministry of God: these are ministry insights in alphabetical order.
	Ministry Reference: all key terms to do with ministry are explained from Bible.
	How to minister to a person: you will learn divine ways to minister to a person.
In 21st Century: it is the ministry of God that works and strategic for today. Ministry is real. In reading 21st Century Ministry book, you will agree the ministry of God brings results. God always start ministry and do it to any generation and culture by Jesus Christ, and his grace. Also in reading 21st Century Ministry, you will agree many servants and ministers of God were used for his glory. For example, men like Moses, Samuel, Elijah, Peter, Paul, Silas, and Apollos were all called, empowered and used by God in a special way. And today, God wants to use you. In 21st Century, the time has come to serve God and minister to people by the Holy Spirit and the word. In this present world both sinners and saints need the ministry of the Holy Spirit and the word of God. I have written this book: 21st Century Ministry, so that the people of the world may know God and his ministry. No man, angel or a thing is the source of the ministry but the Lord Jesus Christ." />
