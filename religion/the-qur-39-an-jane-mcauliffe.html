  <title>The Qur&#39;an - Jane McAuliffe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Millions of non-Muslims know the name of the Muslim scripture, whether it is written as &quot;Qur&#39;an&quot; or &quot;Quran&quot; or &quot;Koran.&quot; But for most, that is all they know. Many have fallen victim to the mass of misinformation that circulates about the Qur&#39;an. Others may have tried to read the Qur&#39;an, but the text itself is tough to decipher. With no sense of context, chronology, or interpretive history, many would-be readers of the Qur&#39;an quickly give up the effort. As for those trying to find out what the Qur&#39;an says about any particular subject or issue, they, too, soon discover that this is not a simple or straightforward undertaking.
A clear, concise introduction to the holy book that guides the lives of 1.6 billion people on our planet, this brief volume opens the world of the Qur&#39;an to interested readers who want to know where this scripture came from and how it has achieved a profound influence in today&#39;s world.  Writing in an easy-to-read question-and-answer format, Jane McAuliffe, one of the world&#39;s foremost scholars of the Qur&#39;an, introduces readers to this important text by discussing its origins, structure, themes, interpretations, and what it has to say about a host of critical contemporary issues. Where did the Qur&#39;an come from? Do Muslims believe that the Qur&#39;an is God&#39;s own word? How do Muslims study the Qur&#39;an? What does the Qur&#39;an say about God?  About family? About ethics? About violence? By answering the questions that many people have about the Qur&#39;an and its role in Muslim faith, this book offers an invaluable resource for anyone who is curious about one of the world&#39;s most important faiths." />
