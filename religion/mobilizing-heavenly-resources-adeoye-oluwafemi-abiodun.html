  <title>Mobilizing Heavenly Resources - Adeoye Oluwafemi Abiodun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is specially vomited by the holy spirit to stir up men who have slept as it is written while men sleep this book will help many who are already living a minus life, many that are ignorant of who they are or the privileges and the resources are God has created and kept for them. Ignorance is no excuse in spiritual matters and God do not want us to be kept in the dark so that you can do your own part which is to pray and he to do his own part which is to act and bring answers.
There are plenty of wholesome resources which you and I can use and quite not a few is discussed in this first edition let take a look at Job 38:22-23 hast thou entered into the weapons of the snow? Or hast thou seen the treasure of the hail, which I have reserved against the day of trouble, against the day of battle and war.
-	The verse explains that God is ever ready, he is always prepared
-	God sees far beyond what we humans see, his foresight into future is far greater than philosophers on their tip toe.
-	His insight is unimaginable (Daniel 2:22 he revealed deep and secret things; he knoweth what is in darkness and light dwells with him)
-	God is always at his best when we men are at our worst
-	He is the ultimate killing machine and he has in his arsenal strange weapons to fight strange battles.
-	God himself his the solution for he has the solution to all trouble and problems of life
-	God is still speaking today only if you tune to his frequency and his modulation and ready to obey
The book is simply put as Williams Shakespeare has said there is a tide in the affairs of men to which if taken up leads to fortunes, you can through this book change the season around you by saying no it must stop, it cannot continue like this, let there be a change.
Read and let your life change." />
