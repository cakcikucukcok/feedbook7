  <title>The Poetic Scriptures of Luke - Michael D. Wester</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The attention of audiences have been captivated by rhythm and rhyme. Who has not appreciated the works of Dr. Seuss or listening to poems that mimic The Night Before Christmas? Imagine if the Bible, Gods Word, were put into that format. Would that not also capture attention? Read the following excerpt where Jesus tells a story about an unlikely hero. Read it slowly and with care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 10:30 Jesus answered, A certain man&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Was traveling to Jericho,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Coming down from Jerusalem,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A dangerous route to go.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Into the hands of thieves he fell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Who stripped him of all his clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; They went off leaving him half dead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; After giving him many blows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 10:31 It so happened a certain priest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Was traveling down that road,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; But when he saw the half-dead man,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; On the other side he strode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 10:32 A Levite, too, was traveling,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And seeing him in that place,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; He passed by on the other side,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Continuing with his pace.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 10:33 A traveling Samaritan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Came upon him where he lay,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And when he saw him he was moved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; To care for the man that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This book is the beginning work of putting Gods Word to rhythm and rhyme. Enjoy the writings of Luke as you have read before but to the beat of a drum and to a sound that will impact your heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
