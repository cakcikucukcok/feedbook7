  <title>Seasons for Your Soul - Sheila Cox Gagen, Beth Sturges, Dianne Farmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Seasons for Your Soul paints pictures for your mind as you reflect on how God is working and moving in your life. Sheilas collection of poems, psalms, and reflections bring a feeling of peace and contentment. The author keeps returning to one constant  the love and mercy of God.
No matter where it is in the calendar year, you are living through today.
Whether good or bad, happy or sad, you are dealing with life on some emotional level.
How often do you stop to be in tune with your feelings at any given moment?
Some people are more naturally inclined to relate to their inner selves, while others may need to prime the pump! Either way, this book was brought together for you. We pray that whatever type of day you are living, you might connect with many pages and stages of life given throughout this book. We would love for you to pause a moment each day for thought and reflection and to open up to your feelings.
The psalmists of the Bible seemed to understand this very process and were unafraid to share all of their feelings with a Holy yet infinitely compassionate God. We are all in different places on our paths through this life. We pray that you will be blessed with Gods peace and guidance as you move forward toward Him.
Join us in the journey!
Taste and see that the Lord is good:
blessed is the one who takes refuge in him.  Psalm 34:8" />
