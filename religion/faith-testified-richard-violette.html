  <title>Faith Testified - Richard Violette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who am I? &lt;br /&gt;
Why am I here? &lt;br /&gt;
Does God exist? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have all wrestled these questions. With encouragement from my wife, I began to write prayers and devotionals in a journal as it related to my faith and belief in God. That turned into this. I have found it helpful reading or listening to others share their experiences and how it relates to my own situations. That is the purpose of this book, or, specifically, why it was Gods purpose for me to write this book. Was it part of Gods plan for you to pick up this book to read something from it that relates to your life?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;My hope and my prayer for all of you is to know your lives have meaning, to believe. It helped clarify my lifes meaning when I began my walk with God. I believe it can for you as well.&lt;/p&gt;" />
