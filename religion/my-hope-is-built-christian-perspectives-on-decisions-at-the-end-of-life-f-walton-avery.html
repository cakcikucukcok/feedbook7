  <title>My Hope Is Built …: Christian Perspectives on Decisions at the End of Life - F. Walton Avery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With medical advances, people are living longer than ever before, and in many cases, with a higher quality of life for much of that time. Despite the potential of a long, healthy life, however, many individuals find themselves facing end-of-life issues they never anticipated. And to Christians, those decisions may be especially difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;My Hope Is Built : Christian Perspectives on Decisions at the End of Life&lt;/i&gt;, author F. Walton Avery examines critical writings about available options for those facing end-of-life decisions for themselves or for someone they love. He looks at Christian responses to vital questions that come at the end of life. Avery looks closely at whether the prohibition against suicide or assisted death can be suspended and, in the name of Christian faith, the suffering individual be permitted to commit suicide or be party to assisted death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of circumstances, making end-of-life decisions are likely to be difficult. &lt;i&gt;My Hope Is Built : Christian Perspectives on Decisions at the End of Life&lt;/i&gt; can help one make those decisions in light of their Christian beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
