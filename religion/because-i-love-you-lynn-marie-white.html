  <title>Because, I Love You - Lynn Marie White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;It is amazing what marvelous things God will reveal to those who stop to listen to His still, small voice. Lynn White is just one of those people willing to sit at the feet of the Lord and hear what He has to say to her. Ms. White has been gracious enough to record all that God has whispered to her humble heart so that generations of readers can grow closer to the Lord they love. From the importance of reading your Bible to how God truly feels about us, His creation, Lynn covers it all within the pages of &lt;i&gt;Because, I Love You&lt;/i&gt;. In thought provoking sections, the reader will be drawn in and engaged by Ms. White&#39;s conversational manner and the tenderness God chose to reveal to her.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Not only is &lt;i&gt;Because, I Love You&lt;/i&gt; filled with countless nuggets of wisdom, but it also encourages readers to search out their own intimacy with God and ask Him for their own pieces of revelation. Lynn White equips her readers for a lifelong growing and thriving friendship with God.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;From the first letter to the last paragraph, the words within this book are insightful and encouraging to all who take the time to enjoy their intimate honesty.&lt;/P&gt;" />
