  <title>Suitcase to Heaven - Emilia En L&#39;air</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you are struggling to make sense of this life, it may be that you arent thinking of heaven as your permanent home. The world may disappoint you, but God will never let you down; you just have to receive His embrace and thereby avoid wasting your pain.
In this inspirational memoir, author Emilia En Lair shares her transformation through tribulation, recalling how she turned to God during every single hardship. The trials of her life did not destroy but rather defined her, as God restored her and healed all her wounds and unbearable heartaches. As a consequence, everything she has gained and lost in this world has brought her closer to God by filling her void with spiritual gifts. In addition to her own journey of faith, hope, and miracles, she also offers guided prayers, self-reflections, and further reading from the Scriptures.
No matter what trials or pains you are experiencing, you can find healing in Gods love, forgiveness, and faith. Suitcase to Heaven reminds you that you have not yet reached your final destination and that you are still a traveler with some distance yet to go." />
