Millions suffer from some form of addiction. Dr. Dickersons life story depicts the feelings, situations, and conditions of many. It portrays the spectrum of human affliction and anxieties, fears and frustrations, desires, degradation, hatred, hopes and utopian dreams. Finally the story ends with the exercise of apocalyptic faith in the ultimate triumph of good over evil.&lt;/P&gt;

The book section titled DNA, Life, and God is a depiction of Jesus Christ, who Dr. Dickerson acknowledges as his Higher Power. The term Higher Power is mentioned nine different times, in one form or another in the Twelve-Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. The founders of Alcoholics Anonymous were Christians who realized that the program could also work as long as members acknowledge that the Higher Power of their choice is greater than themselves.&lt;/P&gt;
