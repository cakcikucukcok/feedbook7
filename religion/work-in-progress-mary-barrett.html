  <title>Work in Progress... - Mary Barrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A &lt;b&gt;Collection&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;Reflective&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Devotional&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Spiritual 
Studies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What if there was a such a thing as a toolbox that could help us work on our relationship 
with God and others? Would you be interested?  Our Spiritual journey is a &quot;work in 
progress&quot; keeping it maintained and productive requires the right &quot;tools&quot; for the job.  
Unless we intentionally pick up and apply each tool, they cannot be useful.  Without 
proper and well used Spiritual tools, our relationship are not as fulfilling.&lt;p&gt;
Tools are essentials.  the more we know about each tool the better it will work.  It takes 
commitment and dedication to using the tools that wil make changes in our lives.  If we 
are open to using a Christian toolbox; we will strengthen our relationship with God.  The 
job site of life is hard, these tools make doing the work possible.&lt;p&gt;
this is the fourth book in the Mother In Love Series.  we invite Jesus onto on the job site 
of our hearts as we spend time learning the tools of the Christian trade.  The blueprint 
we will follow offers us scripture, personal stories, questions and reflective 
contemplation.&lt;p&gt;
If you&#39;re ready, strap on that tool belt.  It is time to punch in and get to work.  
Remember, tools do not work if we are unwilling to use them.&lt;p&gt;" />
