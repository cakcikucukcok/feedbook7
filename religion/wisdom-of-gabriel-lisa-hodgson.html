  <title>Wisdom of Gabriel - Lisa Hodgson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wisdom of Gabriel&lt;/i&gt; is a book that was channeled in 2006 and is a compilation of three books in one. It has three different topics that Archangel Gabriel talks about as he is channeled by Lisa. It is an inspirational and thought-provoking book with intention to throw some light on lifes conditions. Gabriel expresses concepts that describe new ways of perceiving and understanding each topic. The three books, each covering a different topic, are Wisdom of Love, Wisdom or Children, and Wisdom of Time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wisdom of Love goes into why and how man expresses love and shows ways that one can free oneself up to love more. Wisdom of Children explains how our children are a gift to us and that they can lead us back to our God Source. Wisdom of Time explores the concept of time and how it can free us or limit us. All three books work synergistically to help us understand the human condition better. It is merely an exploration and self help book with an honest and direct style, all written with love and compassion. &lt;/p&gt;" />
