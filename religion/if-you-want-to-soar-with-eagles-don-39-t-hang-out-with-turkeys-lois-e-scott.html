  <title>If You Want to Soar with Eagles, Don&#39;t Hang out with Turkeys - Lois E. Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lois E. Scott has generated and collected pithy one-liners for the past 50 years, gems that her husband Fred refers to as LOISisms.  These one-liners can cut through the froth to the heart of a topic with wisdom, common sense, and often humor.  They may give comfort to a hurting person, or challenge a teenager as he or she struggles to deal with this world.  With these gems, she has guided and instructed three sons and eleven grandchildren and their friends.  She is now working on seven great-grandchildren.  Friends and family have enjoyed and have been challenged by her kitchen bar stool ministry.&lt;p&gt;
Hopefully, these gems will give the reader a laugh or two, or as the Christian comedian Ken Davis would say, Lighten up and live!  If you are a believer in Jesus Christ, these gems may provide some food for thought as you live your life and raise your children.  If you have not yet come to a saving relationship with the living Christ, hopefully some of these gems will challenge you to contemplate your relationship with Him, and hence your future beyond this limited time you have on this earth." />
