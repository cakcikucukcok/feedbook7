  <title>The Religion of God (Divine Love) - His Divine Eminence Ra Gohar Shahi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The excerpts from the book for quick awareness:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Those who love God but do not practise a religion are better than you if you follow a religion and yet are deprived of Gods love.&lt;br /&gt;2. Love relates to the heart. The word, Allah, when synchronised within heartbeats, reaches all veins and arteries through the blood and revives the souls. Then the souls, engulfed by Gods name, Allah, enter Gods love.&lt;br /&gt;3. All names given to God in all languages are worthy of respect. However, Gods original name is Allah, which is a word from the Suryani language. The creatures of empyrean speak this language. The angels call upon God with the name of Allah. Allah is attached with the faith declaration motto of every prophet.&lt;br /&gt;4. Any person who, with all the sincerity of heart, is in search for God, on land or in the sea, is worthy of respect.&lt;br /&gt;5. Many Adams were sent in different regions of the world simultaneously. All Adams were moulded from the clay in this world, for except the last Adam who was moulded from the clay in paradise, and is buried in the Arab region. The angels did not prostrate to any other Adam for except Adam Safi Allah. And Iblis (the Devil) developed enmity for the progeny of Adam Safi Allah only.&lt;br /&gt;6. There are seven different sub-spirits in the human skeleton, and each relates to a different realm, a different paradise, and different functions in the human body. If these sub-spirits are empowered with Gods light (Noor), they may appear in human form in many places simultaneously. They may reach the esoteric gatherings of the saints and the prophets, speak with God, and even see God in person also.&lt;br /&gt;7. There are two different types of religions for all humans: the religion for the body, which expires when the body does, and the religion for the soul, which existed even in the primordial timethat is Gods love. And only this religion elevates humans.&lt;br /&gt;8. Ishq (Rapturous Love) of Allah is above all other religions, and seeing Allah is above all forms of worship.&lt;br /&gt;9. Information on how human beings, animals, plants, and stones were brought into existence, and why something is prohibited or permissible.&lt;br /&gt;10. Who pre-existed the Amr Kun (the command Be) of the souls and the angels? Which dog will enter the paradise in form of Qatmir? The souls of which individuals had already affirmed the declaration of faith in the primordial time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret of which man is not mentioned in this book?&lt;/p&gt;" />
