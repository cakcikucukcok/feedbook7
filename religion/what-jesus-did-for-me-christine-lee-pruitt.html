  <title>What Jesus Did  for Me - Christine Lee Pruitt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was the one day I got tired of being criticized. I felt as if no one in the world was listing to a thing I was saying. I thought for a moment the only one who can hear me is God! I got tired of the family problems that I couldn&#39;t handle by myself, and it was then. I knew I needed help. Not the kind of help from a person. The help that would save me from all the aggravation, and there was nothing more I wanted was peace. I was so tired of all the commotion in the house. I needed a change. A big change! I wanted my whole life turned around for the better! The only way I knew how to do that. Was go straight to God? I went into the office in my house. I stayed in there for hours. I talked to God. I said I need a change. I can&#39;t handle this commotion going around, and the stress around me. I said God please do something for me. There is too much on my hands that I can&#39;t handle. I beg and pleaded for help! Then all the sudden I felt something wonderful. That was the moment I felt God touching my life all over again. Things started to change from better to best. Problems were being solved. That was God doing all of His work, and removing all the problems that I had in my life. I started to fellowship with God, and things have been so much dear for me, and my family! I ask God what I can do for you." />
