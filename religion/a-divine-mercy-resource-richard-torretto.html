  <title>A Divine Mercy Resource - Richard Torretto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For over twenty years, the author has researched and toured the country, giving talks, retreats, and seminars on Divine Mercy. Most of these have been given at the request of, or for, the John Paul II Institute of Divine Mercy in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, or the Life Foundation Ministries in Bernalillo, New Mexico. 
The author has found that many have not seriously read St. Faustinas diary, finding it too difficult and confusing, since it does not follow the normal diary format. Many have attempted reading other books and found them too detailed or filled with generalities. 
&lt;i&gt;A Divine Mercy Resource&lt;/i&gt; has been designed as a single resource for priests, deacons, religious instructors, and devotees of Divine Mercy. Each chapter covers one aspect of the devotione.g., the chaplet, the image, the novena, etc.and is complete with full quotes and footnotes at the bottom of each page. As a vital resource, it will further an understanding of Divine Mercy and the essential devotionals associated with it, giving priests, deacons, teachers, and laity the tools to promote the message, mission and devotion to Divine Mercy.
