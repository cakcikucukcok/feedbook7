  <title>Breaking Strongholds Thro&#39; Mid-Night Prayer - B. Mathew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you struggling in your prayer life without breakthroughs &amp; results?
 Learn what is a Mid-Night -Experience  &amp; why it brings about spectacular  results &amp; breakthroughs. 
Many sincere born again Christians pray &amp; pray, but answers &amp; breakthroughs do not come. 
Prayers which do not bring answers are NOT effective prayers.
And that&#39;s why many Christians have fallen into discouragement and have become lukewarm.  
Christians who cannot experience prayer victories normally run around to preachers, prophets and to gifted men of God for help, in a desperate hope that other people&#39;s prayers might help them.
And if answers still do not come, they sink further into despair, unbelief and spiritual darkness.
All these are about to change for you as you read this message and begin your MID-NIGHT EXPERIENCE:
 Instead, others will now come running to you for prayer &amp; deliverance
 Your disappointments will now turn to appointments
 You will now live &amp; walk in the supernatural &amp; experience prayer victories like never before." />
