  <title>Hard Knocks &amp; Consequences Too - Fred G. Dickenson, Rev. Billie Fitch, Kevin Dickenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hard Knocks and Consequences Too, by Fred G. Dickenson, is a folksy and practical walk down the path of life; it is about learning from personal experiences in ways that imprint upon ones character. Freds devotional anthology is fun to read, and it inspires the reader to reflect a little deeper into how everyday life can teach profound spiritual lessons. Whether read as a daily devotional or as a biographical journey, it will inspire any reader. I recommend Hard Knocks and Consequences Too for any believer who desires to learn how to learn from experience.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Martz, EdD, author and adult educator&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hard Knocks and Consequences Too, you are gently coaxed into mental and spiritual exercise that begins to plant principles from Gods Word, into your heart. Once you have read it, not only will more seed be planted, but you will begin to see a harvest. It will impact your life in a positive way.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missionary Wilson Gauntt, MEd, professor at Global University&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fred has a gift in assessing his lifepast and presentwith a candid approach to proving that God has a hand in everything  and he does it with an enjoyable sense of humor and humility. I recommend both books for your personal library, as a gift to a loved one in spiritual need (or not); for church libraries and ministries; and to anyone for enjoyment and a trip down memory lane.&lt;p&gt;
