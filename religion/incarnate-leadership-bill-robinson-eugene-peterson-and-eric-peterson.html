  <title>Incarnate Leadership - Bill Robinson, Eugene Peterson and Eric Peterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bill Robinson helps Christian leaders understand how to provide effective leadership by highlighting five qualities that characterized the leadership style of Jesus. He presents convincing arguments that when leaders emulate these qualities, they will inspire and empower the people they have been called to lead. Reflection and discussion questions and assessment questions make this ideal for group use.Conversational in tone and seasoned with real-life stories from his own successes and failures as a leader, Robinson helps Christian leaders wrestle with four questions that emerge from John’s introduction of Jesus, “and the word became flesh and dwelt among us….” • Jesus dwelt with those he led, how can I be closer to those I lead?  • Jesus disciples beheld him, how can I be more transparent with those I lead?  • The glory of Jesus was a reflection of his father, am I seeking my own glory?  • Jesus led with grace and truth, how can I lead with grace and truth?  The Incarnate Leader is indispensable reading for anyone in a position of leadership – whether in a church setting, corporation, school board, or home. The book is packaged as a short one-evening read, similar to other popular business books." />
