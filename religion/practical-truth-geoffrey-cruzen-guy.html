With all the things going on in your life, do you have time for God? Can He help you? Do you matter to God? &lt;br&gt;
Many people ask those questions every day. During a difficult time in his life, Geoffrey Guy sought Gods answers to all the questions in his own life. God led Geoff deep into the Bible to find the answers. The Bible is basically a blueprint for how we are to live our lives to be successful, and happy but most people dont know how to find the information. &lt;br&gt;

In these pages, you will find the answers to your questions as they relate to your life. Whether youre a veteran Christian, a new believer or someone who is just beginning to explore Christianity, the Truth has been revealed for you to see firsthand Gods love and His Divine plan for your life." />
