  <title>Goin&#39; on a Road Trip Without Any Wheels - Anna Greenlee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Adventure! We all seek it in some form or fashion. The authors adventures are best created when she seeks God in her everyday life. He turns her typical days into grand road trips, and she doesnt even need to go anywhere. 
&lt;p&gt;
Such is the case in her book &lt;i&gt;Goin on a Road Trip without Any Wheels&lt;/i&gt;. In a humorous, storytelling manner, Anna describes the adventure she shared with her family as they lived in a travel trailer while building their home. A temperamental twenty-eight foot camper named The Cougar became home for her and her husband, their two kids, and their dog for nine months. Their horse couldnt join them, she just wouldnt fit. But even without the horse, they had the journey of a lifetime. &lt;P&gt;
As she reflected on their time in The Cougar, God began to teach her some valuable spiritual lessons. Each chapter of the book tells of a funny story that unfolded while they were living in the little camper, and from that story a spiritual lesson supported by scripture begins. She has walked with God long enough to know that a life with Him is full of adventure. Her time spent in The Cougar was certainly no exception." />
