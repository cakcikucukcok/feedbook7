  <title>Vital Truth and Precepts - Felix Amiri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.afisservices.ca/synoptic.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;I&gt;Synopsis&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/A&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.afisservices.ca/FreeGuide.html&quot;&gt;&lt;I&gt;Free Study Guide&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.bookfinder4u.com/IsbnSearch.aspx?isbn=1436382920&amp;mode=direct &quot;&gt;&lt;I&gt;Additional Retailers&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;Dare to think beyond the ordinary and live above mere existence.&lt;/B&gt; 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An old hymn by William P. Merrill calls us to: rise up [&lt;I&gt;and&lt;/I&gt;] have done with lesser things [&lt;I&gt;emphasis added&lt;/I&gt;]. We must awaken to what is happening in our world and flee from folly.
Escaping the seductive embrace of worldliness requires us to be vigilant. We must shun all distractions, deception and alluring digressions. Like repentant prodigals, we need to persistently run to our Fathers protective and loving embrace. Even our temporal survival depends on this. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is a sad reality today that while many disregard God, others are misinformed about him. There is widespread digression from the truth. Each of these abnormalities leads to serious consequences. Hence, we must flee to God.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This book discusses Gods supremacy, sovereignty, and absolute attributes. Gods purpose for his creation, mankinds fall, individual culpability, Gods grace and salvation through Jesus Christ are examined. Among the key convictions conveyed is the fact that true liberation comes only from an obedient response to the transcendent supremacy and will of God. One cannot properly glorify God without a correct understanding and application of the truth. Therefore, seeking the truth is the most prudent engagement for mankind. All are called upon to appropriately respond to God. For some, this book may be the beginning of a long term exploration. For others, it may serve as the encouragement to continue in their commitment to the truth. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Vital Truth and Precepts&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; could serve as a resource for personal or group study. It provides useful teaching or study content for Sunday school teachers, as well as for professors and students in bible colleges and seminaries.  New Christians and even people who are not followers of Christ might find it helpful in understanding the Christian faith.
