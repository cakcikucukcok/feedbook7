  <title>The Anti-Christs Are Here - Ilenloa Igberaese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Comments About the Book
I find it difficult to believe one of my young lecturers who is not a pastor wrote this pice. No wonder his colleagues call him Father Francis. That is what research is all about. It sounds convincing, and I would wait to see how our numerous Men of God would react to the book that puts all of them at a defence.
- Prof. Donald Ekong (2004)
Vice Chancellor
University of The Gambia
Particularly on this tithe issue, my husband has hit the nail on the head
- Mrs. Iguehi Igberaese
This book is confrontational, but based on facts. How then would God judge this world? Does this mean that the multitude of worshipers in the church have no salvation? The author did not answer these questions.
- Engr. Glory Momodu
Voice of Nigeria
How possible will it be to preach the true gospel without being seen as confrontational?
- Evang. Robert Eikpe
Church of Christ, Benin City.
This book is set to free many people  from the bondage of those who are after their stomach, but who are masquerading as &quot;Men of God&quot;." />
