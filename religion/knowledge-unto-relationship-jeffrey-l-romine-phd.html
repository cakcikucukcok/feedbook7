  <title>Knowledge Unto Relationship - Jeffrey L. Romine, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We live in a day of advanced technology, but what lies behind it is applied knowledge. Knowledge is a sweeping term, serving as a common denominator undergirding science, philosophy, theology and the list goes on. It speaks to the condition of learnedness as opposed to merely opinion, or its absence, ignorance. Christianity is knowledge based too. Like pursuing a philosophic line of reasoning, this book engages the biblical trajectory that follows from the Tree of Knowledge. Drawing upon the great thinkers, topics such as the great debate over faith and reason, postmodernism, law in the confines of covenant, justice in the context of dominion, and the role of the Holy Spirit are addressed, distilling out key components related to knowledge, showing how the path forward leads into covenant-relationship.&lt;/p&gt;" />
