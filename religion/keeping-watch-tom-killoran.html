  <title>Keeping Watch - Tom Killoran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jesus commanded that his followers faithfully watch for his return. This command clearly implies there is something to watch for! But what exactly is that? How are we to recognize the &lt;i&gt;specific&lt;/i&gt; signs of his coming?&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;What differentiates false messiahs, wars and rumors of war, famines, pestilence, persecution and earthquakesthe signs Jesus gavefrom those same afflictions that have plagued man since the beginning? What is it that makes the period of history immediately prior to Jesus return identifiably different?&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Keeping Watch&lt;/i&gt; unveils the answer, identifying the specific signs of Jesus return and why these signs are unique to a particular event at a particular moment in history  an event already beginning to unfold!&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Keeping Watch&lt;/i&gt; clarifies the biblical precepts by which God judges people and nations. The application of these precepts to the book of Revelation reveals that the seals, the first set of seven so-called judgments, are not actually judgments at all, but rather a series of &lt;i&gt;events&lt;/i&gt; fulfilling the signs of Jesus return. When considering the signs and their fulfillments together, the story of a world-shaking conflict unfoldsa conflict that brings nations to their knees while fulfilling &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; sign Jesus gave his disciples!&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Jesus declared, When you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates. Truly, I say to you, &lt;i&gt;this generation&lt;/i&gt; will not pass away until all these things take place.&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We are that generation!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
