  <title>America and the Will of God - Carlos A. Mojica</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book examines an important issue facing America today  the increasing influence of evangelical Christians in our Federal government and the erosion in the separation between Church and State.    The election of George W. Bush secured a representative for the Christian right who was willing to effect government policies to reflect Christian values on issues such as gay marriage, stem-cell research, abortion, and others.    More significantly, the importance of securing this group of voters was not lost on any of the presidential candidates in the upcoming 2008 election.   From now on, every candidate will have to publicly express their faith and how it influences their lives and decisions.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book explores several questions posed by this shift in the balance between Church and State:    Can we derive a moral code independent of God?   Would a strong evangelical influence strengthen our government?  Are democratic principles compatible with a theocracy? And more fundamental, does God really exist?  How do we know?" />
