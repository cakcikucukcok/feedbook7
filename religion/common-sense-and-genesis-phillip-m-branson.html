  <title>Common Sense and Genesis - Phillip M. Branson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this book is to offer a logical, common sense translation of the book of Genesis. It is not written as a dogmatic statement of absolute authority, but rather it is meant as a translation that conforms to the literal writing of Genesis. I am aware that it differs widely from conventional teachings. When I first read the book of Genesis, however, I did not have the benefit of much formal religious training, so I was not influenced by the opinions and interpretations of others. From the outset I formed the theories that are stated here based on the words I read, and further study has only served to strengthen those concepts. This is what the book of Genesis says to me. I offer it as a possible alternative to the interpretations that have been handed down unquestioned and unchallenged for several hundred years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What this book is not is a work of apologetics. I have begun with the assumption that the Bible says what it means, and means what it says.&lt;/p&gt;" />
