  <title>The Short Dance - Leonidas Kolokathis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Leonidas Kolokathis met Geraldine during their last year of high school in 1988. They parted ways briefly, later reconnected, married, and had three children. They expected to enjoy their love for the rest of their lives. But in 2007, Geraldine was diagnosed with cancer, and she died two years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Short Dance&lt;/i&gt;, Kolokathis narrates the happenings of the last years of Geraldines life from the husbands perspective as he supported Geraldine and watched the whole process unfold in front of them. It offers insight into Kolokathis world and their journey into spirituality and finding their peace. It shares the rollercoaster ride of cancer and its treatment as well as the reflections of someone opening up to spirit throughout this difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A raw recollection of someone crossing over and the people left behind, &lt;i&gt;The Short Dance&lt;/i&gt; tells a story about the magic of love, soaring spiritually, and the ability to overcome tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
