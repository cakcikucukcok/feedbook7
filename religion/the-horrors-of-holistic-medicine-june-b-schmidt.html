  <title>The Horrors of Holistic Medicine - June B. Schmidt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For 16 years, the author was a patient at a clinic run by doctors associated with the American Holistic Medical Association (AHMA) who claimed to treat the whole person  body, mind, and spirit. As a Christian, this whole person philosophy initially appealed to her; however, 16 years later, she realized how completely she had been duped by their unorthodox medical practices. They had subtly brainwashed her to believe she could control her life  and her health. Their advice was not healing; it was destroying her health  body, mind, and spirit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For eight years the author was prescribed iron tablets and iron shots for a stubborn case of anemia. When she finally referred herself to a hematologist in late 1981, she learned she never had had iron deficiency anemia; she suffered from a hemolytic process  the anemia of infection and cancer. Her hematologist referred her to a gynecologist who, two weeks later, suspecting ovarian cancer, scheduled her for a hysterectomy. This surgery probably saved her life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After surgery, she thought all her physical complaints would end, but the mystery continued to deepen as new, unexplained symptoms plagued her. With the help of God and her new medical doctors, the mystery was finally resolved  another condition created by her holistic healers. 
This story is the authors personal struggle back to wholeness once she realized the harm her holistic doctors unholy practices had inflicted on her body. The journey back to health was puzzling and often depressing as she struggled through the anger and rage of being deceived by medical professionals she trusted. Only with the help of new, competent doctors and a lot of prayer was she able to achieve wellness and forgive her unscrupulous doctors.&lt;/p&gt;" />
