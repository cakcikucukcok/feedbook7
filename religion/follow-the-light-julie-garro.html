  <title>Follow the Light - Julie Garro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We know how the story begins.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now take a fresh look at Gods first recorded words.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, Let there be light, and there was light (Genesis 1:3).&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 8:12, Jesus said, I am the light of the world. This light goes on forever, just as the love of God never ends. Follow the Light links the first words God spoke in the Bible to the experiences of Gods people and the teachings of Jesus Christ.
Delve into an exploration of the Scriptures, considering all the ways that light is a metaphor for God, His Kingdom, and His infinite love. Created for individuals and small groups, Follow the Light examines Gods presence in various forms of light, and uses numerous scriptural references to show us that the presence of our Heavenly Father is all around us.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This eight-week study is divided into personal, daily assignments along with suggested prayer topics to encourage regular conversations with our Heavenly Father. The final chapter is designed as a self-reflection tool and offers suggestions to develop a rich and fulfilling prayer life.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you complete this Bible study, and contemplate on the glory of Gods Word and the vastness of His creation, you will begin to feel our Heavenly Fathers constant presence and visibility in your life.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; and there was beautiful, life-giving, and loving light.&lt;p&gt;" />
