  <title>Crazy Revolution - Hugh Barber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ALL OF HEAVEN HOLDS ITS BREATH WAITING ON YOUR DECISION TO LIVE OUTRAGEOUSLY IN FAITH. TO BE UNCOMPROMISING TO WHATEVER GOD CALLS YOU TO DO
The word CRAZY refers to passionate, zealous and devoted individuals. 
They inspire followers, challenge systems of thinking and bring a revolution.
Jesus was in every sense of the word, CRAZY. He set a new standard of living and became a revolutionary; changing the world forever.
Too many believers today are spiritually apathetic to things of God.
They have no power, influence or fruitfulness of any significant amount.
In a time of superficial faith the time has come for a CRAZY Revolution.
To make a stand in the faith no matter the cost. To turn over tables in the face of  hypocrisy. And to live the Christian faith radically. This is the Jesus way.
What does it look like to be a committed Christian? How are we to live in holiness in a dark and fallen world? And how are we to stay true to Jesus call in taking up our cross and following Him? The answers will surprise you. This book will cover the essential qualities of what it means to be a faithful follower of Christ. It will explore the key elements of what are to be our priorities and how to finish our race strong.
A revolution is rising in on the horizon of a strong and faithful army, living outrageously in faith. Much is at stake and all of heaven is awaiting your decision. Because at the end of the day, as you will soon find, youll be crazy not to be CRAZY..." />
