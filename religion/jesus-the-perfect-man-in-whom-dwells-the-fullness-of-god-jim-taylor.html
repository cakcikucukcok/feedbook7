  <title>Jesus the Perfect Man in Whom Dwells the Fullness of God - Jim Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, And this is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, even Jesus Christ (John 17:3). But the question is, how is it possible to know God? How can we know someone who is infinite and eternal when we cannot see him, feel him, hear him, or sense his presence? We see clearly from the creation that there is a God, or else this world could not exist (Romans 1:20). We know from the Bible that God is a loving Father who is the Creator of all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a way we can know God more intimately and more perfectly. We can know God by knowing his Son, the very one whom God sent to us as the Savior and redeemer of this lost worldhis name is Jesus, and he is the Almighty Jehovah God himself. We can know Jesus intimately as our best friend (John 15:15), and our brother (Hebrews 2:1114), and our Father (Isaiah 9:67; John 10:30, 14:611), because even though he is God, he became one of us exactly, a man, just like all other men (Hebrews 2:1418). He lived in this present world exactly as we live in it. So whatever we learn by studying Jesus, his teachings, and his life, we are learning about our loving Father, our God, and our Creator.&lt;/p&gt;" />
