  <title>The Life of Wulfric of Haselbury, Anchorite - John of Ford, Pauline  Matarasso</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;John of Forde&amp;#39;s &lt;I&gt;Life of Wulfric of Haselbury&lt;/I&gt; &amp;#39;priest, healer, seer, mystic, who lived in a cell abutting a village church from 1125 until his death in 1154 &amp;#39;is a classic of its kind. It portrays the daily life of the recluse, his austerities, the hours of prayer, his familiar companionship with his God, as well as his place in the community, a network of relationships stretching country-wide and friendships maintained over many years with both women and men. John, prior and later abbot of Forde, is the devoted guide opening up the treasures of his Wulfric to any who care to listen. The work, too little read or studied for want of a translation, is now made available not only to the medievalist but to anyone with an interest in the spiritual life.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
