  <title>Love Letters to God - Victoria Teran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Introduction
&lt;P&gt;Dear Child of the King,&lt;P/&gt;
&lt;P/&gt;Did you know that you were made for joy?&lt;P/&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;This book is sure to capture your interest because, we all encounter moments of splendor in our lives that leave us in awe.&lt;P/&gt;  
&lt;P&gt;I am thrilled you have chosen to open this treasure box of joys revealed.  Your responses to my experiences will be as diverse as each of you.  Some will make you cry and some will make you laugh.&lt;P/&gt;  
&lt;P&gt;You will discover that many will touch you in the heart for very personal reasons.  When that happens make a note as to why a particular one spoke to you.  By writing what was revealed to you; you will meet the true author, not just the pen.&lt;P/&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;I have loved words for as long as I can remember.  I have known the King personally since I was eleven or twelve.  Knowing someone personally and loving them can be two different things I have discovered.&lt;P/&gt;  
&lt;P&gt;This book came about when two loves collided.  My King heard a whisper of a dream in my heart, told only to Him.  All these years later He has given me the dream.  Not as I thought it would be, but as it must be to glorify Him.&lt;P/&gt;  
&lt;P&gt;This book is an expression of glory from one pen full of ink, poured out in love to the King of Kings.&lt;P/&gt;
&lt;P&gt;May it encourage and refresh you as you begin to see the great delights that await you.&lt;P/&gt;  
&lt;P&gt;Love in Christ,&lt;P/&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Victoria Teran&lt;P/&gt;
