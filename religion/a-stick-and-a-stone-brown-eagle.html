  <title>A Stick and a Stone - Brown Eagle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.  Psalm 34:18
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Sadly, love knows too well the abused, betrayed, neglected, abandoned, rejected, and cheated, just to name a few. Loves gift of joy and trust quickly
    fades. Loves flame quietly becomes a smoldering ember. Walls are built, a dark fortress within, protects a heart that breaks.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    A Stick and a Stone was written to reach out to those who are hurting. The path of life these days is not an easy road to travel. Praises lifted that we do
    not have to travel this road alone.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    I was abandoned at nine months of age, placed in Saint Vincents Orphanage, and adopted by the age of six. By the age of 14, the streets had become safer.
    Abuse had become the norm throughout life.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    A Stick and a Stone was written to help those who are hurting, broken, and crushed in spirit. My prayer is that the messages found in my writings will give
    others the same strength, hope, and love that I have found in Christ.
