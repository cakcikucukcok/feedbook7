  <title>An Outdated Gospel - Rene Caza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book makes an honest attempt to explain and clarify what many term as the way of the cross. 
The Cross understood to mean not only the form of death Jesus suffered for us but the place where believers of every age have experienced death to self- preservation, self-serving , a complete undoing of our natural carnal man. 
This is the meeting place of two wills; ours and Gods and the emergence of only one- Gods. 
I have come to do Thy will Oh my God This was the mandate that beat in the heart of Jesus; it must become ours as well. 
For decades now another gospel has been preached across the land and has conveniently set aside the Cross as some outdated piece of furniture tucked away in the attic no longer desired on the main floor. 
The hundred and one success messages and books all clamouring for our attention to be implemented into our lives have after some thirty plus years left the North American church with little more than vital signs let alone abundant life. 
We may have learned about His acts, but sadly we have not known His ways. 
His ways oftentimes lead to trials, adversity and suffering contrary to popular teaching. The vehicle that will transport us into His Presence is so often designed by God to take us via the wilderness places of His choosing. The journey begins with our entrance as spiritual infants into the Kingdom. However, where we end up and how long it takes us to mature are our choice and the consequences of our choice alone. 
This is to be sure called the narrow road, albeit narrow it is however the road that leads to our transformation into the full grown mature sons and daughters of God. This is the Hebrews 12 roadmap to remove our illegitimacy, and to be brought near to the Father Himself. There are no other roads. 
If you are tired of circling the mountains never being able to breakthrough into true communion with God, then its time to embrace the cross in your life and let it transport you into His Presence. 
There is no mystical formula that leads to life in and maturity in Christ. Our brokenness before God releases the Anointing and character of Christ so often preached but rarely manifested. 
This book will not reveal new answers or keys to help you on your journey. You will find however, Biblical truth that will ring its witness in your spirit that will be confirmed with scripture and by the Spirit of God. 
Let us all individually as well as corporately return to the Cross, may it once again be taught, embraced and lived out in the Christian Church and maybe then the glory of God will fill the House." />
