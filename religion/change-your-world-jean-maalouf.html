  <title>Change Your World - Jean Maalouf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A New Creation
Our very survival is at stake. We must change.
The references and values on which we used to depend are becoming relativized and questionable, and the true sense of integrity, responsibility, and purpose now seems outdated.  Instead, we seem to have chosen the path of shortsighted success and gratification, convenient arrangements, and sometimes the one-sided fanaticism and fundamentalism. No wonder we find ourselves in such a deep spiritual crisis that makes all other crises possible, probable, and even certain and extremely dangerous. 
Change Your World: Awakening to the Power of Truth  Beauty  Simplicity - Change is an invitation to faithfully recapture the basics, deeply rediscover the very reason for our existence, and carefully reassess our references and values. Truth will make us free. Beauty will save the world. Simplicity will help redefine our priorities. Change will transform us and will transform our world into a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17).  
This is a profoundly political book; it describes, in an original and engaging way, how to live and govern from our highest and most sacred consciousness. Therefore, do not expect politics as usual, politically correct, well-calculated, and feeling good spirituality talks. Expect rather as it is articulation, straightforward approaches, and unequivocal descriptions of the new creation values. Our survival depends on our ability to be truly human and in alignment with our most sacred consciousnessthe mind of Christ (1 Corinthians 2:16). Isnt contemplation the highest form of activity, as Aristotle suggested?
Masterfully, Dr. Maalouf uncovers the simple truths of a happy, healthy, and meaningful life, and discloses the secret of the fullness of life. A contemplative approach to life is indispensable for grasping and living the essence of what it means to be truly human." />
