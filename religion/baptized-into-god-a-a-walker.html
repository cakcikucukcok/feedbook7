  <title>Baptized into God - A.A. Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is an intriguing study on two controversial topics: baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and the oneness of God. Baptism has been a theme of contention for many centuries, yet the Biblical and historical records teach us the simplicity of this topic. The second area of fiery debate revolves around the identity of God and the monotheistic cry of the Scripture. Being both a research-oriented and scholarly publication, the reader will find themselves being challenged as they are confronted with the truth from the Bible and the witness of history, while reclining at the metaphorical table of scholarly disputation. 
This work is for the hungry heart, the academic mind, the inquisitive, lovers of the Scripture, and those with questions that need to be addressed. As the reader is challenged to explore the evidence with the author, the testimony of scholarship, and most importantly, the veracity of the Word, they will find themselves in a position calling them to respond to such discoveries. This study will trouble stagnant waters and compel the reader to consider the unequivocal GodJesus Christ." />
