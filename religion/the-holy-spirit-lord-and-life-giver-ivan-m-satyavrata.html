  <title>The Holy Spirit: Lord and Life-giver - Ivan M. Satyavrata</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is impossible to love God and at the same time be dispassionate about the study of God. Deep devotion to Jesus and an all-consuming desire to see his glory fill the earth should fuel the passion of anyone who ventures to write about God and help illuminate other people&#39;s understanding of God and his ways. Few themes call for as much of a blending of mind and heart as that of the Holy Spirit.  The global spread of Pentecostal Christianity, often in context of urban poverty, has attracted much attention. The movement highlights a hunger for the experience of God in our world and provides millions of poor believers with hope for social transformation. Yet spiritual experience needs a fully biblical understanding of the Holy Spirit with which its claims can be properly assessed.  Ivan Satyavrata provides an introduction to the Bible&#39;s teaching on vital issues and questions, many of which have been, and continue to be, a source of confusion and controversy amongst Christians. Combining scholarly enquiry with accessibility, his deep theological reflections and passion for unity will contribute to constructive dialogue and appeal to a wide readership." />
