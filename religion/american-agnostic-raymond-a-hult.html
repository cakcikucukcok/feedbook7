  <title>American Agnostic - Raymond A. Hult</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;American Agnostic&lt;/i&gt; argues that the true worth of an American should not be based on an individual&#39;s faith or uncertainty in the reality of a biblical God.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;American Agnostic&lt;/i&gt; is an atempt by author Raymond A. Hult to bridge the unfortunate gap of mistrust and disrespect that too often currently exists in America between members of the Christian majority and the agnostic minority. Hult places the responsibility for achieving a mutually respectful understanding equally on the shoulders of both those who fervently believe in the Christian God and those who are as yet still unsure. He tries to show that moral behavior is more often than not unrelated to a person&#39;s religious persuasion.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;American Agnostic&lt;/i&gt; engages Christians and agnostics in a frank discussion of the main differences of opinion that separate both groups in regard to the authenticity of the Bible and the reality of the God as presented therein. Drawing on his transformation from a devout Christina leader to a questioning agnostic, the author recounts in detail the thought process that led to his gradual change of belief. He respectively defends this change as reasonable and deserving of serious consideration. He seeks to portray the agnostic in a more favorable light and that there is nothing inherently evil with admitting that a sure knowledge of God may not be so sure after all." />
