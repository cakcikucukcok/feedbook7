  <title>Burying the Sword - Gerald Grudzen, Faith Akdogan, Martin Olando</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Burying the Sword: Counteracting Jihadism with Interfaith Education
This book analyzes the historical and political context in which various forms of violent extremism (jihadism) have emerged in the Middle East, Europe, and in Africa since 9/11/2001. The growth of the jihadism can be attributed in part to the oppressive regimes of the Middle East which have curtailed the democratic impulses of their youth.  Alternative youth movements such as we saw in the Arab Spring can serve as a source of inspiration and model for renewal of these regions. The book also analyzes the role that technology can play in organizing future youth movements and serve as part of an interfaith educational program that has already been initiated in Kenya. New models of interfaith education in public and private schools throughout Africa are needed to counteract the growth of extremist ideologies among the youth of this region." />
