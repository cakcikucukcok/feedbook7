  <title>Eric&#39;s Heart... When a Mother Grieves - John H. Gay  M.D., Laura Lynn Sargent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Journey along with mother and child as Laura Lynn Sargent shares her story about her son, Eric. Eric was ornery and silly, loving and affectionate; he was also brave. Eric was born with severe congenital heart disease. Time and again, he boldly faced medical giants and won the battle. Eventually, the disease took its toll, and Eric died when he was six.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric was precious in Gods sight. During his last heart surgery, he underwent a procedure called circulatory arrest, which left him with no heartbeat or oxygen for just short of an hour. Three weeks later, Eric told his mommy about going to heaven. In heaven, he had a new body without scars. He also described the four living creatures around the throne of God and the noise they made, but he wouldnt describe God. He said, Youre not supposed to know.  In 2 Corinthians 12:14, Paul describes a similar visit to heaven, where he heard inexpressible things, things no one is supposed to tell.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;[&gt;Eric died of heart failure five months after his last surgery. Losing Eric left a gaping hole in Lauras heart. The road to healing was long and exhaustive; over time and little by little, Gods comfort and compassion gently wiped away her tears.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;God put a call on Lauras life to write Erics storyher storymore than thirty years ago. Being a recent empty-nester, her home is quiet for the first time in thirty-eight years. Thus, a perfect scenario to write Erics Heart  When a Mother Grieves.&lt;p&gt;
