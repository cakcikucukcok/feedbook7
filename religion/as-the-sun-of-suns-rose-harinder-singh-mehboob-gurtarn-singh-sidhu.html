  <title>As the Sun of Suns Rose - Harinder Singh Mehboob, Gurtarn Singh Sidhu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the Sun of Suns Rose: The Darkness of the Creeds Was Dispelled is the first of the eight books of Sehje Rachio Khalsa of Harinder Singh Mehboob, who had written it in a revealed and metaphysical approach after a continuous meditative study for thirty to thirty-five years of world religions, prophets, philosophy, history, psychology, mythology, world folklore, and the different forms of literature as the world epic, divine poetry, fiction, drama, and different types of prose of the elite genius of the world. In this large book, the poet/writer raises so many questions about the decline of world religions with the passage of time, the concept of pure history, the concept of death, the concept of greater holy war, the concept of pure nature, the concept of ecstasy (vismad), the concept of eternal victory, etc. In this book, he describes the answer to the above questions in detail in the most convincing ways. In this worlds history of more than four thousand years, this book can be compared only with very few books that are authorized as distinctive classics as the Bezels of Wisdom by Ibn al-Arabi, The Awakening of Faith by Ashav Ghousha, Kashful Majub by Data Ganj Hujbiri, etc." />
