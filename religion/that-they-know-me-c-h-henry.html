  <title>That They Know Me - C. H. Henry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Charlene Henry had such an overwhelming spiritual hunger that she walked away from a successful career at the height of the economic slowdown just so that she could spend all of her time seeking a more intimate relationship with Jesus. Over the course of the next two years, Jesus rewarded her by frequently awakening her during the night to explain, in dreams and visions backed with scriptural references, the simplicity of the Gospel.  She dutifully copied these visions in book form, and they are now being used around the world in Bible studies, prison ministries, and classes for new believers.  The scriptures flow effortlessly from one subject to the next, and tie the whole New Testament together.
You will learn how you can develop a personal relationship with Jesus, how you can distinquish God&#39;s voice from other voices, how to understand ten basic spiritual principles, and the six steps to praying more effectively.  You will also discover your own particular spiritual gift and how to develop it.  Prepare to have every area of your life radically transformed by this teaching!
C. H. Henry is also the author of another book that highlights &quot;snapshots&quot; of Jesus from Genesis to Revelation, and one that extolls God&#39;s perfect love for you." />
