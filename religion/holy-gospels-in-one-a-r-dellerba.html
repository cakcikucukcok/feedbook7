  <title>Holy Gospels in One - A.R. Dellerba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Holy Gospels in One (GIO) is a &amp;quot;Word for Word&amp;quot; narrative of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John combined into a single chronological account of the events of Jesus Christ from 5 B.C. to 31 A.D. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is unique about this narrative is that while most harmony narratives reinterpret Gospel events based on doctrinal bias, the Holy Gospels in One is a direct analytical translation of the four Gospels from the Greek Received Text (1550 A.D. Stephanus Text) in one chronological read. It captures all the details concerning the events from the Gospel writers, even to the smallest word. This saves time for the avid Bible student, who flips back and forth across the Gospels, looking at the different insights from the Greek Text. Some additional features include: colour codes and verse references, that make it easy to cross reference every word or phrase to the Greek Text; deviations from the Greek text are italicized; Jesus&amp;#39; spoken words are underlined; and textual commentaries, maps and charts are uniquely constructed for this narrative - all leading to a dynamic and enriched Bible study experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The objective is to help provide a contextual flow of events and to dispel cries of error or &amp;quot;so-called&amp;quot; contradictory Gospel passages, such as the demon-possessed men/man at Gadarenes/ Gergesene, the blind man/men that Jesus healed at Jericho, the fig tree that Jesus cursed which shrivelled up the same day/following day, and Mary the Magdalene&amp;#39;s appearance with/without the other women at the Tomb, and others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An example of the four Gospels in one:&lt;br&gt;(Matt. 27:35-44, Mark 15:24-32, Luke 23:33-43, John 19:18-27): And when they came onto the place called Skull, there they crucified Him and two others, two robbers, criminals, together with Him. One on this side from His right and one on that side from His left, now Jesus in the middle. Now it was the third hour (9 a.m.) and they crucified Him. And the Scripture was fulfilled which said, &amp;quot;And He was considered with the lawless&amp;quot; (Is. 53:12). Now Jesus said, &amp;quot;Father, forgive them, for indeed they do not know what they do.&amp;quot; Therefore when the soldiers crucified Jesus (Him), they took and divided His garments and made four parts, cast a lot on them, to determine what each one should take." />
