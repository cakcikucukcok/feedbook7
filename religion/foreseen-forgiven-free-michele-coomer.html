  <title>Foreseen.Forgiven.Free. - Michele Coomer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;foreseen.forgiven.FREE&lt;i&gt;, author and speaker Michele Coomer recounts the tragic story of her painful past and her journey to freedom. This book serves as an interactive study. As Michele shares the biblical truths that God revealed to her on her journey and relates her own personal story, she will also guide you on your own journey to freedom. This book takes a look at some of the many places in Scripture where God shows us He is the one who breaks our chains and grants us freedom to live the life He intended for us to live. The events in our lives were foreseen by the Creator of the universe. In all things we are forgiven, and Christ is the only way to that forgiveness. It is in Christ alone that freedom can be obtained. Don&#39;t delay any longer. Freedom is waiting.&lt;p&gt;" />
