  <title>In the Twinkling of His Eye - Peachey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;LARGE PRINT EDITION&lt;b/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible says, in I Thessalonians 5:3 (KJV), &quot;For when they shall say, peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.&quot; &lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people are going about their daily lives, a suddenly event will take place that will engulf and cause great sorrow for the human race. An event never dreamed of will strike. One day you will open the door, and everything will end, changing you for all time. You will be stepping into the future, as your past will be gone. The Holy Spirit gave me a vision of a coming event that will transform all of mankind.&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prepare me for this future event, I experienced an encounter with God at the age of sixteen. This was not something a person would seek out or plan to happen, but the Lord God Almighty came into my room one night, and fear and respect for him entered into my being.&lt;p/&gt;" />
