  <title>Kids Don&#39;t Build Boats - Lorraine M. Plante, David E. Plante</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;The early 1940s werent easy years for America or the world at large. Jacob was just a young boy in New Hampshire when World War II broke out. His father was sent away to fight faceless monsters, while Jacob and his remaining family moved in with his grandparents. It was easy living with his grandparents, despite his mothers worry that something might happen to Jacobs father. One day, though, Jacobs father came home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;The family moved into their own home, and just like the rest of America, had to adjust to war-caused austerity. It wasnt easy for young Jacob. He discovered that although he occasionally brought out the best in people, he was more likely to bring out the worst. All he wanted was his freedomfreedom to ride his bike, get a job shoveling snow, and even build a boat for his father, despite his fathers misgivings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;Kids Dont Build Boats follows young Jacob from a precocious child to a troubled teen. The church was always in the background, as Christ loved Jacob, despite his misbehavior. Jacob was lucky to have an everlasting friend through his tumultuous times, and like Noah with the ark, Jacob found a purpose and eventual peace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
