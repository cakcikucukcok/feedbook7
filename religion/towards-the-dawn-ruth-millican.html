  <title>Towards the Dawn - Ruth Millican</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;Towards the Dawn&#39; is a book which has grown gradually over a long period of time and comes out of a lifetime of reading the New Testament.  On reading through the gospels it becomes obvious that a large number of people from very different walks of life met Jesus during the years of his earthly ministry, but we are given only a few details about each one.  
	It is intriguing to think about how different people responded to Jesus.  What did they all think about him?  Were their lives changed by their encounters?  What were their feelings about Jesus and his teachings?  Did different people have very different reactions?  These are the main questions behind this book.  
	The gospels show very clearly that an encounter with Jesus changed a person&#39;s life.  Some lives were radically changed, others were not sure about Jesus and some were antagonistic towards him.  In the light of the whole Bible, a number of different genres are used in this book to explore ideas and bring a variety of characters to life." />
