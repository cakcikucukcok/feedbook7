  <title>Nice People Rob God - Althea Patrick Rn Msn Lnc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Will a person rob God?  Yes however, nice people have robbed themselves by selecting not to be a cheerful giver (Malachi 3:6). Nice people will lean toward just hearing Gods word, where as effective Christians become an active listener and a doer of Gods word. Do you know by attempting to rob God you are really robbing your self from living life more abundantly? Many are call to the altar of salvation but only a few are chosen to pick up the cross and follow Him. The test of your faith for some is not at the altar of salvation it is after leaving the benediction. Nice people suffer from under use of faith, and as a result they suffer from undeveloped faith, and insufficient good works. The purpose in faith building is so you can produce good works. We rob God when we do not produce good works according to the development of the measure of faith God has given you. Seeking first the kingdom of heaven is an opportunity for you to come to know Gods plan and purpose concerning your life. Jeremiah 29: 11 works as a Global Positioning System in seeking the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness. Robbing God should no longer be an option nor a life style for nice people. Hence, living life for Christ becomes the only effective way of living. Nice people are often consumed with the things of this world rather then a consumer of the things of God.  As a result they have robbed God by not feeding their spirit after salvation with heavenly substance that can only be found through seeking the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With men this is impossible: but with God all things are possible. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 19:26, (KJV)&lt;p&gt;" />
