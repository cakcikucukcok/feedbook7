  <title>Who Is Jesus Christ - Abraham Howard Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book contains the complete story of the Lord Jesus Christ: AKA The Word of God. In this book certain proofs are presented that He was with God (the Father) when the heaven and earth were created, and that He is the eternal light of the heaven(s). He created all things and the worlds. Mankind (male and female) is his special creation, and angels are created spirits watching over the welfare of mankind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was O Lucifer, the great dragon, that old serpent, called the Devil and Satan who brought sin into the earth and caused the deaths of Adam and Eve. Angels left heaven to live on the earth during Noahs time. O Lucifer started war in heaven, and in defeat was confined to the earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ Jesus was a close friend of the prophet Abraham, Moses, Elijah, and the prophets of the Old Testament. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is truly the Savior of mankind, the only begotten son of the true and living God. He is the great prophet, for He revealed to us the past, present and impending future. He came and left this earth on a prophetic time table. He is our Passover from death into everlasting life. He is the resurrection of the dead (both good and evil). He is the baptizer of the Holy Ghost (the Spirit of God), and He will judge the works of mankind to include spirit beings (angels).&lt;/p&gt;" />
