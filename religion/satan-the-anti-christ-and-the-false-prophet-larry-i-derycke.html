  <title>Satan the Anti-Christ and the False Prophet - Larry I. DeRycke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anti-Christ Defined
I feel that it is important to understanding Satan that we define just what is meant by the word anti-Christ.  The word Christ is obvious, it refers to the Savior, the son of God, the God of Creation.
The English word anti means, to be against, or in opposition to.  The problem is that the word anti as used in the Bible is Greek in its origin, and therefore has a definition with more meaning than the English word.  In the Bible Concordance anti-Christos, is defined as: False Christ, Substitute for Christ, Opposite of, reverse, neutralizing, antagonistic.
Therefore, the anti-Christ is someone or something that makes you think they are Christ, through false representation, and substitution.  This can be illustrated in the Bible with the following verses.
The purpose of this book is to reveal Gods True Word, to all who seek to know Gods Truth." />
