  <title>Opening the Pandora’S Box of Religion - Anthony Joseph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Opening Pandoras Box is an essay inspired by the horrible deeds of terrorists on 9/11 2001. It is a personal investigation into the nature of the worlds great religions, their positive and negative traits. The authors conclusion is that of the three or four most influential spiritual geniuses of the last four thousand years would include Krishna, Moses, Buddha, and Jesusthose that had spiritually developed adherents, especially in meditation, urged their students to become like them, rather than simply follow a belief system. These teachers gave their students, at whatever level of development, exercises to lessen and evaporate their ego consciousness and eventually to become one with the universe or Godor any word you wish to apply. I think Jesus did teach this also, but early Christianity turned away from it to become an institution and to seek converts. Unquestionably, an institution can do great spiritual good in regards to outreach, but mystical developments must come from a one-on-one teacher basis. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The farther away from this oneness goal, the more likely to be mistaken about it since the larger the ego, the more self-oriented it will be and the more likely it will be wrongnot only about the goal itself, but also about the process.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Being simply a student, I am talking about these things as a student and urge my readers to investigate all this for themselves.
