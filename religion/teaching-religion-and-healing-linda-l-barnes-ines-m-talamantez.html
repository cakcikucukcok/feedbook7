  <title>Teaching Religion and Healing - Linda L. Barnes, Ines M. Talamantez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This volume is designed to help instructors incorporate discussion of healing into their courses and to encourage the development of courses focused on religion and healing. It brings together essays by leading experts in a range of disciplines and addresses the role of healing in many different religious traditions. The primary target audience comprises faculty in religious studies, divinity schools, anthropology, sociology, and ethnic studies. However, the volume also addresses the needs of educators training pre-med students and will be an invaluable resource for those involved in educating physicians, health care professionals, and chaplains, particularly in relation to what is referred to as cultural competence - the ability to work with multicultural and religiously diverse patient populations." />
