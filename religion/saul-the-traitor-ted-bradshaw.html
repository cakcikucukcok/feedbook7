  <title>Saul – the Traitor! - Ted Bradshaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Story: We know next to nothing of the man Saul of Tarsus. Sauls home was Tarsus. He was a Jew and proudly a Pharisee. More importantly, he was a zealot. He studied under the great rabbi Gamaliel. We know nothing of his father, not even his name, except he was a Roman citizen. Since Sauls living came from tent-making, we can speculate that his father was a tent-maker
I have endeavored to recreate Sauls early life and experiences on the basis of what we do know from the scriptures and from first-century Jewish culture. To this are added logical suppositions. This is a fictionalized history of Saul up to the beginning of his ministries to the Gentiles, when he became the Apostle Paul.
The book introduces Sauls family and presents a theory of why Scripture is silent about them.
Its narrative explores his early developing of zeal for the Law.
It suggests early romance and why Saul never married.
It explores his early training under the great Rabbi Gamaliel.
It shows Sauls growing hatred of Christians and his zeal at persecuting them.
It examines Sauls conversion and the changed and disruptions that entails.
It speculates his being in the school of Christ during three years in Nabatean desert.
It follows Saul in his first evangelistic ventures.
It looks into his tentative approach to the Disciples of Jesus.
It speculates on initial meetings and development of relationships with Barnabus and Silas.
It explores some of the chastisements Saul received as a result of preaching the Gospel." />
