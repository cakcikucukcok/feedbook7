  <title>A Legacy of Wisdom - Clara Molina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The purpose of A Legacy of Wisdom is to enrich the lives of Christian women by enabling them to gain spiritual wisdom and encouragement from the examples of biblical women who touched the lives of the great biblical men of God as well as the Lord Jesus Christ. The Christian women featured in this book are excellent examples of faith and character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As partners to men like Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Samuel, King David, King Solomon, the Apostle Paul, and our great Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, they were real women who left a legacy of faith. They showed us how the presence of God guided their everyday lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the partnership each of these women had with God and with the great men featured in this guidebook will enhance your everyday life as you deal with decision-making, joy, sorrow, your personal walk with God, and everyday family life. Through the lives of these women, God provided us with valuable examples of good and bad decisions that produced good and bad consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using A Legacy of Wisdom as a guide, women can learn from the examples set by these inspiring women and apply those lessons learned to develop a stronger relationship with Jesus Christ and live righteously.&lt;/p&gt;" />
