  <title>Logizomai: A Reasonable Faith in an Unreasonable World - Kyle McDanell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Logizomai is the Greek word meaning to reckon, or to reason. The Apostle John identifies Jesus as the Logos (John 1:1, 14)-the Divine Word. To most Christians in the West today, Christianity is nothing more than a duty, a feeling, a name badge, or something one does on Sunday&#39;s. But Christianity is more than that. Christianity is a complete worldview that makes sense of the world. A right theology results in a right understanding of the world and the gospel is that right theology. The Church is sick because she is shallow. What we need is a logizomai faith-a reasonable faith. Such a reasonable faith encounters hardships with perseverance, animosity with love, and evangelism with Spirit-filled skill. Most refuse to share their faith because they don&#39;t understand it and are unable to articulate it. If Christianity is logizomai, then the issues we face today present no real challenge. We must, therefore, learn to apply the truths of the gospel to our dying, hurting world. To do so, we must have reason, rooted in the gospel and inspired by the cross." />
