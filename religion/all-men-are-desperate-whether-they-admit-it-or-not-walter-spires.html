  <title>All Men Are Desperate Whether They Admit It or Not - Walter Spires</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All Men Are Desperate Whether They Admit It or Not is a book about men for men that takes us on a&amp;nbsp;three part journey through our lives. &amp;nbsp;The Journey Into Desperate Places, Part One, examines the lives of five men - an addict, a prisoner, a rich man, a pastor, and a businessman. &amp;nbsp;First we examine common denominators that exist between their lives and ours. Then we look at the &amp;#39;roads&amp;#39; that took them to their desperate places&amp;nbsp;as a result of bad decisions. We close out this first part by looking at&amp;nbsp;&amp;#39;toll roads&amp;#39; in a new light. &amp;nbsp;There are two - My Way and God&amp;#39;s Way. &amp;nbsp;Both lead to the foot of the cross of Christ, which takes us to Part Two of the book, The Journey Through the Cross. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here we sit in on two trials - (1)&amp;nbsp;the trial of mankind and (2) your trial before God. &amp;nbsp;We learn the desperation of God through the messages and meanings of the Cross, perhaps&amp;nbsp;the most feared&amp;nbsp;implement of death ever created. Finally, we arrive at a crisis of decision. &amp;nbsp;The decision we make either leaves us in a desperate place -&amp;nbsp;sitting at the foot of the Cross - or it leads us &amp;#39;through the Cross&amp;#39; to the special place God has waiting for you. It is here He encourages and equips us for the Journey Home, Part Three.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This final part is subtitled, The Call to Desperate Living. &amp;nbsp;We revisit that amazing transformation process of the caterpillar to a butterfly and compare each step with the work God does in the lives of Christian men who submit to His will and lay ours aside. &amp;nbsp;We drill down on lessons we learn from that process. &amp;nbsp;We examine five &amp;#39;evidences&amp;#39; that provide proof that a man is committed to living desperately. &amp;nbsp;Finally, we revisit the five men with whom the book began and see how their lives turned out. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Each chapter contains questions that challenge&amp;nbsp;the reader and cause him to consider each lesson relative to his own life. &amp;nbsp;This section also facilitates small group discussion. &amp;nbsp;The book closes with a challenge to all men that &amp;quot;your life matters to God&amp;quot; and provides an outline to develop a &amp;#39;Mini-plan&amp;nbsp;for Desperate Living&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
