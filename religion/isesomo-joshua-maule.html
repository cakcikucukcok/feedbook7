  <title>Isesomo - Joshua Maule</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Democratic Republic of Congo is a country ravaged by two civil wars, tribalism, nepotism and the undeniable hardship of daily life. This is the context of the life and ministry of Bishop Muhindo Isesomo and this book tells the remarkable story of his humble, yet bold proclamation of the Good News of Jesus in the jungles of eastern Congo. Born into a life of loincloths, Isesomo, in the midst of a hedonistic and wild youth had a radical conversion to Christ that set him on a path of sharing the gospel at every opportunity and transforming the lives of those God put in front of him. Without ever seeking higher office or power, but serving with integrity and faithfulness, he was consecrated as Bishop of North Kivu and entrusted with unifying a diocese that had seen years of social and political unrest. Based on extensive interviews and research, Joshua Maule masterfully tells this true story of a modern hero of the faith. Isesomo continues to declare God’s glory to all who will listen; may this book encourage others to follow his example." />
