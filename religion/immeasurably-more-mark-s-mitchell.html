  <title>Immeasurably More - Mark S. Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Open your Bible and prepare to learn how God is able to do immeasurably more than all we can ask or imagine (Ephesians 3:20). Beloved teacher Ray Stedman takes you on a journey through Gods Word that will both inspire and motivate you. The theme of this book, the believers riches in Christ, becomes clearly evident as Immeasurably More leads you through portions of the Old and New Testamants in an easily-read, easily-grasped devotional experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God says to his people, You are to be holy to me because I, the Lord, am holy. I have set you apart to be My own. (Lev 20:26). Christians must understand that we are the people of God today. What God said to Israel He also says to us, for in our relationship in Jesus Christ there is but one man, one body in Christ. Promises which appear in the Old Testament belong also to us who live this side of the cross.&lt;/p&gt;" />
