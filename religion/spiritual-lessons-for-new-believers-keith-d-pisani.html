  <title>Spiritual Lessons for New Believers - Keith D. Pisani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Spiritual Lessons for New Believers is a four-session study guide designed to help new believers grow. As the new believers first phase of follow-up, Spiritual Lessons for New Believers introduces the new convert to the basics of Christianity. The four sessions include the reading content of instructive opening paragraphs, fill-in-the-blank questions, matching, some memorization, and some writing. The minimal qualifications needed to use the follow-up materials, as a discipler, are as follows: the discipler must himself be a believer and the discipler must be able to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filled with Scripture, the lessons in this inter-active book include studies on the new believers Faith in Jesus Christ, Life in Jesus Christ, Walk with Jesus Christ, and his Fellowship with Christ and His People. Topics covered include: A review of the salvation experience, Assurance, Scripture memorization, Spiritual growth, Prayer, The Bible, Witnessing, Living the Christ-life, The Lords return, Guarding against temptation, Church attendance, Baptism, The Lords Supper, Church Membership, and Fellowship with other believers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As an introductory study guide, Spiritual Lessons for New Believers flows into two other discipleship books by Keith D. Pisani: The second phase content study manual: Spiritual Lessons for Growing Believers which provides two transition studies: Baptism class and membership class, 26 A to Z sessions on topics from Assurance to Zeal, and two discipler training sessions. The authors fill-in-the-blank, companion workbook Spiritual Lessons for Growing Believers Workbook should be used with the A to Z content manual. A fourth book in this series is Jesus Loves Me: A Follow-Up Guide for Children. All four books are published by WestBow Press.&lt;/p&gt;" />
