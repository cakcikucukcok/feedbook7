She loves laughing, running, cookie dough, adventures, and most of all, her husband and her twin boys. As the former Assistant Principal of the Year for Alabama, she has served as guest and keynote speaker for numerous seminars and workshops. Her inspirational anecdotes encourage audience members to appreciate the tough times, to savor the good times, and to constantly seek Gods purpose in all of lifes experiences. A fervent list-maker and a self-proclaimed low-maintenance girl, Janice lives by the motto, Faith, family, friends, and fun. This is her first publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of us travels a unique and personal path along lifes journey. It can be marvelous and messy, fantastic and frightening, pleasant and painful. But what matters most is that through every twist and turn, in every dark valley and on every glorious mountaintop, God is there, holding us up, forgiving us, loving us. Underneath the Tapestry is a personal memoir of how Gods grace, faithfulness, mercy, and eternal love are revealed in both the big and seemingly small occurrences of daily life. Author Janice Stockman shares her most treasured and in-your-face Jesus moments and reveals the challenges along her journey to living a life that matters. Her inspiring words remind us to hold fervently to the hand of God and trust Him to perfectly weave the beautiful tapestry of our own incredible life story&lt;/p&gt;" />
