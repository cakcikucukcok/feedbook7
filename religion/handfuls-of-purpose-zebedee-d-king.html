  <title>Handfuls of Purpose - Zebedee D. King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Any season of life is the right season for love and purpose.
Ladies, are you frustrated with going-nowhere relationships? &quot;What am I doing wrong?&quot;, you may be asking yourself. Are you waiting on God for the man of your dreams? What does it take to position yourself for Mr. Right? Are you tired of the Game? Then it is time to follow the Plan, Gods Plan for relationships--the Plan that leads to purpose. 
The book, &quot;Handfuls of Purpose&quot;, takes the reader on a journey through various seasons in the lives of three ordinary peopleRuth, the widow from Moab, Naomi, the matriarch of Elimelechs household and Boaz, the wealthy landowner from Bethlehem-judah. While each has his/her own set of circumstances to navigate in order to fulfill Gods purpose in their individual lives, by the end of the book, the reader discovers how the destinies of these three coalesce and reveal an extraordinary, composite Divine plan greater than each could have realized on his/her own. 
Find out how Ruth redefined herself by leaving her old life and in doing so, seized an opportunity for new life, a new love and a new legacy. Follow Naomis tearful journey which, although oftentimes fraught with tragedy and perplexity, eventually culminated in a rediscovered purpose and renewed hope. Note the steadfastness of the humble husbandman Boaz and how the traits that he had developed through a lifetime of patient maturation helped him to become the best choice as a husband to Ruth as well as a fitting heir to an enduring legacy.
This book will not only delight you with its simple narratives, but it will also challenge with its poignant, hearty commentary and inspire you with its deep spiritual insights. Aditionally, many readers will be able to relate to the amazing testimony at the end of the book (Section 5).
&quot;Handfuls of Purpose&quot; is A MUST READ for mothers, daughters, friends, girlfriends, best friends, aunties, nieces; single and married who desire to have successful relationships that honor God and promise a lifetime of peace and purpose.
