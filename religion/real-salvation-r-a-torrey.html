  <title>Real Salvation - R. A. Torrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My subject to-night is the first question that God ever asked of man. You will find that question in Gen. 3:9, &amp;ldquo;Where art thou?&amp;rdquo; God asked the question of Adam. Adam had sinned, and on the evening of that awful day of the first sin the voice of God in its majesty was heard rolling down the avenues of the Garden of Eden. Adam had often heard God&amp;rsquo;s voice before, and the voice of God had been the sweetest music to Adam up till this day. Adam knew no greater joy than that of glad communion with his Creator and his Heavenly Father. But now all was different, and as the voice of God was heard rolling through the Garden, Adam was filled with fear, and tried to hide himself. That is the history of every son of Adam from that day till this. When sin enters our hearts and our lives we seek to hide from God. Every sinner is trying to hide from the presence and the all-seeing eye of God. That accounts for a very large share of the scepticism and infidelity and the agnosticism and atheism of our day. It is sinful man trying to hide from a holy God." />
