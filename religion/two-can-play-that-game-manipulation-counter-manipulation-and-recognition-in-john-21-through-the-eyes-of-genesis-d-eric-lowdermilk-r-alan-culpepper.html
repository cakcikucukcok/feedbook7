  <title>Two Can Play That Game: Manipulation, Counter-Manipulation, and Recognition in John 21 through the Eyes of Genesis - D. Eric Lowdermilk, R. Alan Culpepper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John 21 portrays seven disciples fishing all night yet catching nothing. In the morning, a shoreline stranger instructs them to recast their net. Surprisingly, the disciples fail to recognize him. After a miraculous catch and subsequent breakfast, however, there is no doubt as to who this stranger is. Jesus then questions Peter about his love and commissions him to feed Jesus&#39; sheep. Using narrative criticism, Lowdermilk examines this recognition scene, asking, &quot;How would a reader, well acquainted with recognition and deception as portrayed in Genesis, understand John 21?&quot; He discards &quot;trickster&quot; terminology and argues that biblical recognition occurs within a context of &quot;manipulation.&quot; After proposing a detailed taxonomy of manipulation, he ventures further and argues for patterns in Genesis where manipulators are &quot;counter-manipulated&quot; in a reciprocal manner, ironically similar to their own behavior, providing a transforming effect on the manipulator. These findings, plus a careful examination of Greek diminutives, inform Lowdermilk&#39;s new reading of John 21:1-19. Peter withholds his identity as a disciple in John 18 and later Jesus actively withholds his identity in ironic counter-manipulation, mirroring Peter&#39;s denials. Jesus&#39; threefold questioning of Peter continues the haunting echoes of Peter&#39;s earlier denials. Will it result in a disciple transformed?" />
