  <title>My Life, My Faith, My Journey - Monica D. McGowan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a young girl growing up in southeast Georgia, she couldnt wait to graduate high school, if not for anything but, to no longer have to go to church. Monica was eager to experience a world that she had only heard of but, was forbidden to take part in because of her mothers Christian values. She became tired of hearing all the fun that the other girls had over the weekend while all she did was attend school and church. Her desire to go to a football game, a club or maybe on a date, grew tremendously and all she dreamed about was getting out of her parents house. &lt;br&gt;
She finds herself in the hands of a repeated rapist and murderer and now its no longer her mothers faith but, her faith that will be put to the test.&lt;br&gt;" />
