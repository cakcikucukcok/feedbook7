  <title>My Dragonfly - Kathy Zengolewicz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family, relationships, loss, and grief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dealing with changes throughout life in our own way, through faith and spirituality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you lose a child, the world stands still. The birds no longer sing, the sun no longer shines. You feel as though you are alone, even in a room full of people. Grief is a terrible five-letter word. It s easier to climb a mountain than to get past grief unscathed. Kathy deals with the grief and with the loss that was the cause of the grief. She has learned to live with the grief but under her terms. &lt;strong&gt;It is her passionate hope this book can shed some light on the ways that you can conquer grief, kick it to the curb, and create a new life filled with love, peace, and joy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathy and her husband have been married since 1970. They have raised five children: a police officer, a fireman, a master plumber, and an accountant. One son is in spirit. They have five grandchildren and one great-grandson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Dragonfly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Dragonfly represents the son they lost to drug addiction in September of 2012. Kathy has written My Dragonfly to help others who have lost children, to let them know that their life matters, and to help them find the healing they need to feel whole again. If this book helps just one person or one mother who has lost a child, then it was well worth writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to live a conscious life has helped Kathy to move toward her goals of manifesting her true life path and helping others who may be searching for meaning in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
