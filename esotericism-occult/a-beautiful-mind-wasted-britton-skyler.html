  <title>A Beautiful Mind Wasted - Britton Skyler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;A Beautiful Mind Wasted&lt;/B&gt; is a compelling poetic narrative that explores the last five years of young Britton Hawkins&#39; life. In the beginning the author introduces himself and his purpose by explaining his back ground and his interests. But this isn&#39;t your average story of a young kid growing up and surviving on the tough streets of an overly impoverished area. In fact it is the opposite. Imagine if you will, &quot;The fresh prince gone wrong.&quot; Through A Beautiful Mind Wasted the audience can relive the psyche of a young man who was raised the right way, but chose the wrong path. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The reader will experience a tremendous variety of emotions and relatable experiences during his journey, but the prize is in the completion of the story. The narration will place you into a movie like drama, while the poetry will erupt your senses like a Speilberg film. This book embodies the thought process of the latest generation known to man, GENERATION X. Although the story is told through a very hip-hop like swagger the intelligence and philosophies of Hawkins propels him into visionary status. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A Beautiful Mind Wasted bridges the gap between the young and wild, and the wise and the mature. Although this book is Hawkins&#39; debut as an author he demonstrates a very seasoned style capable of changing the face of the literary world as we know it today. This story alone embodies the potential to launch a new age literary renaissance of young thinkers, creators and philosophers. Embark on a great read that will help you find the warmth within, while experiencing the excruciating reality of a cold harsh world. &lt;/P&gt;" />
