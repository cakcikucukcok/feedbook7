  <title>God Calling - Lilith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is intended to expand and encompass a vast, universal overview of Gods current relationship to his children now living on earth today.
The incarnate entities who inspire my writings have dedicated their entire lifetimes working for the sole purpose of helping mankind. Each of them has added enormously, in their own unique ways, to the very existence of this book.
I have asked the publishers to bear with me as I tread the unfamiliar waters of a writers gauntlet. Mostly though, I know it is Gods will that I impart his vital messages for you at this most critical time on earth.
It is with that assurance and inner knowing that I can state my inexorable intentions and pledge to spend my life imparting the messages God has for us all.
As we persevere, we will find a better, brighter future in the kind of world GodOD originally intended for us when we truly believe in him and his only son, our Lord Jesus.
On behalf of all of us, from both sides of the veil, be vigilant, be strong, believe.
Thank you!
