  <title>The Absorption of the Christ Through Poetry - Dr. Patricia Sadler Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Absorption Of The Christ Through Poetry&lt;/i&gt; emerged as a result of my contemplating the profound intricacy of the novel that I wrote in 2010, entitled The Absorption Of The Christ. Through poetic means, I summarize in simple brevity, if you will, my convictions relative to the Christ consciousness which I believe to be the true nature of man. I decided to give the reader another version of the novel, another means of grasping or exploring what I deem as the truth. That is to say, God is on earth in the outpicturing of physical, human form. My premise that God is all that exists is also the same theme as presented in my novel. This poetic delivery of my confessions and beliefs may enlighten some readers after having read the novel and may encourage others to utilize the poems as a means to enhance their understanding of the novel. Some may prefer one or the other or both. Of course, the ultimate choice is left up to the reader. Some enjoy novels because they are more detailed and to the point while others opt to cut to the chase to avoid lengthy storytelling and long, drawn-out stories of epic proportions. However, both of these productions may be employed in conjunction with each other for total comprehension. Both accounts express the consciousness of a narcoleptic who rationalizes that the consciousness of God is endlessly in expression and that whatever is believed by the world exists in that consciousness alone. Please note that all of the poems in question are comprised of rhythm and rhyme but are presented in the form of sentences with the flavor of succinct essays which have their stories to tell. Please remember that as a reader of this material, your consciousness will dictate the manner in which the material is received. So, take the journey and know that you are definitely in charge of the direction that you choose. Further, when you are done with your reading, observe the changes within." />
