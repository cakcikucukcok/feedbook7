  <title>Echoes of a Vision of Paradise Volume 3 - Frank Scott, Nisa Montie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Volume 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wonder how a creature can sense the presence of the Creator? Can someone so far removed truly be so near? Is there a way to become cognizant of Gods imprint in His creature, how He makes Himself known and established in heart and mind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would happen if that nearness were possible? The answer is found in the following statement: I am aware that I am aware that I can find a clear appearance of God (His image and beauty) in my Soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To realize, and thus to Know and understand, comes from a shift in how we treat our inner Selves, a change of heart, core, and essence. We thus come to comprehend that we were created to manifest the Creator, using attributes that express and attest to that station!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From time to time, a Manifestation of the Creator comes to town, that is, in human form upon the Earth. He dispenses the information required for changes that sets the stage for the way we should livemodifications in the collective and individual design. Our mind-world, sense-perceived constructs run contrary to life and are lacking the ingredients for a complete delivery of both a successful, collective narrative within our planetary system of intelligent life and, as individuals, the changes that bring about enlightenment and the love of the Creatorthe Dreamer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
