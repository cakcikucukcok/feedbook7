  <title>Conversations with Cilla Black - Ronald Ritter &amp; Sussan Evermore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br /&gt;
Cilla Black passed away on the 1st August 2015. She was England&amp;#39;s favorite show business personality for over fifty years winning the hearts of many generations of fans and to many, she will always be the girl next door.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sussan is a channeler, a gifted psychic medium who can make contact beyond the illusion of the finality of death to the one we know as Cilla.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book is not a biography of her life but a chat about the emotions of her success, religious beliefs, friends and her meteoric rise to stardom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She talks in depth about her friendship to Cliff Richard and his private world, describing him as &amp;#39;a gift of love.&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To understand her friend Cliff, we also made contact with his sister Donna Goulden who passed away in April 2016.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I asked Cilla to tell us about her husband Bobby who died in 1999, she did but also said we could speak to him ourselves, so we did.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will fall in love, all over again with Cilla and her wonderful insights and understanding of Cliff Richard, one of her closest friends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cilla told us that some of our questions had never been asked of her before, so you&amp;#39;re in for a treat." />
