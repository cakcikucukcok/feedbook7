  <title>Connection: Keep Your Light Burning Bright - Katherine F. Bright Nd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Connection: Keep Your Light Burning Bright offers an expert manual on the connection to and interaction with our God and Creator. This guide, written and partially channelled by Katherine F. Bright, ND, includes conversations with Creator; knowledge about frequency and abundance, spiritual advice and life coaching, and healing; and information for use as a personal development tool for those interested in spiritual progression. Also included is an eight-chakra chart with newly channelled information on the chakras that cannot be found elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
This guide is designed to be useful to beginners as well as advanced participants, helping us in the learning journey to discover who we are, why we are on this planet, and where we belong on our souls journey throughout the universe. &lt;/p&gt;
Katherine Bright founded the modality Theta Resonance At All Levels and teaches healing techniques for beginners and advanced enlightenment seekers. She has worked as a radio host and as a professional musician, compiling spiritual and toning instrumentals on her CDs. In this work, she offers her professional knowledge without allowing her guidance to become overly complex. &lt;/p&gt;
Connection: Keep Your Light Burning Bright provides the assistance you need to make your spiritual quest for knowledge and self-development authentic and genuine. &lt;/p&gt;
-----------&lt;/p&gt;
I keep two books next to my bed at all times as a guide for my life and inspiration for my writing. One is Ask and It is Given by Esther and Jerry Hicks, the other is You Can Heal Your Life by Louise Hay but I believe a third very special book needs to be added to that collection. That book is Katherines, Connection - Keep Your Light Burning Bright. &lt;/p&gt;
I have read Katherine Brights insightful, entertaining and practical book and know it is one that would become a well-loved reference book to be used over and over by thousands of people on this planet. &lt;/p&gt;
