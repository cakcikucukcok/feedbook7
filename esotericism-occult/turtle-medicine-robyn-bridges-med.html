  <title>Turtle Medicine - Robyn Bridges, Med</title>
      <meta name="description" content="a lovely book seamlessly weaving two rich themes: The Hawaiian Green Sea Turtle with its Native culture and the authors personal spiritual journey. She artfully weaves both together like a fragrant Hawaiian lei. 
Satya Graha, Compassionate Spiritual Healer, Kaua`i 
I am gazing at Honu, Hawaiian Green Sea Turtles, from a rocky beach at the ancient ceremonial site of Puako, on the Big Island of Hawaii. As these turtles paddle to shore, the incoming tide relentlessly pushes them toward sharp lava rocks, but they simply tilt their impossibly large bodies sideways and allow the power of the incoming tide to maneuver them safely around danger. Entranced by such clever adaptation, I begin to wonder about this as a metaphor for our human condition. If turning sideways could mean changing our consciousness by shifting the weight of our perception, could we, too, allow the energy of incoming tides to work for instead of against us? In doing so, could we live more freely, with greater ease? 
	Turtle Medicine explores meditative attention to animal wisdom through thematic vignettes about Honu, Green Sea Turtles. Meet Oakley, Mea Aloha, to discover how Hawaiians live unconditional love, and Nalukai, One Who Has Endured the Storms of Life, to learn better ways to navigate physical and emotional pain. Sit at the peace table with Kuhina, The Ambassador, and traverse the territory of the aging body with Isabella, 40 Barnacles on Her Shell. Whether your life is currently unfolding beautifully or is full of difficulty, Honu can teach you.
By definition, Robyn is a Kupuna, who is one who stands at the spring or the source. She is a keeper of the light and continues on her spiritual journey. Through her physical presence and her writings, Robyn brings a sense of enlightenment. 
Daniel Kaniela Akaka, Hawaiian Cultural Practitioner 
Eloquent, raw, real, and gentle, all at the same time much like the Sea Turtle.
