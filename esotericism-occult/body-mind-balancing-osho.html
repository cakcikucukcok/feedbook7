  <title>Body Mind Balancing - Osho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Body Mind Balancing: Using Your Mind to Heal Your Body&lt;/i&gt; features meditation methods from one of the twentieth century&#39;s greatest spiritual teachers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many everyday discomforts and tensions arise from the fact that we are alienated from our bodies. With the help of Osho&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Body Mind Balancing&lt;/i&gt;, readers will learn to talk to and reconnect with their bodies. After just a short time, readers will begin to appreciate how much the body has been working for them and supporting them, and from this new perspective one can find new ways to work with the body and create a more harmonious balance of body and mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accompanying the book is a CD featuring the meditative therapy &quot;Reminding Yourself of the Forgotten Language of Talking to Your BodyMind,&quot; spoken by meditation teacher Anando Hefley. Developed by Osho, it guides the listener in reconnecting with his or her body and creating a new and greater sense of well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; of London as one of the &quot;1000 Makers of the 20th Century&quot; and by &lt;i&gt;Sunday Mid-Day &lt;/i&gt;(India) as one of the ten people--along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha--who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
