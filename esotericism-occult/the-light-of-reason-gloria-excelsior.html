  <title>The Light of Reason - Gloria Excelsior</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whenever there is pain and sorrow,  wealth is hidden from reality. 
Whenever there is confusion, disregard, unworthiness, there is a lurking fear that has not been uncovered.
These shadows cover the essence of self.  These shadows withdraw the self to a place of denial where the veil thickens, condenses and becomes a dense cloud full of misrepresentations.
This, dear ones, is the challenge that is to be faced for all who are moved to choice:  Denial or freedom.
Freedom is the strength of self.
Freedom is held with love and light.
Freedom is within the arms of the Lord who carries this burden into the light of reason.
Do you see my dears?  Do you see the love that you have?  Do you see the image of who you are?
You are the image of the Lord Thy God.
You are this light that shines through thy countenance of beauty.
You are all of that and more!
