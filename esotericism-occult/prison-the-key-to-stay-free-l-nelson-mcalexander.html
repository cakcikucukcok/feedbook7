  <title>Prison - the Key to Stay Free - L. Nelson McAlexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Chris was there and witnessed my transformation into a much more dynamic person than I had ever been in my entire life. After experiencing this transformation, seeing me in such a good mood all the time, and noticing how focused I was, Chris asked me if he could read my fathers book. I told him I didnt think hed be very interested in it and that there was more to it than just reading the book. I explained a little bit about it and was greatly surprised that he still wanted to read it.
Truthfully, I didnt take him seriously at all. I figured he would skim through the book and more than likely hed hand it back to me the same day and tell me he was good on that.
After just one month Chris was not Chris anymore, at least not the same person I had come to know for the past four years. He had completely transformed into a very new and improved Chris right before my very eyes; much like I must have done as he watched my transformation. 
He was much more mature, in touch with his spirituality, and most noticeably, he was thinking and acting instead of feeling and reacting. That was about seven months ago and to see Chris get angry now is a very rare occurrence. Now even when something happens that rubs him the wrong way its no big deal because hes able to react calmly and think things through. 
Chris sees the bigger picture now and realizes what is really important isnt behind these prison walls. He now realizes that whats most important is whats happening out there with our families and loved ones in the free world. 
Now we both understand and immensely appreciate the fact that The Key to Stay Free empowers us and gives our lives more meaning than weve ever had before. Now we are confident that we can create a life worth living once we are released from prison. 
Now we without doubt know we will no longer be sacrificial pawns and that we can and will be kings in the game of life." />
