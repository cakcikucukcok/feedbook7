  <title>Encourage Your Soul: It&#39;s Not as Bad as It Seems - Vel Humbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Encourage Your Soul was written to help Christian believers understand that even in their darkest moments, God is always there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes we are so consumed with the everyday trials of life that we neglect to put our focus where it really belongs. We identify with so many issues in our life that as much as we say we have confidence and faith in God, we will waiver when it comes to our own personal issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are times when we look to others to get us through when all we need to do is keep our faith in God, trust in His word, and be confident in who we are in the Lord. He will never leave us or forsake us. I dare you to try Him. After all, youve tried everything elsewhy not try God?&lt;/p&gt;" />
