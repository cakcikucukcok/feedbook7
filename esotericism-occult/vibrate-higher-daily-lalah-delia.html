  <title>Vibrate Higher Daily - Lalah Delia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tap into your inner power with this mind-opening guide to vibrational-based living from Instagram star and self-help pioneer behind the internet community Vibrate Higher Daily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;“There is another way of being in the world. There is a better way to exist, rise, move beyond, and take our power back.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too often we feel pulled down by circumstances or the negativity of others. We think we have no control over the things that are hurting us and holding us back from realizing our truest selves. But according to Lalah Delia, we have more power within us than we know: listen to your unique inner voice and trust your instincts. By doing so, you’re already experiencing the transformative power of vibrational-based living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibrating higher daily is about making intentional day-to-day choices that lift us out of mindsets, habits, and lifestyles that don&#39;t serve us and into ones that do. This book is an invitation to engage with everything that feeds our soul and raises our vibration, and to simultaneously let go of the things bringing our energy down. Through poetry, mantras, and affirmations, Lalah Delia empowers us to live with higher potential and quality of being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vibrate Higher Daily&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is a manifesto unlike any other for stepping into our power.&lt;/p&gt;" />
