  <title>The Holistic Guide to Hypnotherapy - Steve Webster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Holistic Guide to Hypnotherapy
Here is the worlds most comprehensive and detailed revelation of the ancient art of hypnotherapy in two volumes. Whether you are currently learning it, practicing it, a hypnotherapy professional, or just plain interested in the amazing art of hypnotherapy, this book will be your most valuable resource. Hypnotherapy is not the only discipline covered in this huge store of knowledge: among many other things, you will learn about health from a holistic point of view, benefits of nutrition, meditation, about relationships, sexuality and more.
Steve Webster brilliantly explains:
?	Simple, complex and metaphysical hypnotherapy.
?	The differences between hypnosis and hypnotherapy.
?	Approaches and amazing new techniques to use on different personality types.
?	How to use 18 Laws of Suggestibility to rid clients of illness, disease and behavioral disorder, and how to reprogram your mind.
?	Mechanics of hypnosis, the scientific intricacies, and 27 diagnostic tools to help you....
?	How to treat the top 35 afflictions like weight loss, anxiety, pain, sleep disorders, and social phobias.
?	Guided imagery, neuroplasticity, epigenetics, neuro-linguistic programming, ideomotor responses and the power of dream venting.
?	Your clients coping, blocking, release, and defense mechanisms.
?	Body syndromes, how emotions affect us, and the subconscious mind.
?	How one health disorder, HHS, might be responsible for 85% of afflictions.
?	The real Law of Attraction, and how to make it work for you.
Steve has coined a new description for hypnotherapistsConsciousness Engineersbecause thats what they are! The clients consciousness creates their reality, and the hypnotherapist adjusts that consciousness. The subconscious mind vibrates at a level where it does not know illness, disease and behavioral disorder; but the conscious mind vibrates at a lower level and attracts these negative energies. 
After reading the Consciousness Engineering section (Volume 2), you will understand:
?	Your 3 minds, their vibrational levels, and how to increase your power of creation.
?	How to manifest anything, and how to become an ascended master.
?	Learn what the subconscious mind is, and how to guide your client to engage with it, and harness its amazing powers.
The two volumes explain how you create your whole world, and how to create a world that brings you (and your clients!) joy and peace. It explains levels of consciousness, how to increase yours, and how you are immortal in your quantum world.
With over 100 inductions, deepeners and convincers, with over 100 original diagrams and images, and with over 100 informative tables and quotes.
This book really is your hypnotherapy Bible!" />
