  <title>Prosperity Is the Whole Gospel - Blessing Okechukwu Ezema</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The word prosperity has been misunderstood by many to mean only increase in material possessions. However, both the dictionary definition and biblical references to the term are all-encompassing. Scripturally, prosperity means the total well-being of man, which includes his spirit, soul, and body (3 John 2, Isa. 3:10). This perfectly described Abrahams life at his old age, and we are commanded to follow his footsteps (Gen. 24:1, Isa. 51:1, 2). In Joshua 1:7, 8, God commanded Joshua to be strong and very courageous in order to observe and to do the things written in the Scripture, so that he will make his way prosperous and to have good success.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Jesus declares in John 10:10 that His purpose of coming is to give us life and that we may have it more abundantly. Every good sermon, therefore, will usually include all or one of the following:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Prosperity of mans spirit, which enhances his harmonious relationship with God, culminating in eternal prosperity.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Prosperity of the soul of man, which leads to abundance of wisdom in dealing with all issues of life, including generation of wealth.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Prosperity of his body, leading to divine health and vitality.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the above prosperity packages have righteousness as their foundation. The understanding of this truth will help you to be self-motivated towards serving God.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is certainly one of the most important books written on the subject of prosperity for Christians. It is a must-read for all who desire to know the real meaning of prosperity and why God prospers those who serve Him.&lt;p&gt;
