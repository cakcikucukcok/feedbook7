      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Learn from 65 Angels in their words instruction on how to call them closer to you to heal your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Angelic Host Bring Their Individual Services for Humanitys Blessing is an introduction to 65 Angels with instruction about what to request from each Angel and how you can call every one of the Angels to assist you with changing your life. The Angels are waiting for your calls. Instantly, the Angels enfold you with all encompassing love as they joyfully bring Light to bless you. The Angels give their words as an answer to every request. Addressed are topics consisting of: releasing fear, birth and transition, gaining the golden Light of wisdom, life purpose and right employment, seeking the Light and Gods solution for every challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling to the Angels gives them permission within the physical octave to bring assistance to fulfill your call. There is not a problem the Angels cannot solve with your continual belief and acknowledgement of their presence with you. God wants you to call the Angels for their service, blessings and love. You may choose to become an integral part of the Angels service to the Light by speaking their words as decrees to help your loved ones, others in need, the earth and all life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
