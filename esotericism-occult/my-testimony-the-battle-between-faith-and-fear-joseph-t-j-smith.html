  <title>My Testimony: the Battle Between Faith and Fear - Joseph (T.J.) Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Time and time again, we find ourselves in a position where we are forced to do whatever it takes in order to get what we want.  That&#39;s because we always want to try and get the best deal for our money.  For example, when purchasing an automobile, we find ourselves negotiating with the sales person to try and get as much as we can for our old vehicle on the trade-in so that we can get a better deal on the vehicle we want to purchase. What we are really doing is activating our faith because we know we are going to come to an agreement with the sales person if a sale is to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things you learn about wireless or cellular phones is that you can purchase a cellular phone and pay various prices for your phone based on your personal desires needs and wants.  However, if you never get that phone activated, the purpose for which you bought the phone will be meaningless.  The phone must be activated in order for you to get your full utilization of the unit.  In much the same way, my testimonies not only tell about our knowledge of faith, but it shows how we trusted God and activated our faith. &lt;/p&gt;" />
