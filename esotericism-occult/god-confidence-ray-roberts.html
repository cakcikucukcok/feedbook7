  <title>God Confidence - Ray Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The confidence of God is in each of us, but finding that and exercising it on a daily basis can be a challenge. God Confidence explains how to understand the feeling and concept of living a life in harmony with the Divine and actionable steps every person can take to begin living a God Confident life. In simple terms, daily experiences are explained in a way that highlights the spiritual essence of very ordinary moments. Tools, exercises if you will, are provided to help each person use those ordinary moments to build a personal relationship with God.&lt;br /&gt;
God may mean different things to different people, but in the end there is one power and presence in the universe regardless of the name. More importantly, regardless of anyones current belief or lifestyle, that presence is in each of us and direct access to it is our right as spiritual beings. The challenge is to allow and practice noticing the feeling, the joy, and the grander experience of life that comes from accessing our spiritual nature. &lt;br /&gt;
Just as a runner trains to run a marathon, so to must we practice to reach our spiritual potential. God Confidence opens our thoughts and feeling of that potential and outlines the process for reaching the Divine Zone." />
