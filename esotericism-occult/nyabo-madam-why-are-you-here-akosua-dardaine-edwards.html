  <title>Nyabo (Madam) — Why Are You Here? - Akosua Dardaine Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is my story. This is a story of returning to me. This is my story of travelling to Uganda, Africa. This is my story of how I left my island of Trinidad and Tobago to go to Manchester, United Kingdom, to complete a PhD programme and ended up working with women in Uganda and other parts of Eastern Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nyabo (Madam)  Why Are You Here? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To write this, I had to live it. These stories has given me the opportunity to share from the teachers I met throughout my time on the African continent. Sharing these stories has provided me the privilege to learn wisdom, love, life, joy, spirituality, sharing, authenticity and peace. What you learn you teach. I do this with the hope that someone, anyone will take it and make his or her life a celebration of what is possible. To use it as a guide to live his or her life in authenticity, freedom, passion, joy and service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akosua Dardaine Edwards is the founder of the Enabling Enterprise Project. The Enabling Enterprise Project is a progressive and interactive pilot project, which aims to partner Caribbean and international womens business support agencies, policy makers and women entrepreneurs from all over the world for the enhancement, empowerment, exchange of ideas and experience and best practice of womens enterprise and entrepreneurship worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;" />
