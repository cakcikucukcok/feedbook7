Each chapter is a deeply personal, raw and vulnerable account of one or more crisis periods in that woman&amp;rsquo;s life, her Dark Night of the Soul and how, often in partnership with the Divine, she found that deep inner courage and strength to not only break through to a higher level and to grow as a person, but also to follow her dreams and achieve success, often phenomenally.
