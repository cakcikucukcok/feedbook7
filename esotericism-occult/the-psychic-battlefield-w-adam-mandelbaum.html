  <title>The Psychic Battlefield - W. Adam Mandelbaum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A former intelligence professional sheds new light on the obscure  intersection of the military and the paranormal--the Military-Occult  Complex--and reveals the incredible story of psychic abilities turned  into a weapon of war by the world&#39;s soldiers and spies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the  annals of military and espionage history there have been many strange  tales to be told, but none can match the saga of psychic espionage: the  history of the Military-Occult Complex.  With the flavor of fiction, but  the foundation of fact, &lt;i&gt;The Psychic Battlefield&lt;/i&gt; is the complete history of the use of man&#39;s extrasensory powers in search of the information needed to win wars--hot and cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Psychic Battlefield&lt;/i&gt;  spans the five thousand-year history of ESPionage, from the attempted  overthrow of the Pharaoh Rameses by magic to the CIA use of  military-trained psychics during the Cold War.  It is a story as true as  it is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book reveals the story of the sacred  Templar skull; the Angelic communications of John Dee, intelligence  agent of Queen Elizabeth I; the psychic stranglehold of Rasputin on the  Romanovs; and the occult endeavors of the Nazis and the Soviets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Psychic Battlefield&lt;/i&gt;  contains the names and rites of the old demons of war, contacted by  military strategists in search of supernatural support.  It explains and  discusses different methods of divination used by armies throughout  history, and reveals the various ways of making a soldier into a  superman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cast of characters includes such noteworthy names  as sorcerer-poet Aleister Crowley, author Ian Fleming, spoon-bending  General Stubblebine, and Psychic Warrior David Morehouse.  In addition,  the book features an exclusive interview with top psychic spy Joseph  McMoneagle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most remarkable of all is Mandelbaum&#39;s fascinating  exposé of the paranormal research and remote viewing experiments  conducted by the CIA, as well as the real effectiveness of the  government&#39;s Stargate program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney, psychic, former  intelligence professional and dark-side investigative reporter W. Adam  Mandelbaum clearly demonstrates that the final frontier of future wars  and spies is the mind.  Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;" />
