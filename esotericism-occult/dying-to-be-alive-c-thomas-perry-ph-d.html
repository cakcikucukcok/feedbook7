  <title>Dying to Be Alive - C. Thomas Perry  Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dying to be Alive is the first hand account of an incredible experience. In 2008 the author suffered a heart attack and found himself in an ambulance, blacking out and in immediate danger of death. He describes the experience of being in the presence of angels, engaged in conversation with Jesus and then being offered the choice to return to life on Earth or to continue to live in Heaven. The story does not stop there. He traces the intervention of God on his life as he finds love with the woman he was shown while with the angels, and recounts the journey through life that saw him threatened by a spiritualist cult and suffering the death of his brain-injured daughter. This is a story of life and death that goes beyond the realms of a normal life and offers an intriguing glimpse into the timeless realm of eternity. This book offers more than a story. It opens the way to an encounter with Heaven that reaches from beyond this world deep into the heart and soul ." />
