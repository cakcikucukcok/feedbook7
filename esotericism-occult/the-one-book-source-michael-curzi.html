  <title>The One Book - Source, Michael Curzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The One Book is a philosophical treatise pertaining to the nature of all things from the Creator&amp;#39;s perspective. The One Book was channeled from the Akashic Library and is a unique perspective on waking up, awakening, ascension, and Life, A must read for anyone on the path of self Discovery!!! &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The One Book&amp;nbsp;was the answer to my prayers. I prayed to what some call the Universe, Others call the Multiverse, Many Call Yahweh; the Hindi call Krishna, Hermetics call THE ALL, Muslims call Allah, and I prayed for many years for an account of creation from the creator&amp;#39;s point of view. My prayer was answered at the time when I was ready and God channeled this text through me onto paper. It is very short, and yet, increadibly deep with meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each Time I read The One Book, which the Creator gave to the world through my hands, I feel a greater joy than ever before. The Text was a work of the Most High and I cannot take credit for the work. I was on the other hand merely the conduit for this text to manifest. If you have any interest in seeking your inner truth, awakening, or ascending in conciousness I strongly urge you to take the small ammount of time it would take to read this short but concice work gifted to all of us by the Most High. I pray&amp;nbsp;it will bless&amp;nbsp;you as it has me! Enjoy!!!&lt;/p&gt;" />
