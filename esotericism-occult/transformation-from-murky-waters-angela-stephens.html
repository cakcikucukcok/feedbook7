  <title>Transformation from Murky Waters - Angela Stephens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Im writing to share how Ive learned to journey through life, with God, gratitude and peace within my heart.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
I love flowers, the smell, the feel and the beauty they create. They start as a seed and as long as it is properly nurtured, it blooms into the most beautiful sight. When the seasons change some flowers are able to withstand the storms, while others die or become dormant until a new season comes. I choose to use the lotus flower as the art piece for this book. The reason for this is how a lotus is created. It emerges from the depths of the muddy swamp and blooms the most beautiful flower that opens when the sun rises and at nightfall it closes and goes beneath the water until dawn. The process reminds me of how we were created and ever changing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to research it takes 60 days to change a habit; within 30 days you will notice the change, and 60 days for others to notice. My desire is for this book to brighten the light that is already within you and you blossom to greatness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
