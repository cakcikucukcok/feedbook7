  <title>Calling All Youth - Phoenix De Vries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Todays society depends on technology. Whether its for work productivity or simply for entertainment, young people especially are drawn to their devices. They feel the need to have several and, of course, the latest versions. And while it can be beneficial, technology has allowed individuals to live with limited contact with others.
As technology continues to isolate people from one another, its absolutely time for any book that seeks to enhance connection, awareness, and humanity. Author Phoenix De Vriess book, Calling All Youth, presents an intriguing array of choices, meditations, and ideas, each of which provokes serious thought in the individual. It is through such productive and personal epiphanies that true and lasting change can be inspired.
Calling All Youth is not an argument against the use of technologyquite the contrary. It has a role in life. But we must not sacrifice relationships with others. Calling All Youth offers a powerful message of hope through conscious reconnection to self and others." />
