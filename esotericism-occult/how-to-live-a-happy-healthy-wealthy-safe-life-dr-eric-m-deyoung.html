  <title>How to Live a Happy, Healthy, Wealthy &amp; Safe Life! - Dr. Eric M. DeYoung</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Almost half of all Americans suffer from a chronic medical condition. The most common conditions are high blood pressure, arthritis, respiratory diseases, depression, pain, diabetes, and high cholesterol. 
Its time to be more involved in your health care and start asking why? For instance:
	Why do Americans have so many health problems when they consume so many drugs?
	Why are Americans so sick when they can improve their health without doctors, hospitals, and drug therapies?
	Why is the United States making successful strides in disease treatment but not prevention?
These are complicated questions, but its possible that the very drugs Americans consume are contributing to chronic health issues, along with unhealthy choices such as smoking, consuming alcohol, and eating processed and fast foods.
By understanding the business of medicine as well as the factors that put you at risk, you can take concrete steps to improve your health or prevent it from deteriorating. Ask the right questions and start learning &lt;i&gt;How to Live a Happy, Healthy, Wealthy, and Safe Life.&lt;/i&gt;" />
