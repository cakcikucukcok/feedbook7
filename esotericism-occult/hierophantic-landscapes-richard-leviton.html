  <title>Hierophantic Landscapes - Richard Leviton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Earth is poised to make a great disclosure. Its a hierophant.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
But whats a hierophant? A person who reveals the holy light. But it can also be a landscape or a planet. And whats the holy light? It is the structure of reality and consciousness, a map of the heavenly realms, the engineering blueprint of Creation.&lt;/p&gt; 
Some people call this imminent disclosure the Apocalypse and run for cover. But that is mistaken. Apocalypse means the revelation of the divine revelation. It means the end of our &lt;i&gt;picture&lt;/i&gt; of the world as we know it. The world itself will be fine, even better than fine. Splendid. Illumined. The Architect of reality lays down His cards, face up, and you see the whole deck. Here is the truth of yourself and the Earth.&lt;/p&gt; 
How will this disclosure work? What we call sacred sites and holy landscapes will start revealing themselves &lt;i&gt;in full&lt;/i&gt; to us in all their geomantic and visionary richness. Thats the inner patterning of their design, their arrays of Light temples and subtle palaces primed for our visionary adventures and edification. The Earth needs us to have these adventures and visions because thats how we keep the planet healthy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;i&gt;Hierophantic Landscapes&lt;/i&gt; visits five landscapes from Norway and England to California and Mexico, providing firsthand reports on the visions and adventures of a small band of geomancers as they seek to unravel the mysteries of the Earth. Maybe not such a small band, because along the way we encounter angels, landscape devas, Nature Spirits, and otherworldly mentors, and revel in vistas of the ancient past of the Earth when that revelation was as fresh as a sunrise, as it will soon be again." />
