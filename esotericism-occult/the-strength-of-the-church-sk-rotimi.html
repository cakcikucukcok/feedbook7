  <title>The Strength of the Church - Sk Rotimi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Christian faith as it were, has its codes of practice which must be adhered to in order to be pleasing to God. One of such codes is righteousness which the author explained explicitly in this book. Im in total agreement with his submission that righteousness is the strength of the church because it is the very thing that Jesus asked us to seek first in Matt. 6:33. To anyone seeking to deepen their relationship with God and also desiring not to be ashamed on the great day of the Lord, this book will be an invaluable resource. 
Pastor Kola Bamigbade, Regional Pastor 
RCCG, Scotland UK 
Undoubtedly, this book is meant to bring to the fore the ills and weaknesses of the modern church with a view to challenging every professing Christian to self-examination. It is a revelation of the wide gap between the existential world system and the prescribed scriptural standards. It is a tool for raising and nurturing all heaven bound believers in godliness. It will serve as a means of strengthening the resolve of the committed and consistent believer in the pursuit of the things of God. It will serve as a ready manual for awakening the modern church to its responsibilities and the promotion of Christian ethics.
