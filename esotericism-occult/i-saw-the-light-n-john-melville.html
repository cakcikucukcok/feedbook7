  <title>I Saw The Light - N. John Melville</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The life of a hardened soldier and prosecutor for South Africa&amp;#39;s Apartheid government was transformed when he accepted God&amp;#39;s calling and became a peacemaker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can God really protect you in these troubled times; provide for you in a weak economy and does he have a destiny and purpose for your life? The answer is an emphatic yes. The author testifies how, after he &amp;quot;saw the light&amp;quot; and experienced God&amp;#39;s immense power, not a hair was harmed on his head (Luke 21:18), in spite of a price having been placed on it by an Apartheid police death squad. This book tells of how the life of a hardened soldier and prosecutor for South Africa&amp;#39;s Apartheid government was transformed when he accepted God&amp;#39;s calling on his life. After his Damascene experience, he became a peacemaker, making an important contribution to the miraculous transformation that took place in South Africa. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired in his youth to join an airborne unit by the lyrics of the Ballad of the Green Beret, the author narrowly missed death on several occasions. He narrates how God sustained him and guided his every step through harrowing times. This moving testimony is a &amp;quot;must read&amp;quot; for those wavering in their faith and anyone serving in the armed forces or in law enforcement, as well as their families." />
