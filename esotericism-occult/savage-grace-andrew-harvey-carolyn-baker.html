  <title>Savage Grace - Andrew Harvey, Carolyn Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the boldest and most daring book either author has ever written, Andrew Harvey and Carolyn Baker confront us with the life and death reality of the global crisis and the fact that four crucial strategies must be employed not only to survive the dark night, but to inhabit our bodies and our lives with passionate authenticity, honesty, vigilance, community, compassion, and service. These strategies are Reconnection, Resistance, Resilience, and Regeneration. Deep and unprecedented reconnection with self, others, and Earth must be our mission, regardless of the outcome. Distinguishing between problems which have solutions and predicaments which can only be responded to, Harvey and Baker articulate precisely how we have arrived at this unprecedented juncture and offer strategies of resistance against the fundamental enemies of humanity and the Earth. Such a response demands of us something far deeper than what conventional religions and visions of activism call for--nothing less than living and acting from the Sacred Self, both without illusion and totally committed to compassion and justice even, if necessary, in hopeless situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Trump, its as if the Titanic has hit the iceberg. We are the passengers. The only question before us, and before the whole world, is how we stop the ripping of our hull. The original Titanic sunk due to human arrogance. There is still time for us to save ourselves with the power of humility, resistance and renewal. This book offers a compelling and profound pathway for human survival after hitting the iceberg.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Garrison, Founder and President of Ubiquity University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A powerful manual for a spiritual revolution! Read it, pray it, reflect on it, and then start acting on it...because the future of the world depends on it.&lt;/br&gt;
