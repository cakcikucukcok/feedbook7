  <title>Get to Good - Jacqueline Cornaby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Magnify your potential; not your problems. - Jacqueline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All DESIRES you seek come from abundance, also known as alignment. How can you access your potential and create The Good Life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GET TO GOOD&lt;/em&gt; shows you how to access personal alignment using profound lifestyle conditioning for accelerated abundance. With this book as your guide, you will be able to get out of your own way, get off it and Get to Good. Once you know how to access your personal alignment, you will begin to experience more of the good life, as defined by you. Jacqueline invites you to Get to Good, allowing your potential to come out and play today. Why not take the shortcut to abundance and feel good now? What are you waiting for? Permission granted!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you ever wonder why some days are better than others? Think having the good life is really coincidence, luck and favoritism? As the fortuneteller of your life, you get whatever you think about whether you want it or not. A belief or mantra is a conditioned thought; what have you been thinking lately? Does it serve you? If you continue to tell the story of &lt;em&gt;what is&lt;/em&gt; then you cannot give your attention to &lt;em&gt;what you want.&lt;/em&gt; Your current state of affairs does not have to be your consistent reality. Reality is nothing more than what is currently occupying your mind and captivating your attention. When you give attention to your desires and feel good now before the evidence of your desires show up, you end up taking the shortcut to the good life. The only reason you do not choose to &lt;em&gt;Get to Good&lt;/em&gt; now is because you give more attention to your sophisticated excuses than your potential. With a little bit of practice and insight, you will find yourself choosing alignment for the pure sake of alignment. The intention behind &lt;em&gt;Get to Good&lt;/em&gt; is personal alignment for accelerated abundance in every area of your life. Take a moment to imagine the possibilities of you being aligned in your spirit, health, finances, relationships, career and purpose in life. You are going to read it, hear it, say, think and see it abundantly so it becomes a mantra for life: &lt;em&gt;Get to Good! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
