  <title>Journey of the Heart - Catherine Ghosh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book has woven together the voices of over seventy women of diverse ethnicities and traditions. In meditative and insightful poems, they offer us revealing glimpses of their souls engaged in meaningful dialogue with the world, others, themselves, and divinity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spiritual poetry draws from the timeless wisdom, power, and beauty residing deeply within the hearts of all women. Emerging within archetypal themes that deliver valuable messages, the inspiring and uninhibited chorus of voices beckons us to journey along with them into the wild, mysterious, and uncharted territory of a womans heart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this beautiful volume of poetry, Catherine Ghosh gives us the voices of womens spiritual expressions across cultures. The many women who contribute their hopes, fears, visions, and life narratives to this volume fulfill the poet Muriel Rukeysers injunction: Breathe in experience, breathe out poetry. Every woman (and man) will find poetry that speaks to the heart and the soul. I highly recommend this volume to anyone who values the poetry of womens lives and imaginations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Roberta Rosenberg, Professor of English and Co-Director of Womens&lt;br /&gt;
and Gender Studies, Christopher Newport University, Virginia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This beautiful book of verses speaks of the longings of the heart, the habits of the mind, the prayers often unspoken; of silent cries in the dark to God, to the universe, to life itselfto anyone who may listen and be moved. It is an ode to the muzzled yearnings of half of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
