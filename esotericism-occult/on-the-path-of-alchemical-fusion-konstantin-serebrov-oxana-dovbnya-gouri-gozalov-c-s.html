  <title>On the Path of alchemical Fusion - Konstantin Serebrov, Oxana Dovbnya, Gouri Gozalov c.s.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An autobiography. The novel &amp;lsquo;On the Path of alchemical Fusion&amp;rsquo; is the final book of the trilogy &amp;lsquo;Lessons of Master G&amp;rsquo;. It relates the further acquaintance of Kasyan and Gouri with G&amp;rsquo;s former followers. The intrigues of an &amp;lsquo;alchemical court&amp;rsquo; that G, as a part of his mission, created in Moscow, strongly amplifies the contradictions and conflicts between Kasyan and Gouri. G teaches Kasyan and Gouri how to keep inner contact with the Ray of the School, and with each other.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
After passing through the &amp;lsquo;alchemical fire&amp;rsquo; Kasyan and Gouri receive their first alchemical initiation. This initiation opens the mysteries of the alchemical stage of Nigredo for them. The astralized space of this stage is described in the supplement Adventures of Master G and his faithful disciples Morose and Bitumen in the Nigredo Valley, or Modern Alchemy, which will be published soon.&lt;br /&gt;
In order to follow the alchemical Path of Master G further, the light Path of ascension, they have to undergo the next alchemical stage, which is the stage of purification called Albedo. This stage and its various techniques for the purification of the soul and the sublimation of perception are described in the books of the series called &amp;lsquo;Alchemical Teachings&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Inner Light&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Inner Christianity&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
