  <title>Into Minds—An Introduction to Quantum Psyche Process - Maxine Harley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you have ever wondered why you say and do the things you do, even though they prevent you from getting what you actually want? Well, its time you got out of your own way and became acquainted with, and changed, your hidden subconscious belief systemcalled here the Scriptthat has been running, and perhaps ruining, your life so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all desire the same thingsto be loved, heard, and understood; to have a sense of belonging; to find meaning and a sense of purpose and fulfilment in our livesand yet so often we are the very ones denying ourselves these things without even realising how or why were doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your SCRIPT represents your Sub Conscious Rules Influencing Present Time. It was drafted when you were only a small child, yet it directs your adult life over 90 percent of the time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In&lt;i&gt; Into Minds,&lt;/i&gt; I introduce a brief yet highly effective therapy called Quantum Psyche Process, which is the new paradigm in therapy and has been carefully developed to ensure that you find and improve what is written in your own Script. This will at last release you from the conditioning of your past and enable you to begin to live a new lifethe one of your own creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can change your life in 24 hours by changing your Script.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
