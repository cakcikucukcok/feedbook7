  <title>The Faceless Goddess - Brenda L. Aranda Martinez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Within everyones personal story is the presence of the Divine making Itself  known. 
In The Faceless Goddess: Dreams, Fantasies, and Visions of a Feminine Nature, the author tells the story of her own life experiences, which is really a personal journey in search for the Divine in her own life. As a child and an adolescent, the author is not aware that the journey is taking place. As an adult though, she begins to realize that something extraordinary is taking place when she begins to ask questions such as Who am I? and What purpose and meaning does life hold for me? Over time, and with much introspection through dreams, fantasies, and visions, as well as with her work with the archetypes, the author begins to realize that her search for the Divine is really a search for her True Self. She also discovers that by finding her True Self, she will also find the purpose and meaning to the life she is living. 
Eventually, she comes to the conclusion that life itself is an expression of the Divine in the living world. And that humans experiences are a living testimony that the Sacred and the Divine are ever present in the world around them and within their very being." />
