      <meta name="description" content="Join in the remarkable and inspiring journey of a young woman jumping off the cliff, overcoming her own fears, and leaving behind the country she called home for 25 years to explore new horizons, cultures and people, and delving into a journey of healing and spiritual depth that led her to uncover more and more of her own personal and objective truth by following her hearts desire and her passion for horses. Exploring the way of the horse has helped her to establish boundaries, become a leader in empowering ones self, and assist people in healing themselves through the horse. When her husband passes away, she drew inward to explore the spiritual realms even more deeply than before, being guided on another amazing journey exploring the inner world and other realms, ultimately realizing that there is no death and that death means just a change in form. This inward journey compliments her outer world and reveals her life mission, in which she chooses to give up everything in order to follow her deeper calling." />
