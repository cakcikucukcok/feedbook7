  <title>The Joseph Communications: Illumination - Change Yourself; Change the World - Michael G. Reccia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Time is running out - our Earth is heading for cataclysm. In this vitally important, spiritually empowering new book the highly evolved spirit guide, Joseph, reveals how each of us can literally save the world ...before it&amp;#39;s too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We need to change and accept personal responsibility now - or Joseph warns there are only three generations left. &amp;acirc;??The Field&amp;#39; (or collective consciousness we live in) has become so polluted by mankind&amp;#39;s negative energy and base vibrations over the millennia that the planet cannot sustain itself for much longer ...unless radical changes are made to the way we think.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is our responsibility as co-creators to renew the Field by infusing the collective consciousness with sufficient Light to redress the balance and return the planet to the paradise it originally was. Illumination provides all the &amp;acirc;??tools&amp;#39; to achieve both personal and global enlightenment by giving the reader empowering concepts, uplifting meditations and effective ways of directing Light to transmute our negativity and suffering into harmony, joy, love, peace and spiritual progression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All that is needed to save the planet is for enough of us to reconnect to the Light within and to send it out into this illusion we call &amp;acirc;??reality&amp;#39;, but there is a great urgency to Joseph&amp;#39;s words - we do not have an infinite number of tomorrows in which to put things right. We need to begin now." />
