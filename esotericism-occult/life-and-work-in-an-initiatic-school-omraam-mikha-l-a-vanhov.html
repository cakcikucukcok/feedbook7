  <title>Life and Work in an Initiatic School - Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;?We are here between the four walls of this room at the Bonfin, but we are also in the town of Fréjus. Fréjus is in the Var, the Var is in France, France is in Europe, and Europe is one of the continents on earth. The earth belongs to the family of planets in the solar system, the solar system belongs to a galaxy, and that galaxy is a tiny part of the whole cosmos. Yes, the amazing truth is that we are here in this room and, at the same time, in the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;What conclusion, if any, can we draw from this? The conclusion that, as cosmic beings, we must not eternally confine ourselves to our own petty interests. We must open our eyes and remind ourselves that we have cosmic work to do. What is the use of belonging to the Universal White Brotherhood if we do not work for broader, more far-reaching goals – for the welfare of the whole world? From now on, try to change your usual way of seeing things, and adopt a broader point of view. Try to become more aware of being part of the cosmos, of being linked to the whole universe, and try to see that this means that the things you do, as well as how you do them, must change.?&lt;/div&gt;
