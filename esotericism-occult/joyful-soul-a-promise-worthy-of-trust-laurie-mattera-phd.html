&lt;p&gt;You will learn how to follow your dreams while at the same time living holistically, because we are all more than our accomplishments and successes, and our lives are more than just the work that we do. You will learn to set goals in order to get the greatest satisfaction from every vital area of your life, with an emphasis on a strong spiritual core and psychological well-being. Start living a balanced, joyful life now!&lt;/p&gt;" />
