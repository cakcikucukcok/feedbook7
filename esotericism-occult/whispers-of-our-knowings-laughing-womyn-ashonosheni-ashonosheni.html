  <title>Whispers of Our Knowings - Laughing Womyn Ashonosheni Ashonosheni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The stories in this book are modern myths filled with passionate images that will remind you to love yourself, laugh, and forgive yourself for sometimes forgetting to be the amazing spiritual being that you are. &lt;i&gt;Whispers of Our Knowings&lt;/i&gt; includes adventures of delight in our humanness and wanders through many of the questions and emotional quandaries we encounter during our journey out of forgetfulness and into remembrance of our wholeness. The stories speak to such questions as; what are we doing here? How did we create what were now living? How can we passionately engage in life? Where are we capable of going? &lt;p&gt;
There are stories for rites of passage in human lives, for seasonal passages and in honor of the elements. The mythological characters, circumstances and vivid imagery will fascinate the part of you that loves to be entertained. The profound teachings woven into these stories invite you to stand so completely in wholeness that every breath you take is a conscious, sacred act filled with pure delight. Use these stories freely for enjoyment or as foundations for rituals or healing ceremonies. Theyre meant to be danced into life in ways that are uniquely yours." />
