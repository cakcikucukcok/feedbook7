  <title>Conversations with a Friend - Dalende</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many books have been written on the Universal truths, but the truths presented here are given in a simple form and language to which people can relate and understand and not in the obscure language of the mystics of the past.  Universal truths are not magical, as they are just truths, and truths have always existed and always will.  The Universe is based on eternal laws and these will never change and cannot be changed. 
You are not what you accumulate and think you own in this life.  Those possessions are just the baggage you carry in this life that allows you to travel comfortably from station to station and nothing more.  This baggage will not improve your conditions when you reach your final destination.  The experiences from the lessons learned are the only baggage you can carry with you, nothing more.  
Dalende takes you on a journey of self-discovery through lifes experiences while discussing topics such as:
	Creation and Manifestation
	Money and Debt Mentality
	Meditation on Manifestation
	Energy and Creation/Use of Energy
	What is Reality?
	Feelings and Emotions
	Time and Space
	How Your Thoughts Shape Your Life
	Linear Thought and Communicating with Your Guides
	Coming Earth Changes
	And more" />
