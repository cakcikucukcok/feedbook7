  <title>What If? - Dr. James H. Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mind, Body, and Spirit         mysticism/non-fiction&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;WHAT IF  ?: Changing Your Life to Fit Your Truth&lt;/I&gt; is Book Six of the &lt;i&gt;MY SPIRITUAL AWARENESS SERIES&lt;/i&gt;. The &quot;what if&quot; statements offered in this book are intended to suggest some perspectives on life different from the conventional, and always from a spiritual point of view. The idea is to connect with the spirit of Oneness we are. The key is to understand that we are not ego but rather Spirit individualized. Thus you have the option of living the ego&#39;s form or changing your life to fit your Truth. Once you see the Truth of your Being, obedience replaces the illusion of choice. The Truth is that clear and that profound.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a result of changing perspectives and perceptions, life&#39;s meaning for you could well take on a new glow, and your life&#39;s purpose become clearer. Continue to reflect, continue to shift your Life according to the Truth you hear within. Continue to acknowledge and appreciate all you already are, knowing that what you are coming to see is the real you, instead of who you have allowed yourself to believe you are. Life demands this of us, those of us who hear life&#39;s call. To do less is to dishonor our Truth. Instead, honoring our inner Truth expands the expression of what we really are into the Universe. In a very real sense, it is honoring and benefiting One as all.&lt;/P&gt;" />
