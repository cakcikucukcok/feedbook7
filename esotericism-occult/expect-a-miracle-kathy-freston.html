  <title>Expect a Miracle - Kathy Freston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The miracle of a wonderful partnership awaits each of us. All we have to do is close our eyes and open our minds....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The search for the love of our lives is one we&#39;ve all experienced. Those of us who feel we just can&#39;t find what we&#39;re looking for often get stuck in a rut of negative beliefs, unfulfilled needs, and blame. Instead of looking within ourselves to discover who we truly are and what we desire, we often look to someone else &quot;out there&quot; to make us happy and whole. We bury our true needs, play games, and try to be someone we&#39;re not. The result is that we keep playing out the same unhealthy pattern, attracting more of what we don&#39;t really want, bringing ourselves only more frustration, loneliness, and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meditation counselor Kathy Freston has been through that vicious cycle herself--and finally broke free. In this honest, compassionate, and wise book, she illuminates the path to greater self-awareness--and the real love we all crave. Not a pat book of &quot;dating advice&quot; or a guide to manipulating others, &lt;i&gt;Expect a Miracle&lt;/i&gt; is a wholly new kind of guide to the search for a great relationship, one that puts the focus back where it belongs: on our own personal transformation. Using principles from Eastern philosophy, meditation, A Course in Miracles, twelve-step recovery, and psychotherapy, the book helps us to become magnetic to the perfect relationship that awaits us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With exercises, meditations, inspiring real stories, and the warm candor of a wise friend, &lt;i&gt;Expect a Miracle&lt;/i&gt; is a positive, practical, and powerful book for all of us who are still looking for that one great love--the one that starts with a spiritual journey within.&lt;/p&gt;" />
