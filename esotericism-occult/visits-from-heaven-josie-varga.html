  <title>Visits From Heaven - Josie Varga</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you think you&#39;re going to die, then you&#39;re in for a big surprise. This book will not only challenge your assumptions, it will give you the proof that you never thought existed. Not only are there substantial scientific studies indicating that our consciousness survives death, but those on the &quot;other side&quot; have come back time and time again with evidential messages for their loved ones.  Josie Varga has assembled an incomparable collection of what she terms &quot;visits from heaven&quot; from around the globe and backed up by testimony from some of the world&#39;s leading experts on afterlife communication: This groundbreaking book will lead you to question your own mortality with the realization that we are all eternal energy beings, and energy can neither be created nor destroyed. When you reach the end of this book, you will find that the most prudent explanation is that there is nothing final about death. You always were, and you always will be." />
