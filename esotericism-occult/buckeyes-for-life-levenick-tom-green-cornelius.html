  <title>Buckeyes for Life - Levenick Tom, Green Cornelius</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buckeyes for life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is written in honor of the bond of former Ohio State Football Athletes that is extraordinary and has transcended the generations.&amp;nbsp; It is amazing to witness this &amp;ldquo;Buckeye Brotherhood&amp;rdquo; in action, when you see teammates from every decade going back to the 1940s, staying in touch, connected tightly, often coming to the aid of a teammate in need or giving a &amp;ldquo;pat on the back&amp;rdquo; during a celebratory moment in their lives.&amp;nbsp; I believe this environment was created from Woody Hayes&amp;rsquo; philosophies that &amp;ldquo;You Win with People&amp;rdquo; and you should always &amp;ldquo;Pay Forward.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; Despite numerous referrals by former players to stories and teachings by Woody Hayes, this is not intended to be a total &amp;ldquo;Woody book.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, while this is predominantly about Ohio State Football, there is a prevailing cascade of this culture throughout Ohio State Athletics in general and I have relayed thoughts, stories and experiences from letter winners in men&amp;rsquo;s basketball, track and field, golf, women&amp;rsquo;s basketball, women&amp;rsquo;s swimming and The Ohio State University Marching Band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This culture has also begun to expand to the overall Ohio State University society.&amp;nbsp; Simply go to the Ohio State University Alumni Association internet site, where there is a section under membership, where you can &amp;ldquo;Pay Forward&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s face it.&amp;nbsp; Life is a competition.&amp;nbsp; You compete for positions and promotions at work.&amp;nbsp; You compete for the best parking spot.&amp;nbsp; You compete for the best spot in the checkout lane at the grocery store. You compete for the best table at a restaurant.&amp;nbsp; You compete to have the best-looking lawn in your neighborhood.&amp;nbsp; On and on and on!&amp;nbsp; There are many social elements within this book that facilitate The Ohio State Buckeyes being the best competitors and winners possible.&amp;nbsp; These elements and characteristics, when applied to everyday life, will foster success and wonderful life fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am so proud to be a graduate of The Ohio State University and I am even more gratified and fulfilled to be a member of the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Buckeye Brotherhood&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Buckeye for Life&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent experience with brain surgery and Brain Cancer, which I am still battling today, has precipitated this book.&amp;nbsp; The outpouring of prayers, care and concern from my &amp;ldquo;Buckeye Brothers&amp;rdquo; has been incredible and extremely gratifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My current experience with Brain Cancer also inspired me to donate a percentage of the proceeds from this book to the Urban and Shelley Meyer Cancer Research Fund at the James, Ohio State&amp;rsquo;s Comprehensive Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the &amp;ldquo;Buckeye Brotherhood&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Winning with People&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Paying Forward&amp;rdquo; have transcended the generations at Ohio State and have been passed from Woody to Earle Bruce, John Cooper, Jim Tressel and now Urban Meyer.&amp;nbsp; Coach Meyer embodies those philosophies and has taken them to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;" />
