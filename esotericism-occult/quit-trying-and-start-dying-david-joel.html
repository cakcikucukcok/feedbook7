  <title>Quit Trying and Start Dying! - David Joel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A short time before this work went to press, I was listening to some of my favorite worship music and going over various parts of the completed work. In His still small voice, He told me, David, this is not your book.  I quickly replied, Lord, this has never been mine. You wrote this through me. It belongs to You. He then said, David, this is not your book. It is your testimony. I wept so hard and passionately that I now hope everyone who reads this would have the same opportunity to hear our Father say this to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The months spent listening and writing this were the most painful and profoundly exciting of my entire life. But the results, left up to Him, were being able to see my Savior on the Throne, and myself on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Friends, theres no other way to make it home. . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
God has chosen me to speak the deep things from His heart to those who would listen; those who are hungry and thirsty for His righteousness. In a society like ours, filled with choices, it can be very difficult to adhere to the only choice that keeps us on the narrow road; submission to Christ. There is so much more that the Spirit has given me, shown me, and I will respond to any questions or invitations the Lord sends to me. Feel free to contact me at GodUnlimited@yahoo.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May God bless you all, and all you bless.&lt;/p&gt;" />
