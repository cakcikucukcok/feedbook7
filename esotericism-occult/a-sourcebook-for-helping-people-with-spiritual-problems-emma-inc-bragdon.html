  <title>A Sourcebook for Helping People With Spiritual Problems - Emma Inc. Bragdon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As more people practice meditation, yoga, and participate in workshops for personal transformation, increasing numbers of them are having experiences related to spiritual awakening. The problem is they don&amp;#39;t know the territory. An intense spiritual experience can seem overwhelming and scary and even be confused with going crazy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This practical book is the classic text, newly updated in 2006 (3rd edition), defining the problems that can arise when someone is disoriented by intense spiritual experiences. It is a valuable resource for anyone interested in spiritual experiences and their relationship to mental health and mental illness. It distinguishes the differences between various mental pathologies and indicators of spiritual awakening. It clearly describes the kind of care one needs in a spiritual emergency process and how the care is dramatically different than conventional psychiatric treatment. It traces the history of how signs of spiritual awakening have been perceived in the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Graduate schools of psychology use this book as a text because it is such a clear statement about the nature of spiritual crises and appropriate treatment. However, it is written in a style that is also appropriate for any adult reader. The author, a transpersonal psychologist, has written five other books on spiritual healing and awakening. The title of the first edition of this book was &amp;quot;A Sourcebook for Helping People in Spiritual Emergency&amp;quot; and was published in 1988." />
