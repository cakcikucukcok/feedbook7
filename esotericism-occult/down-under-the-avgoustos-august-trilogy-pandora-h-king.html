  <title>Down Under: the Avgoustos [August] Trilogy - Pandora H. King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The narrative storyline entails an in-depth, and firsthand account of unexplainable events that could relatively be linked to intuitions, and precognition, the ability to predict future events. Over a span of several years, the writer had intermittingly foretold a series of inexplicable events that were depicted through premonitions, and psychic dreams and real-time occurrences. Initially, these encounters were ruled as mere coincidences in a moderately tranquil world that fostered logical reasoning until a remarkable Australian abruptly entered into her seemingly conventional lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The enthralling and often mysterious Australian afforded a riveting adventure whereas the writer was profoundly captivated through his risk-taking antics and daring pursuits. It was easily ascertained how an earlier premonition had ultimately laid the framework for their most extraordinary and unusual encounter.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The couple shared a perpetual bond that was strikingly uncanny but the writer started to experience a sequence of strange premonitions, which exclusively forewarned a chain of events that predicted doom in a relatively promising relationship. When the center of her universe and mate unexpectedly vanished, the writer&#39;s premonitions commenced to unfold. Her practical world as a doctoral student, and researcher evolved from a transfixed state of heightened exhilaration, to bewilderment and subsequently a continuous pattern of sheer mayhem.&lt;/p&gt;" />
