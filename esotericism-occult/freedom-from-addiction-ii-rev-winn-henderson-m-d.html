  <title>Freedom from Addiction Ii - Rev. Winn Henderson M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Freedom from Addiction II could well be the most important book of the twenty-first century. Why is that? With over eight billion people in the world suffering from the disease of addiction in one form or another, the pain and suffering generated by addictive behaviors is staggering!
Freedom from Addiction II improves twenty-one psychological symptoms: anxiety, depression, pain, loneliness, lack of love, a void, emptiness, unworthiness, sense of failure, sorrow, insecurity, guilt and shame, unhappiness, lack of acceptance, lack of energy, fear, boredom, resentment, self-pity, need for immediate gratification and pleasure, and suicidal thoughts.
It cures over twenty-four different addictive behaviors: codependency/control, marijuana, alcohol, hallucinogens, opiates, inhalants, depressants, stimulants, anabolic steroids, gambling, kleptomania, smoking, sociopathic / criminal behavior, overeating or undereating, sexual and nonsexual abuse, workaholism, excitement, power and greed, teenage rebellion, sexual compulsions, overspending, negative thinking, TV / Internet / smartphone overuse, relationship addiction, and collectaholism/hoarding.
In this book, you will learn a proven do-it-at-home treatment program which has been successfully used for over twenty-five years. If you meet three simple criteria, the success rate for curing your disease is 100 percent! If you meet these three simple criteria and your addictive behavior is not cured, we will gladly return your investment. This is a no-risk 100 percent lifetime guarantee." />
