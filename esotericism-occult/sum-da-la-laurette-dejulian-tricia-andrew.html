  <title>Sum Da La - Laurette Dejulian, Tricia Andrew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The offering that We bring are the messages. The Communication that We bring does not shelter you from your experiences, but offers understanding. Once you realize that all is well, you invite that information freely. Here is what We have to say: we offer you the information so that you can give your offering to one another. Each of you has come into existence with an offering. We say offering, not sacrifice. For a sacrifice implies that you have to do without or that you give away something of your own. We say offering because you give away what is yours, and when you give you also receive. Your offering is your gift of light. How do you shine forth for your neighbor? You can almost think of your offering as forming a chain. You give and then connect to the one to whom you give, and they connect on to another. This concept is one that should be called to mind when you feel that perpetuation of a routine existence. To live as you truly wish, you must share the offering. 
Love, Michael" />
