  <title>Hidden Scars - Tessa Rey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Growing up in a small town and barely surviving abuse and teenage drinking,
Tessa takes off for the US Air Force to change her life, but poor choices continue
to haunt her with betrayals as she searches for that ever-elusive desire to be
loved.
She starts a family; however, just when life seems to straighten out, drug abuse
enters her home, and then physical illnesses start plaguing her. So begins a life of
struggling to survive so she can raise her children.
Given less than a year to live after a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer, she
turns to the Lord. She is not prepared for the feelings of love and belonging she
has missed all her life.
After another divorce, she takes her children and moves back close to her
hometown so that she can live in peace and raise her children. Tessa struggles
with her relationship with her parents, and then after her younger sister commits
suicide, her mothers words change her life forever. Tessa starts dealing with the
scars she has kept hidden all these years. Hidden Scars is that journey of learning
to live with those scars like tattoos on the soul so that she can be set free." />
