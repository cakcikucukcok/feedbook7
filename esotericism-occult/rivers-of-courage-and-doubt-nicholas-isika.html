  <title>Rivers of Courage and Doubt - Nicholas Isika</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an incredible, inspiring true story of a young mans dream and stubborn courage.
Nicholas Isika left Kenya as a teenager and arrived in the United States with only forty-five dollars in his pocket, but he earned an education at Augustana Academy in Canton, South Dakota. Even then, it was never a given that he would build a career in finance and a successful international business.
Much of his success can be traced back to the wisdom instilled in him by his parents, who always told him, The mind that wont quit through hard times and refuses to sit and wait, but applies action instead, is the mind that will succeed.
Youll be inspired by Nicks journey from farming in Kenya to playing an important role in high-stakes business in his adopted country. His perseverance, family values, and intelligence allowed him to learn tremendous lessons while traveling down Rivers of Courage and Doubt." />
