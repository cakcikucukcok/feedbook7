  <title>The Trust Frequency - Andrew Cameron Bailey, Baxter Marlow Connie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;THE TRUST FREQUENCY: Ten Assumptions For A New Paradigm&amp;quot; is a visionary, uplifting synthesis of quantum science, Eastern mysticism, indigenous wisdom and plain common sense. This practical self-help, personal-development handbook guides us through the next phase of our personal evolution and sets us firmly on the high road to happiness. Accessing &amp;quot;The Trust Frequency&amp;quot; triggers a very powerful upgrade to our individual and collective operating system. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Humanity stands at the brink of an unprecedented change, a &amp;ldquo;great awakening,&amp;rdquo; the Omega Point, the evolutionary quantum leap predicted by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin in &amp;quot;The Future of Man&amp;quot; (1950). All around us we see signs of gathering crisis, economic collapse and climate change. Contrary to popular sentiment, this is a good thing! The old systems based on fear and doubt are collapsing, as indeed they must. Only through crisis do we grow. Imagine what the caterpillar goes through on its way to becoming the butterfly. As we awaken, we realize we need a new reality, a new paradigm, but how do we go about creating one?? &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
We have been engaged in the endless &amp;ldquo;pursuit of happiness,&amp;rdquo; but happiness has eluded us. Why? Because for thousands of years we have based our consensus reality on a set of limited, erroneous, fear-based assumptions about ourselves, our species and about the entire universe. We can change that! The choice to move into the Trust Frequency triggers a shift to an elevated state of Being, individually and collectively. Once we learn to access this state of peace, love, beauty and abundance, we find ourselves operating at a completely different vibratory rate, where the laws and rules are different. Wisdom, prosperity and enlightenment are the order of the day. We are happy. How do we get there? We elevate our consciousness. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
How do we do that? We change our minds, or rather, the content of our minds. We examine and update our fundamental assumptions about the nature of reality, act according to our inner knowing, and our outer world changes accordingly. It&amp;rsquo;s an infinitely more beautiful Universe than we ever suspected. This book takes us there, right to the heart of it. Since we can choose our own reality, let us create a life of grace and ease, abundance, beauty and balance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Why is this book important to you, the reader? Because it is a direct path to a higher consciousness. From a higher consciousness we experience a much more beautiful world. The Ten Assumptions will change your life, and the lives of those around you. &amp;quot;The Trust Frequency&amp;quot; is essential reading for anyone who is longing for an upward quantum shift in their own reality and in that of society at large. The First Assumption is this: We live in a conscious, loving Universe. There is only Love. That changes everything, does it not? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wonderfully lucid guide to living more fully and deeply on this Sacred Earth by two loving and highly evolved conscious guides.&amp;quot; Hazel Henderson, PhD. Author, Futurist&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What impresses me most about the &amp;lsquo;The Trust Frequency&amp;rsquo; is that it is written from a higher dimensional awareness and clarity that energetically transfers to the reader.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Deborah Rozman, PhD. CEO, Institute of HeartMath&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;...welcome yourself into a poetic, philosophical, scientific, artful, and ultimately very personal exploration into who you are, what is real, and how you can participate in the next phase of our evolution.&amp;quot; Cassandra Vieten, PhD. Director of Research, Institute of Noetic Sciences&lt;/p&gt;" />
