  <title>The Books of &quot;Is&quot; - Dr. R. Lowery-Hawk D.D.  D.R.S.  PhD.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The first Books of &quot;IS&quot;, is full of contemplative designs and graftics, along with rhythmic writings. All are created to move gently, your sences, and your brain, to &quot;stiring&quot; you &quot;awake&quot;, and into thinking, sensing and obseving the life within you and around you. The writings and graphics are meant to be contemplated upon, and carried  into your daily life, so to awaken you to the truth of you and the universe of life here, now, and beyond &quot;here&quot; and the &quot;now&quot;. I have also included pages at the end of each chapter for the reader&#39;s own inspired writings brought on by the repeated readings, and contemplations of the writings and graphics in this book, so to assist in the activation of your creative and  intellectual mind: right and left brain functions. 
 The Books of &quot;IS&quot; came about after my being mysteriously, intuitively guided, for over twenty-eight years, to write down messages of a higher conscious level, on truths of life, myself, and all life in general. The writings in BOOK ONE: The Dance of Becoming, are compiled writings from a higher presence of love that I was receiving, during a strong inter-sensing, to write down what was &quot;calling&quot; to me. This first began occuring during my pre-teens; then again as an adult, during times of great sorrow or/and lonliness. As an adult, and after writing for almost a year, the writings began taking on a  deeper nature. They began to change into messages and memories of truth, guidance, and gentle love; coming forth, giving me more of the peace and joy they had been creating within me. The desire to write more &quot;called&quot; often and strongly, yet pleasantly to me; and the experience of it all was: ecstasy!  I began to realize that I must have been touching down into deeper parts of myself, and then rising up to the higher parts of me: my Higher Soul! I was then feeling such peace, joy and knowing, that I no longer felt sadness nor lonliness; Instead I felt the great desire and joy to experience and to know more! It felt as if at these times I was my TRUE SELF! I felt complete and all knowing! I felt like I was with the Holies of Holies and the Angels! Then, in the year 1984, I was tellepathicly told by these Sacred Messengers of a higher power/Creator, to put all these writngs into books, and when the time came, publish them to aid all mankind, all existence. 
  From these writings, I  receive messages and teachings that went beyond mundane and into the higher planes of existence, connecting me with the Creator of all principles, of all life: There I connected with Holy Messengers of various kinds. I had asked for valadation on all this and soon found myself miraciously being lead to the meeting of those who were Guardians of these ancient, long protected Sacred Truths; along with findings in old books; and other similar occurences and people. These valadations ranged from old mystery schools, of various kinds, to ancient indigenous beliefs on creation, and a higher powerful being; to more modern religions and scientific findings. I also was lead in syn with others, who too, were  receiving similar writings with same truths; some written a bit differently. In 1884, I was given the spiritual, tellepathic message, that in the future, I would be compiling these and other writings into books to be published for the world. This was so that many people could be reached more quickly, for the &quot;quickening&quot; had begun.They told me that the writings in this book and in others, were &quot;seed-truths&quot;, selectively and rhythmicly placed; camouflaged, seeming at first, to those &quot;not ready&quot;, as stories of meer fantasy, so called: &quot;make-believe&quot; and sci-fy. I was told the writings are done this way so to gently but powerfully, unlock the encoded truths within those who hear or read them and view the graphics.These writings therefore, are like camouflaged words/codes, &quot;hidden&quot; to many, but obvious to those who were ready :&quot;remembering&quot;, &quot;awakening&quot;; therefore, protected from those who would abuse them and interput them with mis-understanding,  in a negative way; thereby,  creating too much chaos." />
