  <title>Mother to Son - Kimberley R. Crouch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Mothers raise their daughters and love their sons,&quot; is an old adage that has been around in the African-American community for years. With the release of movies like &lt;I&gt;Boyz In The Hood&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Menace to Society&lt;/I&gt;, this adage has grown in popularity in the African-American community and has often been used to explain the ills facing many young African-American men. For any African-American mother who has heard this adage and believed it true, comes a compelling book of wisdom, inspiration and hope that&#39;s bound to prove differently. &lt;I&gt;Mother to Son&lt;/I&gt; is a powerfully written book that shows that mothers do more than love their sons. The author, through a beautifully scripted, heartfelt collection of letters, offers candid advice for her sons on the issues they may face from racism to self-recognition. Although written from a mother to her sons, this book provides timeless wisdom for all. A MUST read for any mother facing the challenge of preparing her sons for, and protecting them from, the society in which they must live." />
