  <title>Re-Entering Eden - Carolyn M. Greenleaf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A reunion with ones true self requires the embodiment of the Soul where conscious wisdom empowers the self and influences choice once again. This book begins in the paradise where humanitys roots formed to reveal unknown secrets that led to their fall from grace, and clues that guide them back to their original truths. This opens the gate to reclaim their innocence and divine power. 
Re-Entering Eden is a tool for self-discovery and healing, in addition to providing spiritual seekers with new information regarding Liliths relationship with Adam and humanity. Revealed knowledge is included that demonstrates how the separation of Lilith and Adam established the experience of duality, and the energetic pattern within the word Eden that foretells the path humanity would take to reclaim their truth and freedom.
The information and exercise within this book enable you to heal all aspects of self, including:
Reunite with your inner child who holds the keys to your Divine Innocence
Heal the divisions of the masculine and feminine aspects within self
Reconnect with your Soul to access your Divine Wisdom and Truth
Learn how to use the power of your Soul to heal and create an abundant life" />
