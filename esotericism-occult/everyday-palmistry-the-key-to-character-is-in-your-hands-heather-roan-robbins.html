  <title>Everyday Palmistry: The key to character is in your hands - Heather  Roan Robbins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Heather Roan Robbins brings you an accessible and practical system of palmistry that is easy to integrate into your daily life and deepens your understanding of yourself and the people you meet. Distilled from decades of experience, palmist and astrologer Heather Roan Robbins has developed a uniquely grounded but soul-centred approach to palmistry. She teaches you how to explore the landscape of the hand and come to know the hills and valleys of the hand&#39;s contours, recognize the deep rivers of the major lines and listen to the bend of the fingers. When you understand the shape and form of a person&#39;s hand, you can understand their disposition. Get a glimpse of their lines and get a clue as to how they communicate. Understanding the hand&#39;s topography will help you accept and deal with yourself, clients, family and co-workers alike. For those who want to become a professional palmist, Everyday Palmistry lays a good foundation in an accessible and memorable format. And for those of us who just want to know more about ourselves, this approach to palmistry offers a visual portrait of the patterns of our soul and can give us clues to how to bring ourselves and our lives into a better balance. Because the landscape of the hand changes over time, it reflects shifts in our life habits and the consequences of our major decisions. The hand is your energy conduit to the world. So let&#39;s paint a beautiful future with the power of our choices now." />
