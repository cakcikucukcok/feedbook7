  <title>Seeds for Life: The Lifeseeds Core Curriculum for Living in Full Expression - Dawn Richerson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We are born into this world as powerful creators, agents of change fully designed and equipped to share fine gifts of original design. We have all we need to come fully to our lives and live in full expression; yet, we have forgotten that we are, as we are now, whole and complete. We have lost something vital. The full reclamation and radiant realization of who we are is our first and foremost responsibility, individually and collectively.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Life is a journey of discovering who it is we really are and who we have come to be. Life invites us to awaken the world within for a new beginning, find our forward flow, and embrace a new vision for the nexus of change. I believe with my whole heart this is a journey that can set us free to be who we came here to be. Come to life and live in full expression with Seeds for Life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
