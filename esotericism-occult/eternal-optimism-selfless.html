Fundamental Eternal Optimism Quotes:
Every human that breathes the breath of life knows and believes in the &quot;Total Body&quot; of &quot;E.O&quot; which is an &quot;individual sum&quot; known as &quot;Hope,&quot; &quot;Love,&quot; and &quot;Happiness.&quot;
Eternal Optimism brings you the Total Body of Hope, Love, and Happiness in a true selfless manner that exponentially benefits others firstly and self ultimately!
 All things we do are and can always be reduced to &quot;Hope&quot; and &quot;Love&quot; as we seek &quot;Happiness!&quot;
&quot;Hope&quot; is the &quot;father&quot; of &quot;Love&quot; which is a &quot;simple complexity&quot; that illustrates the essence of trust in &quot;Hope!&quot;
&quot;Hope&quot; is the cause of &quot;Love&quot; and they cannot &quot;exist&quot; without each other!
&quot;Love&quot; is the best tangible manifestation of &quot;Hope!&quot;
&quot;Hope&quot; and &quot;Love&quot; are a combination that is cyclical in nature and dependent on the other to materialize &quot;Happiness&quot; in your life!
&quot;Hope&#39;s&quot; limit is &quot;Love&quot; which both &quot;limit&quot; you to &quot;Happiness!&quot;
Eternal Optimism is acquired through one&#39;s own &quot;belief&quot; and &quot;trust&quot; in the &quot;Total Body&quot; of &quot;Hope,&quot; &quot;Love,&quot; and &quot;Happiness!&quot;
The three &quot;simple complexities&quot; of basic categories for true &quot;prosperity&quot; is the &quot;Total Body&quot; of &quot;Hope,&quot; &quot;Love,&quot; and &quot;Happiness!&quot;
With &quot;Hope&quot; and &quot;Love&quot; in your life&#39;s daily operations first, you have &quot;limitless&quot; progress!
Return Of Investment (ROI) is &quot;limitless&quot; when your first priority is Hope and Love!" />
