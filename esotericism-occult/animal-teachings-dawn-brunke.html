  <title>Animal Teachings - Dawn Brunke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this insightful book, Dawn Brunke reveals how animals can help us to uncover the wisdom we have forgotten. In Animal Teachings, she groups 60 species by their specific teaching - from how to find balance and be a better communicator to being more intuitive and living a joyous life. For example, Fox, Swan and Zebra are united through the teaching of Integration. All three species can help us learn to welcome diversity, reconcile opposites and maintain individuality. Meanwhile, the teaching of Healing unites Dog, Frog and Gorilla, who teach us love and loyalty, gentleness and how to connect to our deeper self. Every entry explores the presence of that species in the natural world and its traditional teaching as it is known through myth and legend or by indigenous peoples. In addition, each group presents a personalised message for humans today: encouragement, suggestions and guidance to help us become more conscious and whole. By opening to animal wisdom, we begin to find ways to reconnect, to deepen, to communicate, to love and to more joyfully participate in the dance of life. With the help of animals, we begin to remember who we really are." />
