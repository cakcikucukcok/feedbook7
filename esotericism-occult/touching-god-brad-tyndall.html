  <title>Touching God - Brad Tyndall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author takes you on a journey to far-reaching corners of the world, where he drinks tea with loving Sudanese Muslims, prays in ancient Coptic churches, and whirls with Sufi dervishes in the desert. In seeking the mystical in extraordinary places, he discovers that an intimate relationship with God can be found in known religious practices. The key is not the practice itself, but the role of the mind and the heart. With the right intention and contemplative approach, the religious practice unveils an attentive and loving God.
The author draws upon Rumi and Hafez, in Islam, and Saint Teresa of Avila and Thomas Merton, in Christianity, and many others to discuss the fundamental principles for embracing the Divine. By distilling the basic tenets and practices of Islam and Christianity, he finds they both hold similar mystical treasures.
Learn new and ancient methods for meditation, prayer, chanting, prayer beads and pilgrimages. Closely examine the Korans incredible poetry and beauty and gain insight into how it has brought millions to God. Learn about lectio divina, the ancient technique of listening to Gods personal communication with you through the Bible. The author provides step-by-step instructions for you to begin to use these mystical tools. By the end of the book, youll have taken your own journey into the heart of both Islam and Christianity and found Love." />
