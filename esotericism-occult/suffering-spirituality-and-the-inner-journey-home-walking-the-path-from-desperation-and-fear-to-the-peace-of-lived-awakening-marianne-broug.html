  <title>Suffering, Spirituality and the Inner Journey Home: Walking the path from desperation and fear to the peace of lived awakening - Marianne Broug</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;an end to suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With deep authenticity, wisdom, intimacy and courage, author Marianne Broug writes of her intense suffering, its transformation, and ultimately her awakening into Spirit or Consciousness as her true Home and the ultimate healer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is a compelling and inspiring account of an ordinary woman living in ordinary suburbia, and her extraordinary journey to Truth and Oneness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than a chronological autobiography, Marianne invites the reader into topics such as suffering, suicide, soul, therapy and therapists, spiritual teachers, depression, creativity, courage, trauma, questions &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of us on this journey need guidance, inspiration and support, no matter what stage we&amp;rsquo;re at. Rather than a quick-fix or self-help manual, this book is wise, raw and humble medicine from one who has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is rich depth that offers a path beyond the superficiality of the everyday world.&lt;br /&gt; Here is inspiration, insight and reflection that speaks to our deepest doubts.&lt;br /&gt; Here is a deep valuing of the wisdom we all carry within.&lt;br /&gt; Here is prose, poetry, artwork and journaling in which to delight and delve.&lt;br /&gt; Here is salve and succor for the sensitive and beautiful soul.&lt;br /&gt; Here is a celebration of our humanity and our humanness.&lt;br /&gt; And here also, are the gentle cautions to warn of dangers and pitfalls that may lie on the path ahead: in therapy, in spiritual teaching, in psychiatry, in &amp;lsquo;normality&amp;rsquo;, in quick-fixes, in spiritual bypassing, in New Age positivity, in over-conceptualization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In this one-of-a-kind book, Marianne Broug invites us in as intimate witnesses to her journey&lt;br /&gt; Home through many black nights of the soul. Writing in the pure voice of Truth, she vividly portrays the paradox at the heart of the spiritual journey, that being willing to unflinchingly explore the depths of suffering ultimately liberates us from that suffering. For all of us who are in pain, this is a deeply inspiring book, showing us that there is an end to the agony, even when it seems it will go on forever. It helps us have faith that if we stay close to our own inner truth, whatever that may be in the moment, we will move towards freedom. As we absorb her words, we feel ourselves gently opening into a deeper sense of presence, affirming both our own potential for liberation and the unmistakable authenticity of Marianne&amp;rsquo;s account. She goes as a guide before us, illuminating the way through the darkness, encouraging us all to follow her Home.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Persephone Maywald M.A. Psychologist and IFS Therapist&lt;/p&gt;" />
