  <title>Oceans of Wisdom - Linda J T</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Oceans of Wisdom is a collection of stories about wisdom, the oceans wisdom, pleasures of the ocean, life at the beach, ocean facts and creatures, and some of my personal stories about life. Most chapters open with a quote filled with ideas. I have set up this book in small chapters as thoughts to take with you to the beach or to keep on your bedside table, to think about throughout your life. I share the stories so you can be inspired and also to strengthen you, wherever you may be on your journey through-out your life. Maybe this book will nudge you in the direction of something new or just help you to make some sense of the journey you are about to take. I believe that the time you spend, whether reading or being in nature, at the beach, getting a massage, or meditating, is the time for your soul. I hope when you read this book that it speaks to you in a special way, the way the ocean has in my life. I seek to capture the essence of the mind and to share the oceans of wisdom with you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
