      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt stuck in a life that you didn&amp;rsquo;t choose? Then you need to begin &lt;em&gt;designing&lt;/em&gt; your life to effect real, positive change!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change is essential to self-growth, yet even when change is planned, we all go through times when we feel like there&amp;rsquo;s no rhyme or reason for what&amp;rsquo;s happening around us. &lt;em&gt;Life Under Construction: Designing a Life You Love&lt;/em&gt; will help you transform change from a chaotic storm into an adventure&amp;hellip; an adventure that you&amp;rsquo;ll wake up every day feeling excited about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What changes are you facing in your life today? Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re starting a new career. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve become a new parent. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re transitioning into retirement. Or perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve decided that enough is enough and you simply want to become a better version of yourself. Whatever your goal, the key to success is harnessing change by designing your life. &lt;em&gt;Life Under Construction&lt;/em&gt; will help you do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what your own life&amp;rsquo;s construction story is, you will need help and support to navigate through change with purposeful intent. In her first book, Allison Liddle, a John Maxwell Team Certified keynote speaker, executive coach, and leadership trainer, will share with you her own life-under-construction story and offer simple, yet effective, techniques that you can use for designing your own life. She&amp;rsquo;ll help you uncover your true passions, teach you to think big and dream even bigger, share advice from leaders in their fields, and guide you as you transform into a better, more purposeful version of yourself. Your life is &lt;em&gt;yours&lt;/em&gt; to design, why not make it a life you will love?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
