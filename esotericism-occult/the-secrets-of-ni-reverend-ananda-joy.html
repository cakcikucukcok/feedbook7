  <title>The Secrets of Ni - Reverend Ananda Joy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How would your life be if nothing threatened, opposed or had power over you and your highest good? How would you feel if you knew that this moment is absolutely perfect in every way, and you are absolutely perfect in every way? 
You are infinitely expanding ecstatic love, this truth within you cannot be threatened, it is your permant, constant Truth. This book provides a simple and practical path that reveals where you are blocking your inner divine Presence from immersing your present moment awareness. Through correcting and disappearing all the blocks within your own mind, your natural divine radiance and boundless joy will bless and transform every aspect of your life; you will experience a joy and rapture beyond anything your mind can imagine. You become the indescribable peace and bliss that is innately and infinitely within you, your life flows and overflows with miracles and wonder, synchronicity and grace. You live each moment as the ecstatic love and boundless joy that you truly are. You become your unlimited Divine Self, one with all that is and at peace with all beings and all circumstances unconditionally. You live in the constant ecstatic state of rapture and grace. 
I wish that you could know how exquisitely beautiful you are. The vastness, beauty, and magnificence of each human being is profoundly awesome beyond all description. I wish for you to love yourself with a love so complete and perfect. That you choose for yourself a path of love, a path of ease, beauty, and grace because you are worthy of nothing less. It doesnt matter what you have done in your life, you are worthy of the highest joy and fulfillment, far greater than your mind can conceive. Your will and your Creators will for you are the same; a constant state of ecstatic love, rapture, joy, and perfect peace. If you could glimpse for one moment how magnificently beautiful and holy you and your fellow humans are, you would bow down in humility and weep with tears of joy. You are infinite creative energy, beauty, love, and magnificence. You are so boundless that words cannot begin to touch the wonder of who you are. Love and honor yourself as your Creator loves you; a love that is endless, constant, and eternal. The only thing that is certain in this world is that everyone will awaken to an eternal, divine, and constant state of indescribable ecstatic love. Everyone awakens to the infinite grace of who they truly are; everyone returns home." />
