  <title>Mindful Eating - Rachel Bartholomew, Mandy Pearson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do I really need another biscuit/ sweet/ cake/ crisp? Ask yourself the question next time you dive for the biscuit tin. Many of us fall easily into patterns of &quot;mindless&quot; eating. We pick at food while working at our computers, we reach for the quickest - and usually the unhealthiest - snacks for a quick energy boost, we don&#39;t take proper lunch breaks, we are constantly distracted while we eat. We have lost a lot of the enjoyment of eating and as a result we are guilty of just &quot;shoveling&quot; food into our bodies. Mindful eating applies the principles of mindfulness to our everyday eating habits. Becoming mindful of what we are eating allows us to become more aware of the whole experience of eating, and helps us to appreciate and savour our food. By eating mindfully we can also break negative habits such as overeating. It also helps us to avoid the pitfalls of yo-yo dieting, and so enables us to lose weight and keep it off for good. This book shows how we can use mindfulness to aid weight loss by really listening to our body. Filled with practical exercises and delicious recipes, Mindful Eating will set you on the path to a new and healthier way of eating." />
