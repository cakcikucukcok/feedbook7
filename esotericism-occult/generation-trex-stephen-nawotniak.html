  <title>Generation Trex - Stephen Nawotniak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Generation TreX: My Thoughts&lt;/i&gt; is a journal recounting the personal experiences and insights of a young man while he plans a 27-month non-motorized trek of service throughout America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/24/00 - What will become of this quest?  Will anyone care?  I don&#39;t have an answer for these questions and I&#39;m not sure I really want to. To be honest, I&#39;m feeling a little tired of this idealistic crusade. I have no desire to make it a big hoopla event. I&#39;ve been writing that the success of the Trek depends upon my committment to the principles and not the attention it recieves. In reality, however, I have been living the opposite. I have gotten so focused on the image and organization of the Trek that I have stopped simply doing it. This Trek is about exemplifying certain qualities in life, not getting on a TV show. It is about having the courage to display an example for others to follow. I don&#39;t have control of its scale (how many people hear about it), I just have control of its success ( living its principles regardless of the circumstances). If I make it home it will be nothing short of a miracle. I don&#39;t know if I will complete the goal of the 10,350 mile Trek. I do know that I believe in its mission and have to try. I may set out on the Trek, but it is the support team and the people I meet along the way that will bring me home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
