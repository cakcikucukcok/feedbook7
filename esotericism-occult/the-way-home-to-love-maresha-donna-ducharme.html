  <title>The Way Home to Love - Maresha Donna Ducharme</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Way Home to Love interprets the sacred mysteries and esoteric principles of spiritual understanding. It also explores the themes of personal practice in consciousness and how one can find the keys to inner peace.
If Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, Muhammad, and the Divine Mother were to meet in conversation, what would each think of the others spiritual points of views? Maresha has been engaged in a decades long dialogue between the many comparative traditions and distills the essence of unity and understanding held within the heart of all spiritual traditions.
Composed in a state of meditative awareness and clarity, Maresha explores the intersection of what is universally sacred and how to find within oneself this wellspring of love and peace. This book is designed to help the reader to successfully reveal the peace that dwells within ones own heart. This body of teaching transcends religion by extracting the essential spiritual truths that are the foundational guide to the power of personal transformation.
The talks and spiritual teachings in this book were given at gatherings and retreats for spiritual students and seekers at Snow Dragon Sanctuary. Each one is an inspiration, reminding us how to live a conscious life. Each one helps us to remember the true nature of love and the guiding principles of spiritual living: how to be peaceful, beautiful, and more deeply connected to God and how to sustain and nurture our faith." />
