  <title>Diary of a Holy Fool - Vincent Parmentola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rumi wrote: Love came and became like blood in my body.&lt;br&gt;
Love came to Vincent Parmentola and became words on&lt;br&gt;
these pages. Diary of a Holy Fool is a great series of spiritual&lt;br&gt;
journeys filled with Love, Light, Poetry, the deepest Wisdom, &lt;br&gt;
and a map to the best states to live in: Fulfillment and&lt;br&gt;
Nirvana. Read and Reap. &lt;br&gt;
- Michael Modzelewski, author of INSIDE PASSAGES and ANGELES CREST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In&lt;i&gt; Diary of a Holy Fool&lt;/i&gt;, author Vincent Parmentola expresses his spiritual insights in a language rich in prose and poetry designed to capture the profound meaning of his phenomenal adventures while on the path of self-discovery. Inspired by the words of Jalaluddin Rumi, the great Persian poet (12071273), Parmentola traces his journey to find spiritual perfection and closeness to God. The path of enlightenment is a journey of the spirit and of discovering ones true self, the authentic being that abides at the very center of our consciousness and attempts to answer the eternal questions: Who am I? What is the purpose in my being here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a journey of wonder and surprises consisting of peaks, valleys, and the occasional plateau, when nothing seems to be happening, at least to the conscious mind. Parmentola recalls a time when outward success as a fashion designer was a distracting camouflage for the discontent rumblinga rumbling that led to his discovery of Rumi and the beginning of his journey of self-discovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sharing his exciting personal experiences and thoughts in &lt;i&gt;Diary of a Holy Fool&lt;/i&gt;, Parmentola hopes to enliven, motivate, and encourage those with the desire to undertake their own journey of spiritual awakening. &lt;/p&gt;" />
