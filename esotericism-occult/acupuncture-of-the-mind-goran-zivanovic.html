  <title>Acupuncture of The Mind - Goran Zivanovic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the author&amp;#39;s lighting strike and near death experience, Acupuncture of The Mind explores the paranormal, supernatural and psychological disturbances of a psychiatrist, and his patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julian Marcus began his career as a servant of God in a dogmatic religion before turning to psychotherapy for unequivocal answers. But rather than suppressing lifelong psychotic episodes of what he calls &amp;#39;Bleedthrough&amp;#39;, they became even more prevalent and intoxicating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With charming arrogance, he runs a small mental health clinic alongside his fresh colleague, Bliss Stone. Desperate clients are challenged by his techniques, which are never textbook or morally acceptable. Bliss often finds herself wedged between ethics and solutions, whilst Julian swings from one mind-bending revelation to the next meltdown in order to give his customers&amp;nbsp;the full treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to reveal the mysteries of the mind to the outside world, Julian needs to lose his first. Be careful, that&amp;#39;s when his genius pierces through the subconscious and fires nerves. His experiences will become yours, and you&amp;#39;ll be pushed to the limits of mental endurance and reevaluate the meaning of the term, &amp;#39;balance&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
