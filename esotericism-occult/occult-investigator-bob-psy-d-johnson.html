  <title>Occult Investigator - Bob Psy.D. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;Occult Investigator, Real Cases from the Files of X-Investigations,&amp;quot; chronicles author and private detective Bob Johnson&amp;#39;s REAL-WORLD experiences investigating all manner of paranormal and occult events. He is the founder of the world&amp;#39;s only occult and paranormal investigation firm &amp;ndash; X-Investigations, that&amp;#39;s affiliated with a licensed New York City private investigations company. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike the myriad &amp;quot;ghost busting&amp;quot; teams that garner media attention for their &amp;quot;scary photos and creepy sound recordings,&amp;quot; Johnson and  X-Investigations first uses its PI resources to verify if a case warrants any kind of actual occult solutions and if so confronts the events face-to-face using clairvoyant and proven ritualistic methods. Their company credo: &amp;quot;We Face Your Fears.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He&amp;#39;s the Sam Spade of ghosts, witches, demons and things that scare the hell out of you at night who&amp;#39;s studied under preeminent ghost hunter Hans Holzer.  That&amp;#39;s the best way to describe the protagonist and real-life pilgrim of the night as he and his voluptuous Czech sidekick, Silvana recount their adventures into the supernatural around the globe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The author, takes you on a roller coaster ghost busting ride across the country and even into the dark woods of Transylvania (that&amp;#39;s right, in Romania). In eleven riveting chapters, written in a hard-boiled detective staccato style,  the X-Investigations team reveals the details of their most frightening and in some ways totally unexplained occult cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike the myriad &amp;quot;paranormal&amp;quot; investigations and ghost hunting books on the market, Occult Investigator tackles more bizarre challenges including a computer cursed by black magick , a vampire teen who has a blood sucking psychic link with his spitting-image cousin, the werewolf of Van Nuys, California, killer cats, Satanic neighbors in a Manhattan apartment, and our favorite, a sexually crazed succubus housewife who blames demons for her insatiable cravings!" />
