  <title>Queen of Fire - Jennifer Lee Pierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For years Ive been encouraged by many without any connections to each other to tell my story. The time is now right to tell my truth, my perspective, and my experience. Ive been labeled an avid learner, a work in progress, and a truth seeker for myself and about myself. 
As part of my spiritual journey, this book serves as a resource to heal and to be better than my best. In tarot the Major Arcana card Queen of Fire means confident, warm, intelligent, and graceful. She encourages you to stretch your wings and fly, to assert your independence and creativity, and to avoid underestimating yourself. The Queen of Fire is me. It is my hope that this book will inspire you to live without fear, persevere despite what life hands you, and take those moments in your life and turn them into positive learning moments." />
