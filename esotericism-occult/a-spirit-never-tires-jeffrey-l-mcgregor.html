  <title>A Spirit Never Tires - Jeffrey L. McGregor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How can a person have positive, productive days, which sometimes become weeks, and then without warning, experience negative, unproductive days which sometimes become weeks or longer? Is it just the ebb and flow of life, or is it based on our choices and decisions? Life is meant to be lived to its fullest, which is an option for all rational individuals. &lt;i&gt;A Spirit Never Tires&lt;/i&gt; is based on the idea that when you are connected to your spirit, your choices and decisions are flowing and help you manifest the life you desire.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are no born winners and no born losers, only born choosers. Once a person realizes that at every moment in time they have choices to change the direction of their life, then their life will change. Listed below are a few of the topics addressed in &lt;i&gt;A Spirit Never Tires&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Knowing the real you
Choosing the life you want to live
Increasing your belief and confidence 
Goal setting to achieve your dreams
Understanding the impact of your words
Eliminating negative self-talk and thoughts 
Creating a peaceful mind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Spirit Never Tires&lt;/i&gt; is based on the belief that the human spirit never tires of providing multiple options and the best choices to a connected individual. This is your opportunity to jump on the train and awaken your untapped powers so the entire world can see the true and authentic you!&lt;/p&gt;
