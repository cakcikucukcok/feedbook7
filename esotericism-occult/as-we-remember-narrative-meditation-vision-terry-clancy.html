  <title>As We Remember Narrative Meditation &amp; Vision - Terry Clancy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience is saying we are energy, and consciousness is awareness of who we are and what our environment is. Awareness is consciousness that changes as we learn from experience. As we develop, consciousness in turn is changing our experience because the brain is plastic; it changes in response to awareness of self and environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is, if we need to change experience, how do we do that? This book is about meditation as a tool to develop awareness to change experience. That occurs because of synchronicity of consciousness, experience, and plasticity of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditation, as a personal art and neuroplastic exercise, is an internal technology of change. For this to happen, it needs to be understood as a process of the transformation of consciousness, an outcome of self-healing, and a method that connects the two. The method is meditation on goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is occurring through the process is the integration of reasoning with what was unconscious, intuition. We access intuition through mindfulness of goals as inspiration, the energy of intuition that is changing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we self-heal there are different possibilities of meditation. Through self-healing, we achieve health and well-being. Through our empowerment and awareness of this occurring, we prevent mental illness. As we become aware of what has been causing change, vision is remembered. It has been forgotten but, the difference is that we are aware of it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrative meditation is a method of visualization of goals. It is learned in stages on successively building on the method before. The state of meditation is a state of inspiration, of visualization of goals as experience. This makes meditation accessible. What makes it transformative is the healing of the aspects of self. What makes meditation inspirational is that vision is creating our experience.&lt;/p&gt;" />
