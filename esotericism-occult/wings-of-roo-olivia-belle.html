  <title>Wings of Roo - Olivia Belle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When he left, he took a huge piece of me I will never get back. He brought me to my faith and has given me light through this darkness. In this I have realized you left something even bigger here on earth, and it is my job to share it. My sons purpose, his life, his memory, his voice have become my passion. This storm has brought me to my knees. I have looked fear in the eyes, and this monster that took my baby, I have to choose to face it! 
My son left this earth on January 16, 2016, but he is still alive through me. He gave me life, he brought me back to life, and he has shown me what he was brought into this world to do and why God made me his mom. The year 2015 was full of sadness, heartache, and loss. Now 2016 began that way, but I chose to not look at it that way anymore. Micahs death brought me out of the darkness, and he brought me back to life! I have never felt more alive. 
When I am telling his story, I can feel him making my voice louder. I will not stop until every parent knows my story and hears my sons voice. I want people to see how his life, legacy, and memory are shining through me because I chose to fight this fight. 
Every baby deserves to wake up. Every baby deserves to have their story told and their name screamed from the rooftops! I will be their voice. I will be their light. I am coming alive for the babies that cant! 
Micah, your wings were ready, but my heart was not. You are my saving grace." />
