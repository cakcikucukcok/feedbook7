  <title>The Four Gates - Erhard Vogel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Erhard Vogel&lt;/b&gt; has guided people toward realizing their highest potential for more than forty years. Regularly invited to teach among the Himalayan sages, he is recognized around the world as a Master Teacher of Self-realization. This is his third full-length publication.&lt;p&gt;
Do you long to live a meaningful and fulfilling life, beyond the material pursuits of the American dream? Have you worked hard to achieve success, only to find it leaves you feeling empty? Do you have negative behaviors from which you want to free yourself? In this unique work we are privileged to finally have &lt;i&gt;secret&lt;/i&gt; teachings revealed in a way by which they reverberate within, guiding us to live in harmony and achieve fulfillment in Self-realization.&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Vogel tells an evolutionary tale about a wanderer who lives in a world of despair but is inspired by a vision of a life of joy and meaning. He gains the courage to climb out of the pit of despair and travel to that luminous realm. There he meets a guide who helps him unlock four gates. He advances through the realms of Knowledge, the Science of Self, the Meditation of Action, and Love and Devotion, to the Inner Court, the ultimate goal.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Four Gates&lt;/i&gt;, derived from a spontaneous talk given by Dr. Vogel at the Nataraja Yoga Ashram in 1986, includes detailed points of knowledge that guide you on the path to fulfillment by living according to your true identity and thereby freeing yourself from the self-imposed limitations that curtail human lives." />
