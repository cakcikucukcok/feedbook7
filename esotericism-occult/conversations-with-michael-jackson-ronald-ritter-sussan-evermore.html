  <title>Conversations with Michael Jackson - Ronald Ritter &amp; Sussan Evermore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br /&gt;
Michael Jackson is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable and iconic figures of the twentieth century. A musical genius of song, sound and dance with each period of his life identifiable by its own creative ground breaking style. If you were on planet earth from the early sixties to the late nineties you were influenced by the culture that was Michael Jackson, his trademark Moon Walk, white glove and iconic songs made him one of the most recognizable musical personalities. His influence as a cultural icon extended beyond the music and dance, he became part of what we identified as popular culture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then came the public unwrapping of Michael Jackson the person, his obsession with his lost childhood, relationship and marriage to Lisa Marie Presley followed by his second marriage to Debbie Rowe. Accusations of child abuse and court cases came and went, finally reappearing in a damaging documentary &amp;#39;Leaving Neverland&amp;#39;. His children were born and he began a slow retirement into an older Michael. However this was not to be the end of Michael&amp;#39;s career as 2009 brought him a whole new possibility to rectify his financial decline, signing to perform fifty plus tour dates in England and Europe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unexpectedly Michael died on 25th June 2009 aged fifty, three weeks prior to the commencement of his &amp;#39;This Is It&amp;#39; tour in England and Europe. His personal physician Doctor Conrad Murray was unable to resuscitate him, eventually being charged and convicted of involuntary manslaughter, receiving the maximum prison sentence of four years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Michael will undoubtedly be remembered as the greatest entertainer in the history of popular music eclipsing all the legends such as Elvis Presley, The Rolling Stones and those before him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So much has been written about Michael&amp;#39;s life that most of the facts are available to view, what remains are the unanswered questions to his life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Who killed Michael Jackson?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Who are the real mother and father of Michael&amp;#39;s children?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
