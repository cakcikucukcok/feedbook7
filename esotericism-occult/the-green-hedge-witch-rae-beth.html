  <title>The Green Hedge Witch - Rae Beth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rae Beth, author of the bestselling Hedge Witch, here blends the ancient traditions of hedge witchcraft with our modern concerns for the natural world. Working in liminal places and with wild spirits, she shows how we can both help to heal the human relationship with the natural world and cast spells of increase for threatened species.  The Green Hedge Witch is based in the knowledge that we are part of nature, not apart from Her and that this gives us our power and potential as well as our responsibilities. And therefore, by the use of rites, spirit journeys and elven help, we can work heartfelt healing magic. This is a book for the budding spellcaster as well as the experienced hedge witch. This charming book holds something magical for everyone, whether you are a beginner, a practising Hedge Witch or merely interested in the wonders of nature and the hidden secrets that surround us." />
