  <title>A Handbook of Stellar Magick - Cath Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this book is a detailed exposition of arguably the single most significant development in practical magic since the first Elizabethan Age, namely, the synchronous employment of astrological principles in the structuring and timing of magical ceremonies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astrologically timed operations are concerned with the advantages to be gained by ritualising harmonious aspects between the planetary deities. This book reveals how this can be achieved with little more than a Tarot pack and a current Ephemeris. Which aspects to look for, what planets to invoke and how to get the timing right, are clearly explained in the second of three sections, while &amp;nbsp;the first part deals primarily with the philosophical and theoretical foundation of the Stellar Magickian together with the Initiation by the Supreme Ritual of the Sun conjunct Venus (also known as &amp;quot;The Ordeal X&amp;quot;); the third part comprises a set of planetary invocations and blessings. Full descriptions of talisman making, Temple etiquette, planetary feasts, what to do about the Burning Way, and the use of the Part of Fortune, are also given.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The application of astrology to the performance of ritual was pioneered by James Lees and his group in the latter half of the 20th century as part of their wider study of English Qaballa; however, the system of Stellar Magick introduced here for the first time stands apart from all else. This book is meant to be useful to experienced mages and to first-time aspirants alike, and in furtherance of that intention a variety of different personal records from the O.&amp;#39;.A.&amp;#39;.A.&amp;#39;. archive have been included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cath Thompson is an English Qaballist and Stellar Magickian of thirty-seven years experience; in 1980 she was the youngest initiated member of James Lees&amp;rsquo; O.&amp;rsquo;.A.&amp;rsquo;.A.&amp;rsquo;.. Thompson is the archivist of the group&amp;rsquo;s many-layered occult investigations, including their pioneering research and development of the English Qaballa, which Lees discovered in 1976, and the application of astrological principles to ceremonial magick -- groundbreaking work to which she has contributed in no small measure. She lives in Staffordshire with no cats or dogs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
