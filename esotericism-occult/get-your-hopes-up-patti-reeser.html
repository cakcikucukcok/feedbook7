  <title>Get Your Hopes Up!!! - Patti Reeser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What would you do if all of your hopes and dreams were crushed in an instant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Get Your Hopes Up,&lt;/em&gt; the author gives us a vulnerable look into her life while going through what seemed to be some insurmountable difficulties with an unbelievably positive attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the forty-third chapter of Isaiah, he begins talking about &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; we pass through the rivers saying they wont&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;overflow us&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; we go through fire we wont be burnt. But what about when it feels like &lt;em&gt;He&lt;/em&gt;saves us from the fire by dumping us in the river and turns around to do it all again and again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written as if she were talking to you across the table as a friend, with humor she describes her journey with resilience and an incredible faith and vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be encouraged as you read that even in her darkest hour, she still saw God as good and hung on to the promise that &lt;em&gt;He&lt;/em&gt; had a far greater vision for her life than the broken dreams she was now holding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
