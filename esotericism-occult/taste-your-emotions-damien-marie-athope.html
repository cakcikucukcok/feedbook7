  <title>Taste Your Emotions - Damien Marie AtHope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Taste Your Emotions ~unplugged~
This is the second revised and expanded version of the earlier work Taste Your Emotions a book containing poems only each telling a story of the struggle for physical, emotional, and spiritual sobriety. The poems inside this book express a variety of emotions taking you through an experience from deep pain to the joy of emotional freedom. Attempting to balance between a short memoir written in a creative way, self-help book of sorts, as well as grouped enlightened writing trying to lead others in embarking of self freedom. Thus this book is simply not a book of poems and writings it is a dark journey of pain, confusion and addiction leading to a bright awakening of the heart and mind. The poems and writing are both heavy, raw, thought provoking, even forceful in there convictions at times and they are also light and touching in there innocence at other times, culminating in a moving expression of strength and determination. You will not just read these poems and writings you will experience them think about them, be moved by them and maybe if I am lucky even be some what changed by them. 
What was changed from the first edition was some poems of lesser relevance where removed. More back ground to the author his life and experiences behind the poems was added which makes the read much richer and deeply connecting. Likewise there is added writing on the thinking and philosophies which brought about his ever evolving and life enriching change. One mantra he lives by now which he created is: KNOW yourself, LOVE yourself, &amp; BE yourself.
