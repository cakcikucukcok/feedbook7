      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Echoes of a Vision of Paradise Volume 1&lt;/i&gt; presents the idea that a human, Soul-possessing Spirit Beinga gated, unmodulated potential carrier of lightwho is unaware of the Divine Plan is not yet considered enlightened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be enlightened one must be a Soul-possessing Spirit (gated and modulated) Being or an enlightened (aware of the engraved Image and Beauty of God within-Soul-possessing), Spirit (gated, modulated carrier), a Light being!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be an enlightened being, you are aware that you are aware that you are a manifestation of Godable to reflect, as in an image. Second, you have the knowingness that God does what He Wills and as He Pleases. In other words, you are His design and no matter what, all paths lead to God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever one may be doing will eventually lead to the process of enlightenment. The only question remaining is, how do you choose to make your journey? Swift and smooth, or slow and harsh?&lt;/p&gt;
