  <title>The Inner Experience - Thomas Merton, William H. Shannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;  Now in paperback, revised and redesigned: This is Thomas Merton&#39;s last book, in which he draws on both Eastern and Western traditions to explore the hot topic of contemplation/meditation in depth and to show how we can practice true contemplation in everyday life. &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Never before published except as a series of articles (one per chapter) in an academic journal, this book on contemplation was revised by Merton shortly before his untimely death. The material bridges Merton&#39;s early work on Catholic monasticism, mysticism, and contemplation with his later writing on Eastern, especially Buddhist, traditions of meditation and spirituality. This book thus provides a comprehensive understanding of contemplation that draws on the best of Western and Eastern traditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merton was still tinkering with this book when he died; it was the book he struggled with most during his career as a writer. But now the Merton Legacy Trust and experts have determined that the book makes such a valuable contribution as his major comprehensive presentation of contemplation that they have allowed its publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;" />
