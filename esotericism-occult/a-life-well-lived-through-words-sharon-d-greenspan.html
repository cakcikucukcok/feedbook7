  <title>A Life Well Lived Through Words - Sharon D. Greenspan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Celebrating her successes and coping with lifes challenges, &lt;em&gt;A Life Well Lived Through Words &lt;/em&gt;is an account of a womans lifelong struggle with love, relationships, geopolitical issues, lawyering, and disease. Sharon Greenspan has always looked to poetry and writing to find her peace. She writes about her life as an immigration attorney, both in private practice and for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, her relationship with her daughter Samantha, her challenging loves, and her battle with chronic fatigue syndrome. She weaves a story of a life well lived through words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greenspans poems are poignant at times, at other times whimsical, almost fey. She has organized her work well and included both intimate thoughts about her relationships, grander themes such as 9-11, and the foundation of the state of Israel. Taken together, they tell her stories with verve and charm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
