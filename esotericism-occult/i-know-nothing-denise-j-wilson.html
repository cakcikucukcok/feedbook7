  <title>I Know Nothing - Denise J. Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When did spirituality get so serious? As if youve got to take a year off and spend it in the lotus position somewhere in the hills of India. What if discovering the meaning of your life could be done with a beer in one hand and a box of Cheez-Its in the other? &lt;br /&gt;
I Know Nothing is the sequel to Nothing Matters, an offbeat memoir about a woman who, in the space of a few short months, lost her job, her relationship of 15 years and everything else she thought mattered. In a fit of screw-the-Universe retaliation, she moved to Maui where she came to realize all those seemingly disastrous events were actually well-placed stepping stones on a path toward a deeper understanding of the things that truly matter. &lt;br /&gt;
I Know Nothing takes place on Maui, but the everyday situations that provoke new insights could take place anywhere. &lt;br /&gt;
With her deft wording and singular sense of humor, Denise Wilson shares the experiences that have propelled her just a little further down the cosmic highway. &lt;br /&gt;
Are you a spiritual hitchhiker looking for a ride? If you are, grab your backpack and hop in. This book is pulling over for you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
