	The seeds of failure were clearly sown into the life and psyche of the author. Yet the reader will discover that in the midst of seemingly insurmountable odds, David is able to change the odds. This social miracle was accomplished by seeds planted by Davids mother, namely the seed of faith revealed in the telling of biblical stories like David and Goliath (a Divine metaphor if you will).
This book shows educators, faith leaders, policy makers, parents, young people and yes, even the naysayer, how the cycle of poverty, perpetuated by low self-esteem, academic indifference, victim thinking/blaming and dysfunctional family life can be broken once and for all.

Preface
Gods Perfect Timing: Breaking the Cycle of Poverty with Education and Faith is about how important events in our lives happen according to Gods timing, not our own.  Come with me on a spiritual journey through poverty, child abuse, and my struggle to overcome a learning disability through special education.  I share a chilling account of how I survived being struck by lightning at football practice at the beginning of my senior year of high school.  After my dream of becoming a professional athlete got shattered, I survived on the streets with dangerous criminals.
Throughout my life, my mom, Zelna A. Caruth, was my primary source of strength.  She was raised in Chicago and overcame more adversity in her life than anyone I knew.  Her father died in a fire when she was 4 years old and her mother passed away when she was 12. As the oldest of four siblings, with two younger sisters and a baby brother, she called Bugs, her childhood ended at a very early age. 
She was also my most important teacher and source of strength.  She taught me not to criticize or judge others until I walked a mile in their moccasins.  I understood her lessons, because I had seven older brothers and sisters and one younger sister, and my own shoes had cutout cardboard for bottoms.  Like a sponge, I absorbed as much of my moms wisdom as I could.  
She taught me about the Bible, and to believe that God works in mysterious ways.  She let me know early on in life that man would let me down, and that I needed to put my faith and trust in the Lord.  If I trusted in the Lord, she would say, and not worry so much about what other people had, only then would I begin to see the miracles that God was performing in my own life.  She was right of course.  When I look at my own life, there are numerous times, too many to count, when my life could have, and probably should have ended, and God made a miracle happen to keep me going.  
I also learned that not all miracles are pleasant.  Unpleasant miracles are difficult for most of us to grasp.  We find it difficult to understand why a loving God would not only allow, but cause unpleasant events to happen in our lives. I questioned my mom about why bad things happened to good people and good things happened to bad people.   My moms answer was that, God allowed Jesus to die on the cross, only to raise him from the dead to glorify his own power.  She left it to me to figure out the meaning of her words.
For most of us, those with children anyway, we find it difficult to imagine allowing our child to be crucified so that the world could bear witness to our power.  God help us if our children get injured on fields of play. If our children get hurt, our hearts fill with pain and sadness, and we want the world to see us rush to comfort them.  
We grow up learning that people who love us should protect us from unpleasant events that occur daily in our own lives.  In our house, my brothers and sisters seldom felt protected.  What we felt on most days was hunger, jealousy, misery, envy and multiple kinds of abuse.  I wrote this book, because I believe that, in spite of the challenges we face and endure day after day, miracles happen every day of our lives; however, most of the time, we dont recognize them when we see them. After reading this book, my hope is that you will begin to see how God works through people to influence the lives of other people.  You will learn how to recognize Gods Perfect Timing in your own life, and to take action when the time is right.  If God can bring me through poverty, child abuse and special education, back from death and homelessness, to earning a PhD, buying several homes for my family, and sending my children to private school, then you too should be able to have faith that God has a design on your life, and has already blessed you with miracle after miracle." />
