  <title>Blessed is the man... - Petra Schaadt, Rochus Schaadt, Cordula Lavoie, Heather Fenwick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The true meaning of life cannot be found by strenuous self-effort. All attempts to establish contact with God via religious acts or good deeds are in vain. Searching for God in nature or philosophy also leads to a dead-end. People can sense that they are hopelessly cut off from God. This is why they have no inner peace. Consciously or subconsciously they embark upon a quest for him. Tormented by a yearning for paradise lost, they do everything in their power to overcome the separation between themselves and God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hand of God the Creator has left its imprint on mankind. We were created for him. The purpose of our life is not self discovery or self realization - it is to be found in God alone.&amp;nbsp;You cannot ask about the meaning of life without asking about God. It is a question each of us has to ask ... at some time or other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
