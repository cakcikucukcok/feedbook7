  <title>In Memory of the Good Old Days - Robert Lot King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Memory of the Good Old Days&lt;/i&gt; presents the inspiring memoir of Robert Lot King. After his birth in southern Indiana, he grew up mostly in rural areas and small towns. He was educated in a one-room schoolhouse with different grades in different rows. He completed his course of study to become a minister at Kentucky Mountain Bible Institute and was ordained in the Church of the Nazarene. He spent most of his life as a pastor preaching the gospel. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His memoir, presented in five parts, begins with his childhood years in the early forties, during World War II. From his near death experience at two from pin worm to the memories of his childhood in Indiana, he captures the essence of times gone but not forgotten. Part two explores the trials and victories of his journey as a preacher in the mountains of eastern Kentucky. In part three, he recalls leaving the mountains and returning to Indiana with his wife and partner in ministry. Finally, in parts four and five, he explores creation and offers proof of a living God and inspirational messages about the Christian faith. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Memory of the Good Old Days&lt;/i&gt; offers inspiring messages on faith and hope interspersed with tales of a life well lived.&lt;/p&gt;" />
