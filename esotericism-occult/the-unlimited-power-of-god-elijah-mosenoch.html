  <title>The Unlimited Power of God - Elijah Mosenoch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Unlimited Power of God
          I am fed up with the selfish life style that I am experiencing everyday and the emptiness that is accompanying it. I am curious about God and I have launched a mission to seek and find the truth about the unlimited power of God.
           My mother gives me instructions that I should follow if I want to find God. My father then takes me to the Tuskegee Veterans Administration Hospital where I begin my search for God. Once in the Tuskegee Veterans Administration Hospital I am befriended by Jenny, Thompson and Frank. The friendship between us four is short lived because due to necessary medical care and hospital regulations Thompson, Frank and Jenny have to leave. I am left all alone.
            I attend worship services that are conducted by two chaplains. Chaplain Mcnutt conducts the worship services in the morning in the chapel. The other chaplain Minister Long comes to the ward in the afternoons to sing hymns and give communion.
             Hospital regulations are trying to force me out because of its twenty-one to thirty day limits placed on patients needing short term care. I am forced into a short battle with the administration because I still need treatment on my knees.
             At my weakest and lowest point during this struggle God reveals Himself to me.
The hospital administration allows me to stay and transfers me to the long-term ward.
              Two weeks prior to being discharged from the hospital Jesus comes in and sups(dines) with me. Once discharged from the hospital God blesses me with thoughts of wisdom at times when I read. God also gives me two prayers of my own in bits and pieces." />
