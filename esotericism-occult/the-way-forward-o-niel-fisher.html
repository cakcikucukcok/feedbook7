  <title>The Way Forward - O’Niel Fisher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Confused? Frustrated? Perplexed? Youre not alone. Today these are common reactions to the often baffling world we live in. But this plague isnt restricted just to the secular world; it has seeped into the church as well.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Bible speaks out about the many pressures that would fall upon the church prior to the coming of Christ. It is amazing, though, that so many Christians have disregarded this warning from the Word of God. As a result, many have lost their sense of purpose and direction. &lt;i&gt;The Way Forward&lt;/i&gt; explores the various challenges faced by the believer and the church today. It is intended to help you better understand Gods glorious purpose for the church and your personal part in it. It will give you Gods perspective, rather than mans.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The content emphasizes the soulful plea of the called-out believer for the return to holiness, as delineated by God. The church is positioned for the most crucial stage of its human and spiritual experiencethe Lords arrival. This book seeks to be a gauge as to where one may be in Gods economy and to spiritually awaken and inspire the thirsty soul to a higher level of consciousness. The message of this book is simple: move forward and refuse to become stagnant or motionless!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In todays confusing, challenging, and directionless world, its just too easy for a person of faith to feel lost and alone. &lt;i&gt;The Way Forward&lt;/i&gt; provides inspiration to help maintain and redirect your walk with God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
