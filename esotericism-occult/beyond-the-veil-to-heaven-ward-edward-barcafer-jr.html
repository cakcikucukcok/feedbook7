  <title>Beyond the Veil to Heaven - Ward Edward Barcafer Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a book about life after death as provided to me through journaling and a series of extraordinary events by my wife, Suzette Delashmet Shockley, after her demise. I believe, and Suz (many times she and I call her Sue) as my wife believes, that if only one person can save themselves from the complete overwhelming sorrow and utter grief that comes from the death of a loved one, this whole endeavor is worthwhile. When these events started to happen, I, having not known or even thought about life after someone has passed, was in disbelief myself and turned to find out, research, and listen for answers to really see what was happening. In reading and talking with some people that did believe in life after death, I kept an open mind. As you will see, some of the events are without a doubt in my mind coming from another world. These are definite happenings that not by any common sense are able to happen in the world we live in now. As these activities happened one by one, what was happening made sense to me because as I took it as a continuing series of events, I saw something was really happening that was out of the ordinary. It was in fact very extraordinary and could not, as we know it , be of a human perspective of life on this planet. I now know that when a person loses a good friend, a spouse, a child, or other loving relationship, the deceased person can come through. I believe the stronger the love vibration between the one that has passed and the one left behind, the easier and the stronger will be the connection between them." />
