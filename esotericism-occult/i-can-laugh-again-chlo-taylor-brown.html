  <title>I Can Laugh Again - Chloé Taylor Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I  Can Laugh Again&lt;/em&gt; is all about love. It&#39;s truly an evocative story about love&#39;s essential and enduring qualities. Chloe Taylor Brown bares her soul-her dreams, hopes, losses, pains, and gains-in a riveting account you cannot read without taking part yourself in her transformation. The impetus for the narrative involves the tragic death of her nearly four-year-old son, Justin; but Justin&#39;s life is just the stepping stone, if you will, upon which she reminisces throughout her life&#39;s journey, blazing a path from rural Mississippi to the highest strata of the world of fashion. In the end, as we&#39;ve shared her passage from heartbreak to triumph, she gives us a glimpse of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My long-time friend Chloe paints a vivid and easily recognizable map to finding a practical faith. No matter the obstacles, in the end she assures us that we can trust a Power greater than ourselves to get us through, with more grace than we ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll find yourself immersed in more than one love story: a mother&#39;s abiding love for her children; Chlo&#39;s undying love for her husband, Rick, and his deep love for her; their constant love for their children and their families; and the outpouring of love from their spiritual family all over the world. Above all, there is the prevailing Power of God&#39;s redeeming Love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage you, dear reader, to accept the priceless, immeasurable, and timeless gift of reading this book. It is my prayer that you will encounter the universal language of the heart, which this memoir brings so poignantly to the surface. You&#39;ll surely gain a new appreciation for the simple values that make life worth living.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Enough said by me. Go ahead and trust your heart: Discover and rediscover the unending Power of Love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
