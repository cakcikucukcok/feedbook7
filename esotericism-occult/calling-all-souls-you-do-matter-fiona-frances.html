  <title>Calling All Souls—You Do Matter! - Fiona Frances</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Regardless of our education and social upbringing, we haven&#39;t been given some of the basic principles that life demands from us. We are told what to learn, what to believe and what not-to-do. We are only given bits and pieces about developing our individual spirit and character. We all have an inner-life and it is a matter of paying attention to it and giving it strength. Everything we think, say and do affects us in ways we are not aware of and need to be very conscious and selective. By going within for spiritual nourishment and strength, we can teach ourselves to use our own ingenuity, to access our character building blocks and to co-create our best self and life. 
&lt;i&gt;Calling All SoulsYou Do Matter!&lt;/i&gt; offers a uniquely eclectic collection of wisdom, common sense and golden rules that will lighten and inspire your souls journey here on Earth. It will guide you in the co-creation of your best-self and best-life by teaching you to trust in your intuition, to create a life-plan, and to act on inspired guidance. You will learn that what you focus on and what you commit to is what will bring the results you seek. Positive thoughts create positive actions. And by simply making the choices that are right for you, you co-create your happiness and success in life. You define you! You and only you decide upon your life&#39;s mission and purpose. There is a great goodness about what you can bring into the world.  It is up to you to allow good things to come to you. The point of your life is to understand that!
&lt;i&gt;You do matter, you do count and you are loved very much by your Creator. You are very important here on this earth and at this time. Your spirit-soul has been placed here for a reasonto learn something, to share something, to teach something.  You have been blessed with special gifts and talents that only you can open and share with the world. Your gift back is what you have created with your skills and talents. The happiest people in the world are those who follow their passion. &lt;/i&gt;
A Spiritual path is a path of self-awareness and personal growth. Learning to love and accept yourself is the key to spiritual integrity and happiness. Our spirit is our creative imprint from the Divine and we are all blessed with this creative energy. We have the choice to create a beautiful spiritual existence for ourselves each and every morning." />
