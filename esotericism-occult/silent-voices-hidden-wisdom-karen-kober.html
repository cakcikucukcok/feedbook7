  <title>Silent Voices Hidden Wisdom - Karen Kober</title>
      <meta name="description" content="SILENT VOICES
HIDDEN WISDOM
Is it fearful, the unknown silent voices so long hidden?
Or to hold all the emotions of sentient life?
Telepathy is thought transference of mental energy from one being to another.  Humans use telepathic energy constantly.  We are aware the voice in our mind is never silent. We are unaware of our capability to use telepathic energy with intent. We use it every day and often do not recognize our oldest form of communication.
Animals vocal cords, due to their physical structure, were not able to attain formed language as humans did.  They continue to express themselves telepathically or with behavior when humans deny to acknowledge their inner ability to hear them telepathically.
Discover the widening scope of using telepathic communication in our daily life.  We would discover there are no secrets in the thread of life!  Just imagine using telepathy to converse with all creation on earth, in heaven or other dimensions.  The messages received are the wisdom of the ages and encompass the full spectrum of eternity.
Telepathically conversing with sentient beings in all dimensions is funny, surprisingly delightful and compassionate.  The silent voices impart wisdom and guidance in every moment of our everyday life.
Our mind seeks a place for discovery in curiosity.  The silent voices and  hidden wisdom within us holds the key to answers from all dimensions.
Journey the joy and hidden wisdom in the silent voices, in their words and prayers." />
