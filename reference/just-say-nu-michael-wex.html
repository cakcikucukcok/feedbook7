      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A cross between Henry Beard&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Latin for All Occasions&lt;/i&gt; and Ben Schott&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Schott&#39;s Original Miscellany&lt;/i&gt;, JUST SAY NU is a practical guide to using Yiddish words and expressions in day-to-day situations. Along with enough grammar to enable readers to put together a comprehensible sentence and avoid embarrassing mistakes, Wex also explains the five most useful Yiddish words-&lt;i&gt;shoyn, nu, epes, takeh,&lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; nebakh&lt;/i&gt;-what they mean, how and when to use them, and how they can be used to conduct an entire conversation without anybody ever suspecting that the reader doesn&#39;t have the vaguest idea of what anyone is actually saying. Readers will learn how to &lt;i&gt;shmooze&lt;/i&gt; their way through such activities as meeting and greeting; eating and drinking; praising and finding fault; maintaining personal hygiene; going to the doctor; driving; parenting; getting horoscopes; committing crimes; going to singles bars; having sex; talking politics and talking trash.&lt;br&gt;Now that Stephen Colbert, a Catholic from South Carolina and host of the &quot;Colbert Report,&quot; is using Yiddish to wish viewers a bright and happy Chanukah, people have finally started to realize that there&#39;s nothing in the world that can&#39;t be improved by translating it into Yiddish. Wex&#39;s JUST SAY NU is the book that&#39;s going to show them how.&lt;/p&gt;" />
