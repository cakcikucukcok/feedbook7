  <title>Daniel in the Lion&#39;s Den - Daniel William Heard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;They joy of writing &quot;Daniel In The Lion&#39;s Den&quot; is only surpassed by the daily joy of helping others, as I go beside the patients and their families, at Detroit Receiving Hospital. God is always with me, as I work along side the nurses and doctors, in one of the busiest Emergency Departments in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I began my position as Patient Advocate, in 2009, I took note daily of heart wrenching stories, strength of faith at the darkest hours, and God&#39;s hand in healing. My wife, Paula, suggested that I keep a log of many of the stories that developed. Every night brought something new. I was in complete awe of our entire staff at Detroit Receiving Hospital, not only the doctors and nurses, but the clerks, registration personnel, and security officers as well. Remarkably, I was widely accepted by that staff, and soon felt very much at home, as I worked beside them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories I have to tell are actual life and death accounts, seen through the eyes of a Patient Advocate. The Emergency Department at Detroit Receiving Hospital can be horrifying, but it can also be a place of incredible mercy. It is a place of refuge for many who might be homeless, seriously ill or injured. It is, for some, the last place they will ever visit...alive. The pain and the grief here can be overwhelming, but as you read these stories you will find joy and healing. God&#39;s work here is unmistakable. I hope you see His hand, as i did, and just as Daniel did in the Biblical &quot;Lion&#39;s Den&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
