      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Craft a Story That Towers Above the Rest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You know it when you read it: In page after page and scene after scene, a truly engrossing novel has qualities that set it apart. Authentic characters, a well-rounded plot, and immersive settings work in harmony to create a three-dimensional experience--one you can practically step inside and explore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But while you can recognize this work when you read it, writing it can be much more challenging. &lt;i&gt;Bring Your Fiction to Life&lt;/i&gt; teaches you how to build a solid narrative structure and layer in lush, textured scenes to create a story that rings true. You&amp;#39;ll learn how to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Master the three-dimensional aspects of characters, plots, and settings using detailed sketches that define the past, present, and future aspects of each element.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop complex opening, resolution, and bridge scenes that expertly lead readers through your fictional world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Construct and analyze an outline for your manuscript, using tools and techniques to analyze scenes that lack dimensionality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brainstorm, research, and draft efficiently and effectively, and juggle multiple projects with ease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Packed with story-development charts, worksheets, and checklists, &lt;i&gt;Bring Your Fiction to Life&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to craft a vivid story world that readers will instantly recognize as remarkable.&lt;/div&gt;" />
