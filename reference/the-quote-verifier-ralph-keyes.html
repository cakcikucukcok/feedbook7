  <title>The Quote Verifier - Ralph Keyes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our language is full of hundreds of quotations that are often cited but seldom confirmed. Ralph Keyes&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Quote Verifier &lt;/i&gt;considers not only classic misquotes such as &quot;Nice guys finish last,&quot; and &quot;Play it again, Sam,&quot; but more surprising ones such as &quot;Ain&#39;t I a woman?&quot; and &quot;Golf is a good walk spoiled,&quot; as well as the origins of popular sayings such as &quot;The opera ain&#39;t over till the fat lady sings,&quot; &quot;No one washes a rented car,&quot; and &quot;Make my day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keyes&#39;s in-depth research routinely confounds widespread assumptions about who said what, where, and when. Organized in easy-to-access dictionary form, &lt;i&gt;The Quote Verifier&lt;/i&gt; also contains special sections highlighting commonly misquoted people and genres, such as Yogi Berra and Oscar Wilde, famous last words, and misremembered movie lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An invaluable resource for not just those with a professional need to quote accurately, but anyone at all who is interested in the roots of words and phrases, &lt;i&gt;The Quote Verifier&lt;/i&gt; is not only a fascinating piece of literary sleuthing, but also a great read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
