  <title>&quot;Cut from the Same Cloth&quot; - C.A. Hawkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cynthias parents migrated, during the 1940s, moving from Texas to California, shortly after World War II. She was born in 1948, growing up in Berkeley, California. She came from a close-knit, hardworking family. She grew up hearing stories of family members and of times long ago in the lumber mill towns located in East Texas. She writes about the little known, experiences of her relatives who worked and lived in the lumber mill towns. These towns were isolated little communities cut off from mainstream society. 
Cynthia was educated in Northern California schools and attended local community colleges. She describes herself as the self-designated, family historian and photographer. Older family members would bequeath to her family heirlooms, artifacts and photographs. She became intrigued by the people in the pictures, of places, of another time. Her love of books and the lifelong desire of owning a bookstore became a reality, during 1992-1996. She planned events for nationally known authors to book signings and other appearances; some were hosted by nearby Solano College.  Once retiring from her position as a Human Resources Administrator at a nearby health agency in 2005, she resumed her other dream of researching her familys history. 
Cynthias most notable accomplishments have been to add more branches to her family tree and she currently provides instruction and workshops at local libraries. One major accomplishment as a result of the workshops has been the formation of a local discussion group, the African American Genealogical Society of Solano County, established in March 2009, from participants of the workshops.  The group provides workshops, guest speakers and seminars. The most recent inclusion into the African American Genealogical Society of Northern California has broadened the opportunities and resources to all interested in researching family history." />
