However, it has hitherto been depicted in a misleading manner, by portraying men as always the perpetrators and women always the victims. This book is packed with factual evidence that shows that men are also victims of domestic violence perpetrated by their wives or female partners, and in high numbers. It thus dispels this old misleading stereotype and establishes that domestic violence is not a gender issue as heretofore portrayed, but a social issue and one capable of being perpetrated by either partner in an intimate relationship. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
