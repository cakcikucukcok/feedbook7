Fortunately, it&#39;s not too late and we can still change which is why many are pushing for green energy sources. The advantage of using green energy sources is that it is clean so it does not emit anything harmful into the air which has an impact on the environment. It is also renewable which means we will never run out of it unlike oil which is expected to dry up in a decade or so. Although green energy facilities are expensive to build, it requires less maintenance so you don&#39;t have to shell out a lot of money to operate it. For a very long time, we have relied on fossil fuels. It provides heat to our homes, gas for our cars and electricity. Since we are now using it more than ever, there is a consequence. We are depleting our resources and slowly killing our planet. Fortunately, we can change our ways and then shift our attention to green energy sources." />
