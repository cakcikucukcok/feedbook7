  <title>International Law for Seagoing Officers - Craig H. Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;For those who operate on, under and over the sea, international law can sometimes be as complex as it is important. Written by the same former seagoing officer and maritime law professional who authored the current edition of &lt;I&gt;Farwell&#39;s Rules of the Nautical Road&lt;/I&gt;, this book was designed to bring clarity and context to international law for the seagoing professional. Following an introduction to public international law and a short history of the law of the sea, the book describes the rules that apply in ports and in the adjacent maritime zones, including the territorial sea, exclusive economic zone, archipelagic waters and the high seas. A highlight of the book are the chapters that focus on the subjects of greatest interest to the seagoing professional, including military and intelligence activities in the maritime domain, maritime law enforcement activities and the use of force at sea. The appendices include the text of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Whether an academy cadet, a midshipman, a seasoned commanding officer, or a master mariner, readers of this thorough and timely book will be rewarded with a far greater understanding of the international laws that govern ships and mariners at sea.&lt;/div&gt;" />
