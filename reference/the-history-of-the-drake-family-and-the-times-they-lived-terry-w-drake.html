  <title>The History of the Drake Family and the Times They Lived - Terry W. Drake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This history takes factual information provided by encyclopedias and other historical documents. Other reference material includes birth certificates, death certificates and census data which support the factual basis of this history. The war records and military history of individuals and their family members were also used in the determination of their contributions to the society in which they lived. Other research material included Wikipedia, Ancetry.com, wikitree.com, genealogy.com family bibles and my many brothers and sisters.
Two directions of ancestry history were investigated to gain the most effective approach to the design of this history. First the genealogy of Amye Grenville was traced to her origin of Charlemagne. Her marriage to John Drake VI allowed further investigation into his ancestry. Both were thoroughly pursued with vigor to determine their origins over the last 1300 years. The investigation provided by Earl Drake combined with my efforts has provided this history for your enjoyment." />
