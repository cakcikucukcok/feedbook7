  <title>The Power Within - Torin M. Lee, Michelle S. Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Two experts in business communications have written a practical, concise
guide on how internal communications can and should be a strategic business
investment -- all in direct and plain language. This is a focused approach where
business leaders and communications professionals alike are guided through
the process and the logic that the authors have used to help increase revenue
exponentially and decrease time to reach business objectives by up to 50
percent. Underlying Michelle S. Morris and Torin M. Lees The Power Within
is a winning book on power. The power of getting the attention, capturing the
imagination, and aligning an entire workforce behind the direction the leader
wants to go. The authors persuasively argue that internal communications is
a key pillar in the foundation of an effective and successful business. They
go several steps further on the road by sharing this focused and measurable
approach, an approach that says communications itself is part of the framework
for business success." />
