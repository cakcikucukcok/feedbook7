  <title>The Estranged Family of Abraham&#39;s God - J. Grathmore Stratus Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Estranged Family of Abraham&#39;s God&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Grathmore Stratus III&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The topic of Arab-Israeli and Christian relations often invokes strong emotions and frequent hostility. It entails extremely sensitive subject matter and cuts deep to the essence of religious beliefs, loyalties, and sometimes mortal commitments. Anyone who follows international media realizes that every family on Earth is, or somehow might be, either directly or indirectly affected by a situation that is ever expanding from the Middle East. If visiting from another planet, it might appear as though Earth was inhabited by one very large dysfunctioning family. Unlike others who have addressed this issue, J. Grathmore Stratus III does not imply what anyone should believe or what to conclude. Looking through the lens of the family microscope, J. Grathmore Stratus III provides a fresh new perspective to viewing international relations. This study presents considerations that seem to be overlooked by many authors attempting to analyze ancient rivalries that continue to shape the history of mankind. In the process, readers and listeners gain insight into their own family matters, along with hope for reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/br&gt;" />
