  <title>Success Mindset: The Psychology of Success Revealed - Martin Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why does it always come back to the ageless truths? Mostly because that which is truth is ageless and truth doesn&#39;t change with the wind. &quot;The Right Philosophy&quot; can be defined by any number of phrases, but it always comes back to the &quot;golden rule.&quot; It&#39;s re-phrased, but the essence is the same:  You can have whatever you want in life if you will just help others get what it is that they want. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard the expression &quot;in the zone,&quot; particularly as it applies to athletes or others who are unflappable as they eye the goal. Sometimes you can be in the zone regarding your success and nothing gets in your way; other times you can do everything right and find that whatever can go wrong, will. Here are thoughts on building the habit of success and getting &quot;in the zone.&quot;   Without character, the puzzle of achieving success falls apart. It is most important of all pieces to life&#39;s puzzle. Without character, you can make money. But it will be worthless to you and to those around you." />
