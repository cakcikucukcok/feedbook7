  <title>Skills I Wish I Learned in School: Building a Research Paper - Nicole M.C. Lusiani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most college professors assume students entering higher education come with research and writing skills; because of the current educational focus on content acquisition over skill development, however, that is not the case. Skills I Wish I Learned in School: Building a Research Paper was written in direct response to the need new college students have for specific skills left out by current high school teaching standards, especially in the area of social studies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written in an easy to follow, step-by-step manner, Skills I Wish I Learned in School: Building a Research Paper is a fantastic resource for new college students who need a frame of reference for how to research and write a college-level paper. Differentiation is provided for different learning styles; an appendix of reproducible handouts offers students an additional layer of support. If that was not enough, references for where to find additional information in areas such as writing and citations are also included. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This all-inclusive handbook helps students break down the daunting task of research in ways that feel doable, and then moves them forward through a comforting structure that gets them to their end goal successfully. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Skills I Wish I Learned in School: Building a Research Paper is a valuable tool for educators who want to give their high school students a chance to develop these skills before they graduate; more so, Skills I Wish I Learned in School: Building a Research Paper is a must have for any student entering college." />
