  <title>Things I Wish I Knew Before My Mom Died - Ty Alexander, Tia Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;#1 Amazon Best Seller&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Coping With Loss&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The grieving process:&lt;/b&gt; Ty Alexander of &lt;i&gt;Gorgeous in Grey&lt;/i&gt; is one of the top bloggers today. She has a tremendous personal connection with her readers. This is never more apparent than when she speaks about her mother. The pain of loss is universal. Yet, we all grieve differently. For Alexander, the grieving process is one that she lives with day-to-day. Learning from her pain, Alexander connects with her readers on a deeply emotional level in her debut book, &lt;i&gt;Things I Wish I Knew before My Mom Died: Coping with Loss Every Day&lt;/i&gt;. From grief counseling to sharing insightful true stories, Alexander offers comfort, reassurance, and hope in the face of sorrow. 
&lt;b&gt;Coping with loss:&lt;/b&gt; In her early 20’s reality smacked Ty in the face. She was ill equipped to deal with the emotional and intellectual rollercoaster of dealing with her mom’s illness.  Through her own trial and error, she found a way to be a caregiver, patient advocate, researcher, and a grieving daughter.  She wrote &lt;i&gt;Things I Wish I Knew before My Mom Died: Coping with Loss Every Day&lt;/i&gt; to help others find the  “best” way to cope and move on, however one personally decides what that means.
&lt;b&gt;Mourning and remembrance:&lt;/b&gt; In the chapters of this soul-touching book, mourners will find meaning and wisdom in grieving and the love that will always remain. Each chapter is a study and lesson in coping with loss:
     •   Chapter 1: We’ve been duped, everyone dies! 
     •   Chapter 2: The truth about my moderately dysfunctional family 
     •   Chapter 3: The Art Of Losing 
     •   Chapter 4: The how of grieving 
     •   Chapter 5: How to be obsessively grateful  
     •   Chapter 6: Dear Mama" />
