  <title>Trail of Broken Promises - Caleb Pirtle III</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It may have been the greatest injustice of all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A nation was uprooted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A nation was ripped apart from its ancestral lands with its peoples&amp;#39; feet pointed west.  So many died along the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Five Civilized Tribes &amp;ndash; the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, Cherokee, and Seminole &amp;ndash; rose to power on the land of their fathers, atop great smoky mountains, deep within vast timbered forests, lost among the mangroves, palmettos, and rivers of grass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They were strong and proud &amp;ndash; hunters who had become farmers. Many fine plantations were firmly planted on the land they called home, and slaves picked their cotton in the fields.
