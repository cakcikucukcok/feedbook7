  <title>Pride in the Past--Faith in the Future - The University Club of Winter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The initial published history of the University Club of Winter Park was recorded in the book The First Twenty-Five Years (1959), which was later incorporated into another book, Sixty Years in Review (1994). Thus, the complete history of the Club from 1934 to 1994 was compiled in these two books. They are in the Club Library. 
The ad hoc History Book Committees task of writing this latest history was to preserve the past history, to research noteworthy material in the archives and files and Board minutes from 1994 to 2010, and to integrate new information into the format of Sixty Years in Review.
There is no single author of this book. It is the result of the written contributions of the committee members, based on Board minutes and other research, and anecdotal reminiscences by Club Presidents Emeriti." />
