  <title>1335 days - djordjo Suvajlo, Jovana Varagic, Linda Perovic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The book &amp;quot;1335 days&amp;quot; is untold story about Bosnian Civil War 1992-1996...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the civil war, Djordjo, a civilian, was taken by his Muslim neighbours and imprisoned in a concentration camp known as Silos in the town of Tarcin. He washeld in Silos for 1335 days until the end of the war in 1996 Despite ongoing physical and psychological torture, Djordjo survived. After his release, Djordjo was reunited with his family and together they migrated to Australia.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
He arrived in Australia with just $120 given to him by the UN for travelling expenses. Djordjo and his family quickly settled into the Australian way of life and were accepted with kindness by the Australian people.&amp;nbsp; His greatest satisfaction came from his daughters graduating from university.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
This book is a shocking recount of the torturous days he spent in the concentration camp, Silos, and the total collapse of humanity. The book also details Djordjo&amp;rsquo;s miraculous survival.&lt;/p&gt;" />
