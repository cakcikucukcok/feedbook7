  <title>Churchill&#39;s Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare - Giles Milton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Six gentlemen, one goal: the destruction of Hitler&#39;s war machine&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 1939, a top-secret organization was founded in London:  its purpose was to plot the destruction of Hitler&#39;s war machine through  spectacular acts of sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The guerrilla campaign that  followed was every bit as extraordinary as the six men who directed it.  One of them, Cecil Clarke, was a maverick engineer who had spent the  1930s inventing futuristic caravans. Now, his talents were put to more  devious use: he built the dirty bomb used to assassinate Hitler&#39;s  favorite, Reinhard Heydrich. Another, William Fairbairn, was a portly  pensioner with an unusual passion: he was the world&#39;s leading expert in  silent killing, hired to train the guerrillas being parachuted behind  enemy lines. Led by dapper Scotsman Colin Gubbins, these men--along with  three others--formed a secret inner circle that, aided by a group of  formidable ladies, single-handedly changed the course Second World War: a  cohort hand-picked by Winston Churchill, whom he called his  Ministry  of Ungentlemanly Warfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giles Milton&#39;s&lt;i&gt; Churchill&#39;s Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping and  vivid narrative of adventure and derring-do that is also, perhaps, the  last great untold story of the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;" />
