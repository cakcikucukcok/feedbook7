  <title>The Guide to the American Revolutionary War at Sea: Vol. 7 1782, 1783 and Overseas - Norman Desmarais</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guide to the American Revolutionary War at Sea and Overseas&lt;/em&gt; chronicles more than 10,500 actions -- far more than other naval histories. Vol. 7 documents 1430 naval actions which occurred in 1782, 263 actions which occurred in 1783 and 116 actions which occurred overseas. It ends in June 1783 after the signing of the peace treaty and includes some actions fought after the signing of the peace treaty which resulted in the release of prisoners when the participants learned of the cessation of hostilities. It includes the actions of the Continental and state navies, the French and British navies, the actions of American and British privateers and those of their allies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;In addition to the engagements in the Atlantic Ocean, along the American and European coasts and in the West Indies, there are accounts of actions in the South Pacific, the Mediterranean and North Seas and the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The accounts are arranged chronologically and are drawn from ship&amp;rsquo;s logs, prize lists, Admiralty court and auction records, newspaper accounts, letters, diaries, personal journals and pension applications.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This work would interest educated readers in history, especially naval historians and those interested in the Revolutionary War and eighteenth century history. Students of military studies and those interested in historical tourism would be particularly interested as would libraries, particularly military academies, historical and genealogical societies and museums dealing with maritime matters.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
