  <title>Neutral Ireland and the Third Reich - John P. Duggan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this work based on original research into German sources, John Duggan opens up an entirely new perspective on the little-known history of Ireland during the &#39;Emergency&#39; period of the Second World War. Reviews of the hardcover edition: &#39;This important new book amplifies and illustrates our understanding of Irish neutrality [and] brings life to many of the peripheral characters in the wartime drama ... sensitive, objective and fair-minded.&#39; – Maurice Manning, &#39;Hibernia&#39;. &#39;A blow-by-blow account of the Third Reich&#39;s handling of Irish neutrality ... gives us fascinating glimpses of the intrigues and plots on the Irish as well as the German side.&#39; – Joe Carroll, &#39;Sunday Press&#39;. Colonel Duggan has done a good job with this book ... He has a keen sense of history, and shows a mastery of research, objectivity and a capacity to comprehend source material in different languages. Few historians have grappled with the German side of the story. This book will interest not only the serious scholars, but anyone who lived through the perilous days of the Emergency.&#39; – Desmond T. Williams &#39;Irish Press&#39;. &#39;A most welcome addition towards solving the historical jigsaw of the Emergency.&#39; – Peter Young, &#39;An Cosantòir&#39;. &#39;Greatly enriches our understanding of the Irish dimension ... a fresh and valuable addition to the growing literature on neutrality ... Mr Duggan combines scholarly zest with a keen sense of the absurd in human behaviour.&#39; John A. Murphy, &#39;Sunday Independent&#39;." />
