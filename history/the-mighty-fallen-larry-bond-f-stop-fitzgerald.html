  <title>The Mighty Fallen - Larry Bond, f-stop Fitzgerald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mighty Fallen&lt;/em&gt; is a beautiful, evocative presentation of more than 150 never-before-seen photographs of the nation&#39;s greatest monuments and war memorials, along with text that describes the memorials and tells their stories. This extraordinary collection calls attention to the power of memory and the ways in which we immortalize people and events. As Larry Bond notes in the Introduction, &quot;Memories of a war or battle are unpleasant, but few veterans would want them erased.&quot; This book is a unique tribute to veterans and a commemoration of some of the most significant conflicts in our history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most battlefields leave little record of the historic confrontations that occurred there. Those who fought in epic struggles want us to remember not just the outcome, but the cost of victory and those who paid the price for the freedoms we enjoy today. Memories fade, so we raise monuments of stone and bronze to carry their message of sacrifice through the centuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iwo Jima Memorial and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC are instantly recognizable, but there are monuments all over North America honoring more than 300 years of military service. &lt;em&gt;The Mighty Fallen&lt;/em&gt; shows you hundreds of monuments, memorials, and statues conveying the message their designers wanted you to hear&amp;#8212;these are more than just a date and location.&lt;/p&gt;" />
