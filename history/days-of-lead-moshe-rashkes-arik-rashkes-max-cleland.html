  <title>Days of Lead - Moshe Rashkes, Arik Rashkes, Max Cleland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;#1 Best Seller - Over 50,000 Copies Sold&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;
	Hailed by the likes of Israel&amp;rsquo;s founder David Ben-Gurion, &lt;em&gt;Days of Lead&lt;/em&gt; is a gripping best seller recounting the author&amp;rsquo;s life on the front line during Israel&amp;rsquo;s War of Independence and is internationally released for the first time in conjunction with Israel&amp;rsquo;s 70th birthday.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;
	Exquisitely written with a poetically beautiful touch, &lt;em&gt;Days of Lead&lt;/em&gt; is the page-turning true story of a young soldier&amp;rsquo;s brave escapades during Israel&amp;rsquo;s War of Independence in 1948. This incredible account, an immediate best seller in Israel on its release in 1962 and destined to be celebrated internationally for years to come, is a story of determination and heroism, but also a stinging portrait of life on the battlefield&amp;mdash;of looking an enemy soldier, also wide-eyed and only eighteen, in the eyes and knowing that it&amp;rsquo;s his life or yours, either you take a life or you lose yours. Far from a regular coming-of-age story, this is a firsthand account of a young man trying desperately to save the lives of his fellow soldiers, but watching them taken down one-by-one until he&amp;rsquo;s the last man alive on his platoon. It&amp;rsquo;s heartrending, but enthralling.&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;
	This new edition of &lt;em&gt;Days of Lead&lt;/em&gt;, published in English and internationally released for the first time, provides an up-close view of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv long before they became the bustling cities we know today. It also presents fascinating, never-before-shared context on the making of the book and its enduring relevancy, as Israeli soldiers continue to fight for Israel&amp;rsquo;s right to exist.&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;
	In a personal letter to the author, Israel&amp;rsquo;s founder and first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, one of many well-known celebrators of the book, writes, &amp;ldquo;I started reviewing your book without the intention of reading to its end, but from the first pages I was captivated and I read it to the end through excitement and astonishment. From where all the sudden pops up such mighty expression, truth telling, and wonderful description? It seems to me that until now I have not read such a precise and true story of combat from the War of Independence. . . . You have contributed a valuable asset . . . to our literature at large.&amp;rdquo;
