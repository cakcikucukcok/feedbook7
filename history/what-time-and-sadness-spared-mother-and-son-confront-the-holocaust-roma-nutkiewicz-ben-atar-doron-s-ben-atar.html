  <title>What Time and Sadness Spared: Mother and Son Confront the Holocaust - Roma Nutkiewicz Ben-Atar, Doron S. Ben-Atar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Roma Ben-Atar resisted until late in life the urging of her family to share the     memories of her Nazi-era experiences. The Holocaust exerted a dark pressure on all of their     lives but was never openly discussed. It was only when her granddaughter insisted on hearing the     whole truth, with a directness partly generational, that Mrs. Ben-Atar agreed to tell her     story.&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;What Time and Sadness Spared&lt;/i&gt; is a journey of both loss and     endurance, moving with shocking speed from a carefree adolescence in upper-middle-class Warsaw     to the horrors of the Final Solution. The young girl sees her neighborhood transformed into a     ghetto populated by skeletal figures both alive and dead. Unbelievably, things only grow worse     as this ruin gives way to the death factories of Majdanek and Auschwitz and the death marches of     1945. Life in the camps changes her in less than a day, as if &quot;the person in my body was a     stranger I had never met.&quot; Her only consolation is to lie on her wooden bunk, no mattress, and     speak to the soul of her mother, who, like virtually her entire family, had already been swept     away. Roma must summon astonishing powers of adaptation simply to survive, bringing her finally     through the wreckage of postwar Europe and to an entirely new life in Israel.&lt;p&gt;In this     unique family collaboration Roma Ben-Atar&#39;s son Doron, a historian who brings with him fluency     in psychoanalysis, contributes through his commentary an awareness of the difficulties presented     by historical narrative and memory. A visitor to the much-changed sites in which his mother grew     up and was interned by the Nazis, he also voices the perspective of the survivors&#39; children and     their ambivalence over being &quot;protected&quot; from this past. As the generation that endured the     camps passes from this world, What Time and Sadness Spared illustrates with particular urgency     the historical responsibilities of the survivors&#39; descendants, who must become the new vessels     for a story that will not remain alive on its own but demands our courage and     curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
