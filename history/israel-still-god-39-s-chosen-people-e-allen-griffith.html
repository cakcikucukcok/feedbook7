  <title>Israel, STILL God&#39;s Chosen People - E. Allen Griffith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The nation of Israel is among the smaller nations of the world. It ranks 154&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in size and 97&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in population. Yet, it is one of the most well-known of all countries and finds its way into the evening news on a regular basis. Its history is unique, going back to 2,000 BC, when Abraham, the father of the nation left his kindred and his homeland of Mesopotamia to travel to what was then the land of Canaan. While his descendants vacated the land of their own accord, they ended up as a slave nation to Egypt and never returned for 400 years. They came out of Egypt determined to claim the Land they believed had been given to them by God. For centuries the Jewish people enjoyed and endured various measures of success in maintaining control of the land, their sacred possession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1948, the Jewish people reclaimed the land after almost 2,000 years of exile. Israel now stands as an independent Jewish State. It ranks among the most powerful nations of the world. It enjoys incredible economic success through agricultural, industrial, scientific, and educational innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, does this nation have a future based on the promises of God found in the Bible? Is there a pathway for the future laid out in the prophetic teachings of the Word of God? Has Israel been set aside and in some way replaced by the Church, as some would teach? Israel, &lt;em&gt;Still&lt;/em&gt; God&amp;rsquo;s Chosen People, presents the biblical message regarding Israel&amp;rsquo;s past, present and future. This yields to a discussion of the end of the current age, when Jesus Christ will return to take His saints to glory, before the final chapter of God&amp;rsquo;s plan for Israel&lt;/p&gt;" />
