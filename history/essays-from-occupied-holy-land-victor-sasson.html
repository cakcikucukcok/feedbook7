  <title>Essays from Occupied Holy Land - Victor Sasson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Essays From Occupied Holy Land&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; exposes and demolishes malignant, oft-repeated Zionist propaganda myths. The truth is: Zionism is not Judaism, criticism of Israel is not anti-Semitism, Middle Eastern Jews were not expelled from their homelands, Israelis do not seek peace. 
The founders of the militaristic Zionist State and their successors  Yiddish speakers, of mixed Slavic-Germanic and other non-Semitic origins  have deceptively hid behind a religious smoke-screen aimed at covering up their colonial and apartheid policies and practices. They managed  with American help  to create a Philistine colony in the Semitic heartland of the Near East, falsely claiming a return to an ancestral homeland. The biblical, messianic Return of the Exiles, however, speaks of the return of Semitic, Near Eastern Jews  a return which would be realised through peaceful, just means, not through wars, dispossession of the Palestinians, and the cultural  and eventual ethnic  cleansing of Sephardi-Babylonian Jewry.  But the writing on the wall is clear and requires little interpretation.
Personal, moral, and literary in character, &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Essays From Occupied Holy Land&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; presents an indictment of a rogue, bellicose, Philistine State that is foreign to the Near East and its Biblical and Semitic history and culture." />
