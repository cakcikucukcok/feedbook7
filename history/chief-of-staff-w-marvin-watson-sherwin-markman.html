  <title>Chief of Staff - W. Marvin Watson, Sherwin Markman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Chief of Staff to the President is perhaps the most important political appointment in our nation&#39;s government. Aside from handling the myriad of day to day details that keep the White House running, the Chief of Staff is often the President&#39;s closest confidante and gatekeeper--anyone who wants access to the Oval Office goes through the Chief of Staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Lyndon Johnson bestrode the American political scene as a colossus of energy, ambition, and purpose. He attempted to achieve no less then the total eradication of poverty and expended every last ounce of his political capitol with Congress to pass Civil Rights legislation. And, throughout, he was--as he knew better than anyone else--being destroyed by a war he inherited, detested, and could do nothing to stop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With W. Marvin Watson, his Chief of Staff and most intimate adviser, finally revealing what he knows about this extraordinary figure, readers are taken, firsthand, inside the presidential life and times of Lyndon Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;" />
