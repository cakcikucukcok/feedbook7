  <title>Mary Ball Washington - Craig Shirley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mother of the Father of our Country. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Ball Washington was an unlikely candidate to be the mother of history&amp;#8217;s most famous revolutionary. In fact, George Washington&amp;#8217;s first fight for independence was from his controlling, singular mother. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stubborn, aristocratic Mary Ball Washington was entrenched in the Old World ways of her ancestors, dismissing the American experiment even as her son led the successful rebellion against the crown. During his youth, ambitious George dove into the hard-scrabble work of a surveyor and rose through the ranks of the fledgling colonial army, even as his overprotective mother tried to discourage these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary&amp;#8217;s influence on George was twofold. Though she raised her eldest son to become one of the world&amp;#8217;s greatest leaders, Mary also tried many times to hold him back. While she passed down her strength and individuality to George, she also sought to protect him from the risks he needed to take to become a daring general and president. But it was this resistance itself which fanned the spark of George&amp;#8217;s independence into a flame. The constant tug of war between the two throughout the early years helped define George&amp;#8217;s character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Mary Ball Washington&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Craig Shirley uncovers startling details about the inner workings of the Washington family. He vividly brings to life a resilient widow who singlehandedly raised six children and ran a large farm at a time when most women&amp;#8217;s duties were relegated to household matters. Throughout, Shirley compares and contrasts mother and son, illuminating the qualities they shared and the differences that divided them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A significant contribution to American history, &lt;em&gt;Mary Ball Washington&lt;/em&gt; is the definitive take on the relationship between George and Mary Washington, offering fresh insight into this extraordinary figure who would shape our nation&amp;#8212;and the woman who shaped him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
