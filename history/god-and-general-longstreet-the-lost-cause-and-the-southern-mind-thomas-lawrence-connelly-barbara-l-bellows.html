  <title>God and General Longstreet: The Lost Cause and the Southern Mind - Thomas Lawrence Connelly, Barbara L. Bellows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;More than a century after Appomattox, the Civil War and the idea of the&lt;br&gt;                &quot;Lost Cause&quot; remain at the center of the southern mind. God and General&lt;br&gt;                Longstreet traces the persistence and the transformation of the Lost Cause from the&lt;br&gt;                first generation of former Confederates to more recent times, when the Lost Cause&lt;br&gt;                has continued to endure in the commitment of southerners to their regional&lt;br&gt;                culture.&lt;br&gt;Southern writers from the Confederate period through the&lt;br&gt;                southern renascence and into the 1970s fostered the Lost Cause, creating an image of&lt;br&gt;                the South that was at once romantic and tragic. By examining the work of these&lt;br&gt;                writers, Thomas Connelly and Barbara Bellows explain why the nation embraced this&lt;br&gt;                image and outline the evolution of the Lost Cause mentality from its origins in the&lt;br&gt;                South&#39;s surrender to its role in a century?long national expression of defeat that&lt;br&gt;                extended from 1865 through the Vietnam War. As Connelly and Bellows demonstrate, the&lt;br&gt;                Lost Cause was a realization of mortality in an American world striving for&lt;br&gt;                perfection, an admission of failure juxtaposed against a national faith in&lt;br&gt;                success.&lt;/p&gt;" />
