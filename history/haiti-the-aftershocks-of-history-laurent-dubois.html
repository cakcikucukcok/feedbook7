  <title>Haiti: The Aftershocks of History - Laurent Dubois</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A passionate and insightful account by a leading historian of Haiti that traces the sources of the country&#39;s devastating present back to its turbulent and traumatic history&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before the 2010 earthquake destroyed much of the country, Haiti was known as a benighted place of poverty and corruption. Maligned and misunderstood, the nation has long been blamed by many for its own wretchedness. But as acclaimed historian Laurent Dubois makes clear, Haiti&#39;s troubled present can only be understood by examining its complex past. The country&#39;s difficulties are inextricably rooted in its founding revolution--the only successful slave revolt in the history of the world; the hostility that this rebellion generated among the colonial powers surrounding the island nation; and the intense struggle within Haiti itself to define its newfound freedom and realize its promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dubois vividly depicts the isolation and impoverishment that followed the 1804 uprising. He details how the crushing indemnity imposed by the former French rulers initiated a devastating cycle of debt, while frequent interventions by the United States--including a twenty-year military occupation--further undermined Haiti&#39;s independence. At the same time, Dubois shows, the internal debates about what Haiti should do with its hard-won liberty alienated the nation&#39;s leaders from the broader population, setting the stage for enduring political conflict. Yet as Dubois demonstrates, the Haitian people have never given up on their struggle for true democracy, creating a powerful culture insistent on autonomy and equality for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revealing what lies behind the familiar moniker of &quot;the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere,&quot; this indispensable book illuminates the foundations on which a new Haiti might yet emerge.&lt;/p&gt;" />
