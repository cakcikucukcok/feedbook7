  <title>Founding Friendship - Stuart Leibiger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Although the friendship between George Washington and James Madison was eclipsed
    in the early 1790s by the alliances of Madison with Jefferson and Washington with Hamilton,
    their collaboration remains central to the constitutional revolution that launched the American
    experiment in republican government. Washington relied heavily on Madison&#39;s advice, pen, and
    legislative skill, while Madison found Washington&#39;s prestige indispensable for achieving his
    goals for the new nation. Together, Stuart Leibiger argues, Washington and Madison struggled to
    conceptualize a political framework that would respond to the majority without violating
    minority rights. Stubbornly refusing to sacrifice either of these objectives, they cooperated in
    helping to build and implement a powerful, extremely republican
    constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observing Washington and Madison in light of their special
    relationship, Leibiger argues against a series of misconceptions about the two men. Madison
    emerges as neither a strong nationalist of the Hamiltonian variety nor a political
    consolidationist; he did not retreat from nationalism to states&#39; rights in the 1790s, as other
    historians have charged. Washington, far from being a majestic figurehead, exhibits a strong
    constitutional vision and firm control of his administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By examining
    closely Washington and Madison&#39;s correspondence and personal visits, Leibiger shows how a
    marriage of political convenience between two members of the Chesapeake elite grew into a
    genuine companionship fostered by historical events and a mutual interest in agriculture and
    science. The development of their friendship, and eventual estrangement, mirrors in fascinating
    ways the political development of the early Republic.&lt;/p&gt;" />
