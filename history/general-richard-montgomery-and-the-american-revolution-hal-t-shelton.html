  <title>General Richard Montgomery and the American Revolution - Hal T. Shelton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Brave, humane, and generous . . . still he was only a brave, humane, and generous rebel; curse on his virtues, they&#39;ve undone this country.&lt;br&gt;--Member of British Parliament Lord North, upon hearing of General Richard Montgomery&#39;s death in battle against the British&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At 3 a.m. on December 31, 1775, a band of desperate men stumbled through a raging Canadian blizzard toward Quebec.  The doggedness of this ragtag militia--consisting largely of men whose short-term enlistments were to expire within the next 24 hours--was due to the exhortations of their leader.  Arriving at Quebec before dawn, the troop stormed two unmanned barriers, only to be met by a British ambush at the third.  Amid a withering hale of cannon grapeshot, the patriot leader, at the forefront of the assault, crumpled to the ground.  General Richard Montgomery was dead at the age of 37.&lt;br&gt; Montgomery--who captured St. John and Montreal in the same fortnight in 1775; who, upon his death, was eulogized in British Parliament by Burke, Chatham, and Barr; and after whom 16 American counties have been named--has, to date, been a neglected hero.  Written in engaging, accessible prose, General Richard Montgomery and the American Revolution chronicles Montgomery&#39;s life and military career, definitively correcting this historical oversight once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
