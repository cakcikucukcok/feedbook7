  <title>Extreme Presidential Trivia - Bradley W. Rasch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From George Washington to Barack Obama, &lt;i&gt;Extreme Presidential Trivia&lt;/i&gt; offers an array of trivia and facts about the forty-four men who have been presidents of the United States of America. Researcher and author &lt;b&gt;Bradley W. Rasch&lt;/b&gt; presents a variety of lists, followed by fairly well-known trivia, and finally venturing into the obscure and little-known facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Extreme Presidential Trivia&lt;/i&gt; provides the answers to a host of questions surrounding the nations chief executive officers. You can learn which presidents died in office, served as attorneys before holding office, did not have children, were freemasons, attended Harvard, won the Nobel Peace Prize, or were Boy Scouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed to educate and entertain, &lt;i&gt;Extreme Presidential Trivia&lt;/i&gt; details trivia not found in many history books. Youll learn who was the only chief executive to be elected unanimously; who received a speeding ticket while in office, resulting in the confiscation of his horse and buggy; and who did play-by-play of a Chicago Cubs game on radio.&lt;/p&gt;" />
