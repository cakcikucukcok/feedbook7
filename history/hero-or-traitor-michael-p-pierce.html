  <title>Hero or Traitor? - Michael P Pierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What drives a man to become a rebel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a true story about a protestant man of English descent&lt;br /&gt;
who ends up becoming The Commander in Chief of The&lt;br /&gt;
United Irishmen in 1798.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rebellion of 1798 was one of the largest rebellions ever&lt;br /&gt;
in Irish history when Irishmen and women fought to gain&lt;br /&gt;
independence from England. It is estimated that over 30,000&lt;br /&gt;
people (on both sides) lost their lives in the rebellion that only&lt;br /&gt;
lasted about 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rebellion was carried out by The United Irishmen which&lt;br /&gt;
were the forerunners to other Irish organisations that&lt;br /&gt;
followed, for a period of over 100 years, in the pursuit of&lt;br /&gt;
independence from English rule. Independence was achieved&lt;br /&gt;
for 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland in 1921.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story is based on the memoirs of Joseph Holt (General&lt;br /&gt;
Holt). He tells the story mostly in his own words how he&lt;br /&gt;
ended up rebelling against the establishment that he used to&lt;br /&gt;
be a part of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some he was a hero, to others he was a traitor. You the&lt;br /&gt;
reader can decide for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;" />
