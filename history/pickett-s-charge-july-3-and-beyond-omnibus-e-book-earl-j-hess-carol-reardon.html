  <title>Pickett’s Charge, July 3 and Beyond, Omnibus E-book - Earl J. Hess, Carol Reardon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pickett&#39;s Charge, the assault on the Union lines on Cemetery Ridge ordered by Robert E. Lee on 3 July 1863, the last day of the Battle of Gettysburg, holds a central place in the nation&#39;s collective memory of the Civil War.  Available for the first time as an Omnibus E-book Edition, this two-volume set provides readers with an integrated view of the Charge, from the battlefield to the American imagination. The Omnibus comprises Earl J. Hess&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Pickett&#39;s Charge: The Last Attack at Gettysburg&lt;/i&gt;, a detailed and authoritative account of the Charge itself, and Carol Reardon&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Pickett&#39;s Charge in History and Memory&lt;/i&gt;, which provides the rest of the story: how, and why, Pickett&#39;s  Charge became so singularly important to our national memory of the Civil War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Pickett&#39;s Charge: The Last Attack at Gettysburg&lt;/i&gt;, Hess offers the definitive history of the most famous military action of the Civil War.

Over the years, soldiers, journalists, veterans, politicians, orators, artists, poets, and educators, Northerners and Southerners alike, shaped, revised, and even sacrificed the &#39;history&#39; of the charge to create &#39;memories&#39; that met ever-shifting needs and deeply felt values. Reardon shows that the story told today of Pickett&#39;s Charge is really an amalgam of history and memory. The evolution of that mix, she concludes, tells us much about how we come to understand our nation&#39;s past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
