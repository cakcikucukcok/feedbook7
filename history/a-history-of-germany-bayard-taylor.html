  <title>A History of Germany - Bayard Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Germans form one of the most important branches of the Indo-Germanic or Aryan race&amp;mdash;a division of the human family which also includes the Hindoos, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Celts, and the Slavonic tribes. The near relationship of all these, which have become so separated in their habits of life, forms of government and religious faith, in the course of many centuries, has been established by the evidence of common tradition, language, and physiological structure. The original home of the Aryan race appears to have been somewhere among the mountains and lofty table-lands of Central Asia. The word &amp;quot;Arya,&amp;quot; meaning&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;the high&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;the excellent&lt;/i&gt;, indicates their superiority over the neighboring races long before the beginning of history.&lt;br /&gt;
When and under what circumstances the Aryans left their home, can never be ascertained. Most scholars suppose that there were different migrations, and that each movement westward was accomplished slowly, centuries intervening between their departure from Central Asia and their permanent settlement in Europe. The earliest migration was probably that of the tribes who took possession of&amp;nbsp;Greece and Italy; who first acquired, and for more than a thousand years maintained, their ascendency over all other branches of their common family; who, in fact, laid the basis for the civilization of the world..." />
