  <title>Whispers of Rebellion - Michael L. Nicholls</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ambitious but abortive plan to revolt that ended in the conviction and
    hanging of over two dozen men, Gabriel’s Conspiracy of 1800 sought nothing less than to
    capture the capital city of Richmond and end slavery in Virginia. &lt;i&gt;Whispers of
    Rebellion&lt;/i&gt; draws on recent scholarship and extensive archival material to provide the
    clearest view yet of this fascinating chapter in the history of slavery—and to question much
    about the case that has been accepted as fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his examination of the slave
    Gabriel and his group of insurgents, Michael Nicholls focuses on the neighborhood of the Brook,
    north of Richmond, as the plot’s locus, revealing the area’s economic and familial
    ties, the geographic proximity of the key conspirators, and how their contacts allowed their
    plan to spread across three counties and into the cities of Richmond and Petersburg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nicholls explores underdocumented aspects of the conspiracy, such as the
    participants’ recruitment and motives, showing them to be less ideologically driven than
    previously supposed. The author also looks at the state’s swift and brutal response, and
    argues persuasively that, rather than the coalition between blacks and whites that has been
    described in other accounts, the participants were all slaves or free blacks, suffering under an
    oppressive white population and willing to die for their freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
