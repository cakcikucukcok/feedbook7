  <title>The making of Southeast Asia - Amitav Acharya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Developing a framework to study &quot;what makes a region,&quot; Amitav Acharya investigates the origins and evolution of Southeast Asian regionalism and international relations. He views the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) &quot;from the bottom up&quot;-as not only a U.S.-inspired ally in the Cold War struggle against communism but also an organization that reflects indigenous traditions. Although Acharya deploys the notion of &quot;imagined community&quot; to examine the changes, especially since the Cold War, in the significance of ASEAN dealings for a regional identity, he insists that &quot;imagination&quot; is itself not a neutral but rather a culturally variable concept. The regional imagination in Southeast Asia imagines a community of nations different from NAFTA or NATO, the OAU, or the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this new edition of a book first published as &lt;em&gt;The Quest for Identity&lt;/em&gt; in 2000, Acharya updates developments in the region through the first decade of the new century: the aftermath of the financial crisis of 1997, security affairs after September 2001, the long-term impact of the 2004 tsunami, and the substantial changes wrought by the rise of China as a regional and global actor. Acharya argues in this important book for the crucial importance of regionalism in a different part of the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
