  <title>Establishing Religious Freedom: Jefferson&#39;s Statute in Virginia - Thomas E. Buckley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The significance of the Virginia Statute for Establishing Religious     Freedom goes far beyond the borders of the Old Dominion. Its influence ultimately extended to     the Supreme Court&#39;s interpretation of the separation of church and state. In his latest     book, Thomas Buckley tells the story of the statute, beginning with its background in the     struggles of the colonial dissenters against an oppressive Church of England. When the     Revolution forced the issue of religious liberty, Thomas Jefferson drafted his statute and James     Madison guided its passage through the state legislature. Displacing an established church by     instituting religious freedom, the Virginia statute provided the most substantial guarantees of     religious liberty of any state in the new nation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The statute&#39;s     implementation, however, proved to be problematic. Faced with a mandate for strict separation of     church and state--and in an atmosphere of sweeping evangelical Christianity--Virginians clashed     over numerous issues, including the legal ownership of church property, the incorporation of     churches and religious groups, Sabbath observance, protection for religious groups, Bible     reading in school, and divorce laws. Such debates pitted churches against one another and     engaged Virginia&#39;s legal system for a century and a half.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fascinating     history in itself, the effort to implement Jefferson&#39;s statute has even broader     significance in its anticipation of the conflict that would occupy the whole country after the     Supreme Court nationalized the religion clause of the First Amendment in the     1940s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
