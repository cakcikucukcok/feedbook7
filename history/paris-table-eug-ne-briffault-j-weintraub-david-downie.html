  <title>Paris à Table - Eugène Briffault, J. Weintraub, David Downie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Described by &lt;em&gt;Le Monde&lt;/em&gt; as &quot;the richest view of Balzac&#39;s time seen from the table,&quot; &lt;em&gt;Paris &amp;#224; Table: 1846&lt;/em&gt; is an essential text in the history of gastronomy, along with Brillat-Savarin&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Physiology of Taste&lt;/em&gt; and Dumas&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Dictionary of Cuisine&lt;/em&gt;.
Its author, Eug&amp;#232;ne Briffault, was well-known in his day as a theater critic and chronicler of contemporary Paris, but also as a bon-vivant, celebrated for his ability to quaff a bell jar full of champagne in a single draft and well-qualified to write authoritatively about the culinary culture of Paris. Focusing on the manners and customs of the dining scene, Briffault takes readers from the opulence of a meal at the Rothschilds&#39; through every social stratum down to the student on the Left Bank and the laborer eating on the streets. He surveys the restaurants of the previous generation and his own--from the most elegant to the lowest dive--along with the eating habits of the bourgeoisie, the importance and variety of banquets, the institutional meal, and even the plight of &quot;people who do not dine,&quot; artists and intellectuals who fell on hungry times. He records the specialties, the d&amp;#233;cor, the patrons, and the restaurateurs and their waiters. A fine storyteller, Briffault collected culinary anecdotes, from the tantrums of a king deprived of his spinach to the tragedy of &quot;the friendliest pig that was ever seen.&quot; The volume includes the humorous drawings of the caricaturist Bertall that cleverly reinforce the witty and ironic tone of the text. Along with J. Weintraub&#39;s introduction--which provides the first modern biography of the author and analyzes the place of &lt;em&gt;Paris &amp;#224; Table&lt;/em&gt; in the literary culture of the time--the text is copiously annotated, acquainting readers with the events and characters that enliven the narrative.
&lt;em&gt;Paris &amp;#224; Table&lt;/em&gt; provides a delightful and delectable entryway to Briffault&#39;s Paris, the city Walter Benjamin characterized as &quot;the capital of the nineteenth century.&quot;" />
