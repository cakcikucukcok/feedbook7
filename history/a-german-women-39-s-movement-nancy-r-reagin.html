  <title>A German Women&#39;s Movement - Nancy R. Reagin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nancy Reagin analyzes the rhetoric, strategies, and programs of more than eighty bourgeois women&#39;s associations in Hanover, a large provincial capital, from the Imperial period to the Nazi seizure of power. She examines the social and demographic foundations of the Hanoverian women&#39;s movement, interweaving local history with developments on the national level. Using the German experience as a case study, Reagin explores the links between political conservatism and a feminist agenda based on a belief in innate gender differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reagin&#39;s analysis encompasses a wide variety of women&#39;s organizations--feminist, nationalist, religious, philanthropic, political, and professional. It focuses on the ways in which bourgeois women&#39;s class background and political socialization, and their support of the idea of &#39;spiritual motherhood,&#39; combined within an antidemocratic climate to produce a conservative, maternalist approach to women&#39;s issues and other political matters. According to Reagin, the fact that the women&#39;s movement evolved in this way helps to explain why so many middle-class women found National Socialism appealing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
