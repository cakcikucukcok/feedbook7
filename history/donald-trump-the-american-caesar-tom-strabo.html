  <title>Donald Trump: The American Caesar - Tom Strabo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is Donald Trump the American Caesar? There are many incredible parallels between the two men. The Roman establishment hated Julius Caesar and wanted him dead. They believed he would be a disaster for Rome, and bring chaos. They thought he was an obnoxious, overweening, preening narcissist and power-mad oligarch. He was denounced as a populist demagogue who would say anything to get into power.  Friends disowned him. Supporters became enemies. Numerous influential Romans spoke out against him and delivered chilling warnings if Caesar should assume power in Rome. Julius Caesar was a &quot;Strong Man&quot; who brought order to Rome in a time of weak leaders, an establishment that had lost its way, which no longer had any vision, and which was allowing chaos to reign on the streets. Before Caesar came to power, the glory that was Rome was fading fast. Its best days seemed behind it. The Republic was failing. Caesar set out to make Rome great again." />
