  <title>Ipswich - David Kindred</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David Kindred&#39;s book is a remarkable record of some 400 public houses, inns and beerhouses. The entries are organised into two sections: the first describes the public houses that have been closed since 1919 and includes photographs, while the second lists closures from the eighteenth century to the First World War punctuated with photographs where available. By consulting archives, borough records, period newspapers and the painstaking research of the late Jack Ruffles, David Kindred has successfully painted a picture of the evolution of the Ipswich public house. With interesting anecdotes from town residents and a section on the old coaching inns, the book is sure to make the reader see their cherished locals in a new light. David Kindred has worked in professional photography for 50 years, spending much of this time with the East Anglian Daily Times and Evening Star newspapers in Ipswich. This will be his seventh book with Old Pond Publishing." />
