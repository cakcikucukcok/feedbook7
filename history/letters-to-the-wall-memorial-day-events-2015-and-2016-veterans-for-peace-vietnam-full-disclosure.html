      <meta name="description" content="The letters included in this collection were written by people who were directly impacted by the American War in Vietnam -- combat veterans, nurses, loved ones of veterans, anti-war resistors, veterans&#39; family members, and fellow soldiers. For the past two Memorial Days they were delivered to The Wall in Washington, DC by members of Veterans For Peace as part of our Full Disclosure Project. We want their voices to be heard as our country embarks on a decade-long series of fifty year commemorations of that war. We will deliver letters to The Wall for the next ten years on Memorial Day.
