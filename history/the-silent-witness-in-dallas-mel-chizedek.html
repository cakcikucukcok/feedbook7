  <title>The Silent Witness In Dallas - Mel Chizedek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you served in Nam, you knew something was not quite right over there. If you ever looked into JFK&#39;s assassination, you knew there was a conspiracy. Why else would they tamper with witnesses, Evidence, and material facts? 
If you ever wanted to know the truth, this is the book to read. It is guaranteed to answer your questions and it is unlike any other book out there on the murder. Bar none!!!No goofy crap; just the shocking reality! 
Lee Harvey Oswald was completely innocent. They framed him. I should they, they tried to frame him. There&#39;s a new sheriff in town and he has a handful of warrants (starting with LBJ). 
This man is not out to make a buck peddling trash. He is a genius with a penchant for solving the unsolvable. Every lawyer should have this guy on their team. Every police station should have detectives this brilliant. What are you waiting for? It&#39;s cheap. And worth a thousand times more." />
