  <title>...But You Can&#39;t Enslave My Thinking... - Jaye Swift</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;I am an African American male who has had to deal with the racism and prejudice in this country, so the history that we were deprived of as children is where my expertise lies. There are hundreds of facts and events that are very important to the enrichment and growth of the black nation. We&#39;ve come very far without knowing our history; imagine, if we were grounded in our roots, how far we&#39;d be.
You can handcuff my wrists, you can shackle my feet, you can bind me in your chains, you can throw me in your deepest darkest dungeon ... but you can&#39;t enslave my thinking, for it is free like the wind.&lt;/i&gt;
Jaye Swift has sold over 40,000 CDs on the streets by himself. His music is the epitome of hip hop, and his name has been recognized by some of the greatest in music. His credibility in music is flawless, and he has refused to record with mindless artists who have no substance or integrity. It is only to his credit that &lt;i&gt;But You Can&#39;t Enslave My Thinking &lt;/i&gt; has been written with the same impeccable consistency and wisdom. It&#39;s designed to enlighten the minds of non-African Americans and enrich the lives of all African Americans." />
