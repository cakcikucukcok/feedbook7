  <title>Historical Dictionary of The Salvation Army - Major John G. Merritt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With more than 1,500,000 members and adherents in 109 countries, there is hardly anyone nowadays who is not familiar with the Salvation Army. And while many have been directly affected by its activities in health, relief, and community service, it is rare that one knows much about this unique Christian movement, which was founded in London in 1865 by William Booth_its first &#39;General&#39;_and has continued growing ever since. Whether merely curious, impressed by its work, or among its members, the Historical Dictionary of the Salvation Army provides a wealth of information for those who want to know more. This excellent source on all varieties of aspects related to the Salvation Army_its history, organization, structure, beliefs, and activities around the world_sums them all up in a broad introduction. It then presents the information in greater detail in hundreds of cross-referenced dictionary entries, while nearly a century-and-a-half of history is traced in the chronology, and further reading is indicated by two extensive bibliographies. This volume, written by more than 150 contributors_all specialists on different aspects and countries_under the direction of Major John G. Merritt, concludes with nine appendixes, including the first-ever published list of the more than 425 men and women who have attained the rank of Commissioner." />
