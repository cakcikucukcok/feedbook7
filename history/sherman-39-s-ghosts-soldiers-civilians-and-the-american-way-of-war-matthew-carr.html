Acclaimed journalist Matthew Carr then exposes how this strategy became the central preoccupation of war planners in the twentieth century and beyond, offering a stunning and lucid assessment of the impact Sherman&amp;#8217;s slash-and-burn policies have had on subsequent wars, including in the Philippines, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and even Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In riveting accounts of military campaigns and in the words and writings of American fighting men and military strategists, Carr finds ample and revealing evidence of Sherman&amp;#8217;s long shadow. &lt;I&gt;Sherman&amp;#8217;s Ghosts&lt;/I&gt; is a rare reframing of how we understand our violent history and a call to action for those who hope to change it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
