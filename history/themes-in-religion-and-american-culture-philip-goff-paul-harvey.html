  <title>Themes in Religion and American Culture - Philip Goff, Paul Harvey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Designed to serve as an introduction to American religion, this volume is distinctive in its approach: instead of following a traditional narrative, the book is arranged thematically. Eleven chapters by top scholars present, in carefully organized and accessible fashion, topics and perspectives fundamental to the understanding of religion in America. Some of the chapters treat aspects of faith typical to most religious groups, such as theology, proselytization, supernaturalism, and cosmology. Others deal with race, ethnicity, gender, the state, economy, science, diversity, and regionalism--facets of American culture that often interact with religion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each topical essay is structured chronologically, divided into sections on pre-colonial, colonial, revolutionary and early republican, antebellum, postbellum and late nineteenth-century, early twentieth-century, and modern America. One can study the extended history of a certain theme, or read &quot;across&quot; the book for a study of all the themes during a specific period in history. This book&#39;s new approach offers a rich analysis of the genuine complexity of American religious life. With a helpful glossary of basic religious terms, movements, people, and groups, this book will become an essential tool for students and teachers of religion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contributors:&lt;br/&gt;Yvonne Chireau, Swarthmore College&lt;br/&gt;Amy DeRogatis, Michigan State University&lt;br/&gt;William Durbin, Washington Theological Union&lt;br/&gt;Tracy Fessenden, Arizona State University&lt;br/&gt;James German, State University of New York, Potsdam&lt;br/&gt;Philip Goff, Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis&lt;br/&gt;Paul Harvey, University of Colorado, Colorado Springs&lt;br/&gt;Sue Marasco, Vanderbilt University &lt;br/&gt;Winnifred Fallers Sullivan, University of Chicago Divinity School&lt;br/&gt;Roberto Trevino, University of Texas, Arlington&lt;br/&gt;David Weaver-Zercher, Messiah College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;!--alternate first sentence for direct mail:&lt;br/&gt;Designed specifically to serve as a core text for an introduction to American religion, this volume is distinctive in its approach: instead of following a traditional narrative, the book is arranged thematically. &lt;br/&gt;--&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
