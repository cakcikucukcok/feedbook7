  <title>Jimmy Carter - Julian E. Zelizer, Jr. Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sean Wilentz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The maverick politician from Georgia who rode the post- Watergate wave into office but whose term was consumed by economic and international crises &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A peanut farmer from Georgia, Jimmy Carter rose to national power through mastering the strategy of the maverick politician. As the face of the &quot;New South,&quot; Carter&#39;s strongest support emanated from his ability to communicate directly to voters who were disaffected by corruption in politics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But running as an outsider was easier than governing as one, as Princeton historian Julian E. Zelizer shows in this examination of Carter&#39;s presidency. Once in power, Carter faced challenges sustaining a strong political coalition, as he focused on policies that often antagonized key Democrats, whose support he desperately needed. By 1980, Carter stood alone in the Oval Office as he confronted a battered economy, soaring oil prices, American hostages in Iran, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carter&#39;s unpopularity enabled Ronald Reagan to achieve a landslide victory, ushering in a conservative revolution. But during Carter&#39;s post-presidential career, he has emerged as an important voice for international diplomacy and negotiation, remaking his image as a statesman for our time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
