  <title>Fast Lane - Ralph Arnote</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Willy Hanson is a gentleman detective, an amateur Sam Spade who would love to solve a little riddle like the Maltese Falcon, but winds up doing matrimonial work.  When Amanda Granger, the pregnant wife of a philandering executive, asks Willy to get the dirt on her husband so that she can start a new life, he reluctantly takes the case.  But soon Willy finds that the man has been doing more than leading a double life.  With a sultry mistress by his side, Jason Granger seems poised to rocket his way to the top, not caring who he destroys along the way.  But a chance encounter with an enraged motorist has started a chain of events that he may not be able to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because his roadside opponent is a sociopath of sickening proportions.  And unless Willy puts all the pieces of the puzzle together in time, people will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
