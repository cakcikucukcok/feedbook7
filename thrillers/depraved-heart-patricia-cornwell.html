  <title>Depraved Heart - Patricia Cornwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Patricia Cornwell delivers the newest engrossing thriller in her high-stakes series starring medical examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depraved Heart: &amp;#8220;Void of social duty and fatally bent on mischief.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8212;Mayes v. People, 806 III. 306 (1883)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kay Scarpetta is working a suspicious death scene in Cambridge, Massachusetts when an emergency alert sounds on her phone. A video link lands in her text messages and seems to be from her computer genius niece Lucy. But how can it be? It&amp;#8217;s clearly a surveillance film of Lucy taken almost twenty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Scarpetta watches she begins to learn frightening secrets about her niece, whom she has loved and raised like a daughter. That film clip and then others sent soon after raise dangerous legal implications that increasingly isolate Scarpetta and leave her confused, worried, and not knowing where to turn. She doesn&amp;#8217;t know whom she can tell&amp;#8212;not her FBI husband Benton Wesley or her investigative partner Pete Marino. Not even Lucy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new novel, Cornwell launches these unforgettable characters on an intensely psychological odyssey that includes the mysterious death of a Hollywood mogul&amp;#8217;s daughter, aircraft wreckage on the bottom of the sea in the Bermuda Triangle, a grisly gift left in the back of a crime scene truck, and videos from the past that threaten to destroy Scarpetta&amp;#8217;s entire world and everyone she loves. The diabolical presence behind what unfolds seems obvious&amp;#8212;but strangely, not to the FBI. Certainly that&amp;#8217;s the message they send when they raid Lucy&amp;#8217;s estate and begin building a case that could send her to prison for the rest of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest novel in her bestselling series featuring chief medical examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Cornwell will captivate readers with the shocking twists, high-wire tension, and cutting-edge forensic detail that she is famous for, proving yet again why she&amp;#8217;s the world&amp;#8217;s #1 bestselling crime writer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
