  <title>Sworn to Secrecy - Dirty Handsome</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is the mid-eighties and the crack epidemic is ravishing impoverished neighborhoods infested with ruffians, exotic dancers, and young men desperate to make money. Rahiem, the son of a heroin-addicted mother and a father who abandoned him a decade ago, is an honor student who is exposed to hustlers every day. One of the hustlers is Amion who has ties to a drug kingpin. Eventually, outside influences catch up with Rahiem and he begins getting into trouble.
After Rahiems father is released from prison, he becomes determined to unite his family. Although he does his best to keep Rahiem away from bad influences, he soon realizes his son is indulging in criminal activity. As an overzealous detective spearheads an investigation into a sophisticated criminal syndicate, a murderer is unleashed. After Amion is arrested on several charges, his lavish lifestyle abruptly ends and prompts Rahiem to bow out of the criminal life. But just as he begins creating a brighter future, his father hands him a tempting proposition with the power to change everything.
In this urban thriller, a young man who succumbs to the lures of the streets is led down a dark path where nothing is certain and everything and everyone is at risk." />
