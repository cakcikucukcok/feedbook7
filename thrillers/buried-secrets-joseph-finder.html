  <title>Buried Secrets - Joseph Finder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Joseph Finder introduced Nick Heller, a &quot;private spy&quot; who finds out things powerful people want to keep hidden, to widespread acclaim from the critics and wild enthusiasm from the readers, in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling novel &lt;i&gt;Vanished&lt;/i&gt;. Now, in &lt;i&gt;Buried Secrets&lt;/i&gt;, Nick Heller returns, finding himself in the middle of a life-or-death situation that&#39;s both high-profile and intensely personal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick has returned to his old home town of Boston to set up his own shop. There he&#39;s urgently summoned by an old family friend. Hedge fund titan Marshall Marcus desperately needs Nick&#39;s help. His teenaged daughter, Alexa, has just been kidnapped. Her abduction was clearly a sophisticated professional job, done with extraordinary precision. Alexa, whom Nick has known since she was young, is now buried alive, held prisoner in an underground crypt, a camera trained on her, her suffering streaming live over the internet. She&#39;s been left with a limited supply of food and water and, if her father doesn&#39;t meet the demands of her shadowy kidnappers, she&#39;ll die. And as Nick begins to probe, he discovers that all is not quite right with Marshall Marcus&#39;s business. He&#39;s being investigated by the FBI, he has a lot of shady investors, his fund is in danger and now he has a lot of powerful enemies who may have the motivation to go after Marcus&#39;s daughter. But to find out who&#39;s holding Alexa Marcus hostage, Nick has to find out why. Once he does, he uncovers an astonishing conspiracy that reaches far beyond anything he could have imagined. And if he&#39;s going to find Alexa in time, he will have to flush out and confront some of his deadliest opponents ever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
