          &lt;strong&gt;Would She Stand By Her Man…or Suspect him of Murder?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ever since J. D. Garrison had broken her adolescent heart when he&#39;d skipped town years ago, the radio and the supermarket tabloids had been Denver McCallahan&#39;s only link to the man who&#39;d become country music&#39;s &quot;brightest star.&quot; That is, until her uncle Max got murdered….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Suddenly J.D. was waltzing back into her life…sweeping her off her feet and warning her not to trust his best friend, Pete, the one man who&#39;d helped dry her teenage tears.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The two men Denver loved most were now accusing each other of murder! One had stood by her…the other had broken her heart. Would Denver choose the right man?&lt;/p&gt;
