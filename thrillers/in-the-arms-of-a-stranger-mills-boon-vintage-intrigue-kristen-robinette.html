  <title>In The Arms Of A Stranger (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - Kristen Robinette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The scene was one she&#39;d long fantasized but fate had denied: a strong, handsome man protecting her, a gurgling baby gazing adoringly at her. Yet, snowbound with police chief Luke Sutherlin and a rescued infant, Dana Langston had never felt so alone. For she knew this precious taste of family was as fleeting as the melting snow…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;and as fragile as the life a killer sought to extinguish.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then she and Luke became lovers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She would have settled for passion-filled memories, yet, despite the danger, Dana found herself imagining a future with her beloved lawman. But that was before the mystery baby&#39;s identity was revealed, and she became Luke&#39;s prime suspect–for murder.&lt;/p&gt;
