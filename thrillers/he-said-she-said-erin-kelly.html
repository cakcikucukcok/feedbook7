  <title>He Said/She Said - Erin Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A tour de force - a gripping, twisting, furiously clever read that asks all the right questions, and keeps you guessing until the very end. I loved it.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Ruth Ware&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Haunting. Mesmerizing. Unforgettable.&quot; -- Gillian Flynn&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the summer of 1999, Kit and Laura travel to a festival in Cornwall to see a total eclipse of the sun. Kit is an eclipse chaser; Laura has never seen one before. Young and in love, they are certain this will be the first of many they&#39;ll share. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But in the hushed moments after the shadow passes, Laura interrupts a man and a woman. She knows that she saw something terrible. The man denies it. It is her word against his. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The victim seems grateful. Months later, she turns up on their doorstep like a lonely stray. But as her gratitude takes a twisted turn, Laura begins to wonder--did she trust the wrong person? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 15 years later, Kit and Laura married are living under new names and completely off the digital grid: no Facebook, only rudimentary cell phones, not in any directories. But as the truth catches up to them, they realize they can no longer keep the past in the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; From Erin Kelly, queen of the killer twist, &lt;i&gt;He Said/She Said&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping tale of the lies we tell to save ourselves, the truths we cannot admit, and how far we will go to make others believe our side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
