  <title>To Love and Die in Dallas - Mary Elizabeth Goldman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rich in both &quot;rowdy&quot; and big city sophistication, Dallas is a city of paradox. It&#39;s a city with attitude where men don&#39;t walk, they &quot;stride,&quot; women with &quot;big hair&quot; speak with a distinct drawl because they want to. It&#39;s a city that has experienced, endured, thrived, and even capitalized on the reputation and scars of assassinations, protests, and murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;To Love and Die in Dallas&lt;/i&gt; unfolds through the pages of  ill-gotten diary that recalls the teenage years of four best friends. It recalls a time of innocence when Dallas teenagers were bopping at sock-hops to the tunes of Buddy Holly and Jerry Lee Lewis, cruising around White Rock Lake, and hanging out at the drive-in on Garland Road. But time changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is now the twenty-first century and those carefree teenagers are the power players in Dallas. The murder of one of the friends, Lindsay &quot;Rose&quot; Mitchell, the wife of US Senator James &quot;Buddy&quot; Mitchell turns Dallas high society upside down. Her funeral brings the three best friends back together again, where they vow to find out what really happened. But some stones are better left unturned. Each one of them has deep secrets and they soon realize that anyone of them could be a suspect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
