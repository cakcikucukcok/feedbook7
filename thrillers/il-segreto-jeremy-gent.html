  <title>Il Segreto - Jeremy Gent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, il segreto (the secret) is the follow on from il complotto (the plot) and is followed by la fuga (the escape).
It tells the story Maddelena Ongaro, daughter of Luisa whose sister Gianna was murdered before Maddelena was born.  Maddelena grows up in Venice with her brother Cesare.  A traumatic event occurs which remains her secret.  She eventually marries and emigates to Australia with her husband David Court.  She visits Italy once per year but after the death of her father gets caught up in trying to shield her mother from the part she played in the murderous plot carried out by her brother-in-law Paul.
When Paul dies information turns up that reveals the possible identity of Gianna&#39;s killer after more than thirty years.  A trial follows and at last someone is convicted.  But has the correct person gone to prison?" />
