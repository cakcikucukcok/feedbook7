  <title>Descent into Madness - David Burford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Reginald J. Smythe discovered an old, handwritten journal at the bottom of a steamer trunk purchased at an estate sale in Atlanta, Georgia, he knew there was a story to be told. In his hand, he held the personal thoughts of Willfred Medford McCallister III, a notorious serial killer. Smythe researched McCallisters life and journeyed into his heart, mind, and soulfrom his humble beginnings to his bitter end. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;According to McCallister, he led a fairly normal and most unremarkable life. Born in 1929 in Brufford, Texas, he was the only child of Willfred and Shirley. He grew up, served in the military, worked at various jobs, paid his taxes, and bowled with his buddies. But all that changed one dark night in November of 1984 when he ran into Albert DeMoss. Then McCallisters descent into the dark of humanity began. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Smythe narrates a heart-wrenching tale of violence and cruelty, a story of one mans journey to becoming a serial killera man who murdered more than forty people.&lt;/p&gt;" />
