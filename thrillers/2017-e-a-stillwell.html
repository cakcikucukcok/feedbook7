  <title>2017 - E. A. Stillwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 2010 as Congresswoman Barbara Pellegrino and her chief of staff enjoy another passionate tryst together in what they believe is a secure love nest. But what they do not know is that Michael Middleton and Harry Reason, friends of the newly elected rogue president, are in the midst of conducting electronic surveillance that they hope will destroy Barbaras political dreams and eventually make Reasons single daughter, Candy, the first female president instead. But first, Candy must be appointed as the presidents national security adviserand find a suitable mate.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the president agrees to play cupid for Candy and Princeton professor Brad Jenkins, a nongovernmental entity to fight terrorism is formed. When two women working for Middleton accidentally enter the back door of a terrorist website, he seeks help from Jenkins, a Middle East expert. When their collaboration leads to the discovery of a secret plot to make Pellegrino the president and a vast conspiracy by five billionaires to radically transform the country, Middleton and Jenkins reluctantly join forces to stop the dark mission. Now the unthinkable must be performed without the American public ever knowingand it must be completed in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;2017&lt;/i&gt; shares a tale of political intrigue as conspiracies swirl around several leaders determined to save their country from upheaval.&lt;/p&gt;" />
