  <title>Gene Defense - Joy Ashe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This fast-paced genetic thriller with a strong political undertow begins with a
phone call plea for help to Boston-based attorney Paeton Weaver by her sister,
Casey Bell, after the discovery of her philanthropist husbands bloodied body,
supposedly, by his own hand. Local Florida authorities are suspicious about the
circumstances of Leonard L. Bells death. His death comes in the year 2013,
post the U.S. presidential inauguration. Paeton Weaver takes the reader on a
disturbing journey to examine the social, psychological and legal ramifi cations
of genetic social engineering when under new US leadership, citizens become
valued based on genetic characteristics. Paeton discovers a dark Weaver family
history through a series of nightmares. Secrets kept hidden over two hundred
years reveal ghastly murders. She ponders her own genetic fate. In 2013, the
American way of life, from our health care provisions, justice system, medical
outcomes, jobs, friends, family, water, food supply and our very own fate,
depends upon our DNA. No one can hide from their genetic history. What
defense do we have against our genes?" />
