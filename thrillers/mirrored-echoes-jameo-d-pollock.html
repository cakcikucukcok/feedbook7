  <title>Mirrored Echoes - Jameo D. Pollock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Myrna Sontiago and Zeke LaPorte have never had trouble solving murder cases. In fact, the duo solves most of them quickly. But they have never had a case like this one.
The Dallas Homicide Squads rising star detectives face a string of unique, disturbing murders. Making matters worse, the bodies are publicly displayed. For months, they have been plagued by the lack of a connection to the randomness and unpredictability of the killer.
Faced with increasing pressure from city officials, public fear, a rising body count, and faltering confidence, the detectives are at their wits end. The city looks to them for answers, but they have none to give. 
Their desperation to catch the killer escalates when one of the murders personally impacts the department.  The impatient, quick-thinking Myrna and the rational, cerebral Zeke have to see the unseen to discover the connection, or the frenzy will continue." />
