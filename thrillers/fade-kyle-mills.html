A secret wing of Homeland Security is recruiting agents to work undercover in the Middle East, and the director wants his second-in-command, Matt Egan, to bring aboard an old friend, Salam Al Fayed--better known as Fade. He&#39;s perfect: An ex-Navy Seal and the son of immigrants, he speaks flawless Arabic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trouble is, he&#39;s &quot;retired&quot;; he was wounded in the line of duty, and the government refused to pay for the risky surgery that could have helped him. Now he&#39;s walking around with a bullet lodged near his spine, and he&#39;s not too fond of anyone in the government -- least of all, his ex-best friend Matt Egan, whom he blames for his present condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against Egan&#39;s wishes, the director tries to &quot;persuade&quot; Fade to join the team. But Fade is prepared to fight back at any cost. The chase is on -- will Matt be able to find his friend-turned-fugitive before Fade can take the ultimate revenge? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fade&lt;/i&gt; is a remarkable, take-no-prisoners program from an unparalleled writer at the height of his talents.&lt;/p&gt;" />
