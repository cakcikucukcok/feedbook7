  <title>September Woods - Linda Florke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An extremely dangerous prisoner stumbles across a secret that could leave him financially set for life. He escapes from a maximum security prison and flees across state lines leaving a trail of destruction in his path. He seeks obscurity in the Northern wooded area of Wisconsin, and while shrouded in the deep forested area stumbles across 15-year-old Stella Compton, whom he abducts and holds prisoner. Stella finds herself in the midst of an incomprehensible nightmare, and one she fears there is no escape from. She vows if she survives her nightmarish ordeal and is reunited with her loved ones, she will commit her life to righting the wrongs the only way she knows how. Surprisingly, her journey leads her to the one man who restores faith in her future, and who will ultimately become the center of her world. This is a story that speaks volumes about the importance of our human relationships and the animals we bond with, and how one girl achieves triumph over tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
