  <title>The Hike - Gwendolyn Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Five women set off into the Willamette National Forest in the Oregon Cascades, primed for a hiking trip filled with relaxation and breathtaking scenery. Lexi Reynolds, a happily married real estate mogul in the mood to celebrate, heads the show. With Lexi is her sister, Leni, from New York; her secretary, Susie, whos about to get married; a friend, Sally, who hopes to clear her head in the mountain air; and Carol Lyn, who doesnt want to be there at all.
Lexi has no idea that earlier in the week her husband hired someone to kill her. In a dark bar, Bart Reynolds made a plan with the odious Freddie The Ferret Feretsky. Bart wants his wife dead by the time hes back from an innocent trip to Vegas, but he pays the Ferret to knock off Lexino one else. Bart has no idea that hes hired a monster that will stop at nothing to fulfill a constant lust for human blood.
What began as a peaceful romp through the quiet wilderness is about to turn into a fight to survive for five women who never saw it coming. The Ferret is on their trail, but he may have gotten in over his head. If they survive, this hike may take them all into the mouth of madness." />
