      <meta name="description" content="In Book 1 of the Twenty-Seven series fifty-six-year-old Gilbert Morgan has treasure hunting in his blood.  While on a dive to find a sunken ship, Morgan is nearly out of oxygen when he accidentally cuts his hand on a throny plant.  While he sleeps, his body reverts back to that of a twenty-seven year old.
After his diving crew stares at him in disbelief the next morning, a now much younger-looking Morgan quickly determines the source of his youthfulness and excavates the plant.  While Morgan attemps to understand how to replicate the proccess and subsequently commercialize it, billionare William S. Bates, who has learned of the aquatic plants amazing powers, launches a fast-paced chase to steal the amazing plant from its rightful owner. 
Join Morgan and his crew through the wild ride that ensues with such an invaluble treasure hunt find. 
What a fun book! I love a book that surprises and intrigues me and this one certainly did.  I never knew what was coming next and it made me think about the what ifs in life.  I also very much enjoyed getting to know the characters and their personalities, I felt like I really got to know them." />
