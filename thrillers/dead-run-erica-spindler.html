  <title>Dead Run - Erica Spindler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m in trouble, Liz. I&amp;#39;ve uncovered something.&amp;#133; They&amp;#39;re watching.&amp;#133;&amp;#34;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That panicked message on her answering machine is the last time Liz Ames hears from her sister Rachel, pastor of Paradise Christian Church in Key West, Florida.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compelled to uncover the truth about her sister&amp;#39;s disappearance, she heads to Key West. Within hours of her arrival a successful banker jumps to his death. Then a teenage girl whom Rachel was counseling is found brutally murdered. The ritualistic style of the killing is hauntingly similar to that used by the notorious &amp;#34;New Testament&amp;#34; serial killer&amp;#151;now on death row.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Could the teen&amp;#39;s murder be related to Rachel&amp;#39;s disappearance? Is a copycat killer at work? And why do the police refuse to help?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For answers, Liz turns to Rick Wells, a former Miami cop who worked the fringes of the &amp;#34;New Testament&amp;#34; investigation. Together they peel away layers of deception to reveal a terrifying adversary&amp;#151;and the unspeakable evil at the heart of this island paradise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
