  <title>The Airplane - Karl Milde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Never one to color inside the lines, the brilliant inventor Carl Collingwood is positive that his new aircraft will trigger waves of influence worldwide, changing the course of aeronautics forever. Investigative journalist Juli Gables is granted exclusive rights to cover the first flight of Collingwoods groundbreaking aircraft. But when the plane inexplicably crashes and kills its creator, Gables finds herself witness, and reporter, to a tragic story. 
Using her investigative skills and sharp observations, Gables resolves to unearth the cause of the crash for the sake of Collingwoods widow. She learns that it was not a mechanical malfunction that killed Collingwood; someone wanted him dead. With her newfound knowledge, Gables may be in danger, tooespecially when this investigation leads her all the way to the White House.
As she attempts to get closer to the truth, Gables is dogged at every step by disruptive parties, including the police and fellow reporters. As her investigation continues, she uncovers a plot to assassinate the President of the United States when he is scheduled to give a speech at the United States Military Academy at West Point. When authorities do not listen to her as she voices her claims, it seems as if Gables will have to take matters into her own hands in order to prevent imminent tragedy." />
