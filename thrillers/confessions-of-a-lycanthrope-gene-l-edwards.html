  <title>Confessions of a Lycanthrope - Gene L. Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    Unable to cope with the tragedies in his life, including the loss of his young daughter, Caleb escapes from his overwhelming misery by retreating to a
    remote part of Alaska to work. While there, he and a friend are savagely attacked late at night by what Caleb initially believes to be a bear. Soon enough,
    Caleb realizes that life as he knew it has abruptly come to its end.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    After a rushed and cruel orientation to a tormented and lonely world that he is now a part of, Caleb reenters society only to learn that he is ill-prepared
    to exist as a part of it. We follow Caleb as he encounters other werewolves and attempts to balance his fading humanity against an increasingly monstrous
    part of his nature. Along the way, he crosses paths with those who are driven through malicious intent, as well as those who are as hopelessly lost as he
    is through their journey.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    We find in Caleb, a man running from his past and haunted by the demon that resides within him. In the end, Caleb must face the inescapable result of his
    own ironic tragedy.
