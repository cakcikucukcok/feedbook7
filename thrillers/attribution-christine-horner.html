When WREN is compromised during an opening ceremony live broadcast, the world is suddenly plunged into a global state of emergency.&lt;br /&gt; Questioning the authenticity of media reports, Goodman risks revealing her true identity as she races to expose the greatest coup ever attempted. Confronting the impossible in search of redemption, one journalist will dare to rewrite human history&amp;mdash;centuries in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horner writes with unapologetic clarity as she dares you to explore the fluidity of identity, truth, and the resilience of the human mind, body, and spirit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
