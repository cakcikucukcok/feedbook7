  <title>Moskva - Jack Grimwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Red Square, 1985. The naked body of a young man is left outside the walls of the Kremlin, frozen solid--like marble to the touch--missing the little finger from his right hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A week later, Alex Marston, the headstrong fifteen-year-old daughter of the British Ambassador, disappears. Army Intelligence Officer Tom Fox, posted to Moscow to keep him from telling the truth to a government committee, is asked to help find her. It&#39;s a shot at redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Russia is reluctant to give up the worst of her secrets. As Fox&#39;s investigation sees him dragged deeper towards the dark heart of a Soviet establishment determined to protect its own, his fears for Alex&#39;s safety grow with those of the girl&#39;s father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if Fox can&#39;t find her soon, she looks likely to become the next victim of a sadistic killer whose story is bound tight to that of his country&#39;s terrible past...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Moskva &lt;/i&gt;is a brilliantly written, chilling and sophisticated the first serial killer thriller by two-time BSFA winner Jon Courtenay Grimwood.&lt;/p&gt;" />
