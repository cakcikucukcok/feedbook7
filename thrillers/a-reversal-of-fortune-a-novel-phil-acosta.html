  <title>A Reversal of Fortune: a Novel - Phil Acosta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Based on a true story, A REVERSAL OF FORTUNE depicts the struggle of a successful, level-headed lawyer and his new free-spirited, unpredictable wife in adjusting to their recent marriage, coping with their law firm, facing the economic hardships of the current recession, and eventually losing everything. In his clear, conversational style, the author begins his story where his debut novel, THREE WEEKS IN ITALY, ended. Although reading his first novel is entirely unnecessary to understand his recent work, the author continues the story of Doug and Gianna Steele after their tumultuous honeymoon in Italy. Returning home to an affluent lifestyle, Gianna decides to join Doug&#39;s law firm and eventually experiences a betrayal that leads to disastrous events. The reader will follow the main characters as they desperately attempt to survive through the morass of evictions, sub-prime borrowing, foreclosures, unemployment, bad credit, law suits, and despair. After the devastation, Gianna moves back into her mother&#39;s home and Doug ends up in a trailer park. Stripped of their material possessions, they soon discover a hidden treasure in their relationship which leads them to redemption and a new life together." />
