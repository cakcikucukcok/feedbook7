  <title>A Perfect Stranger (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) - Jenna Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;P.I. Damon Marlowe always found his man–or, in this case, his woman.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tracking down Darcy Nolan at his client&#39;s request was a piece of cake for the ex-cop. But there was something about this assignment that didn&#39;t sit right with him. When the attractive blonde was attacked, put into danger by his unwitting exposure, Marlowe told himself he had no choice but to flush out her would-be killer. After all, he had compromised the cover of a protected witness to a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But was it the guilt that drove him…or a deeper emotion he&#39;d long since buried? Try as he might, Darcy roused feelings he&#39;d rather deny. But for Marlowe, the motive didn&#39;t matter. The killer was making his move, and now Darcy was his to protect….&lt;/p&gt;
