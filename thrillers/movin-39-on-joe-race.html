  <title>Movin&#39; On - Joe Race</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Sheriff&#39;s Sergeant Tom Parker has to get out of Los Angeles before he gets hurt on the job, or goes over the edge emotionally. He is approaching middle age, wondering if there isn&#39;t more to life than nightshifts, and is tired of ducking bullets and breaking up fights in gang territory. He wins millions of dollars gambling in Las Vegas and makes his way to the sun, surf and sand of Saipan in Micronesia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tom buys an old dilapidated hotel, starts a Private Investigations agency, and is soon involved with a myriad of characters, some hilarious and others deadly, from Asia and the mainland. With his divorce final, he enjoys a series of ladies, but unexpectedly falls in love with his hotel manager, Cocina, a Filipina with three children. He and his Private Eye partner, Carlos, come in conflict with local officials and hoodlums, and soon the shooting starts. Tom vowed that he would never re-marry, or get back into police work, but he breaks both these resolutions after several months on the island. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even with the dark days of grief and hardship after several shootings, Tom never despairs. He is where he wants to be, enjoys the sunsets, windsurfing, making new friends, playing ukulele music, and drinking lo-calorie pina coladas... and finding new love.
