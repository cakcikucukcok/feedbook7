After he broke with the Orphan Program, Evan disappeared and reinvented himself as the Nowhere Man, a man spoken about only in whispers and dedicated to helping the truly desperate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this time, the voice on the other end is Jack Johns, the man who raised and trained him, the only father Evan has ever known.
