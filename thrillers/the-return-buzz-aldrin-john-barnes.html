His pilot program has been marred by a fatal accident, he&#39;s out of a job, and he&#39;s being sued for a billions dollars. And it&#39;s beginning to seem that the &quot;accident&quot; wasn&#39;t at all accidental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the endless conflict between India and Pakistan heats up...and Pakistan explodes a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere, frying electronics on earth and in space, and putting the crew of the international Space Station at risk.
