  <title>Victims&#39; Choice - Michael McClister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Victim&#39;s Choice&lt;/i&gt;, the spectacular first novel by Michael McClister, Joe Colby is a successful TV newscaster and a recent widower. When he loses his two children to a rapist-murderer, there is little that can be done to assuage his crippling grief--even when the man is caught and put behind bars. With an unquenchable thirst for revenge, Joe develops a crazy scheme to get at him in prison. But the cops, particularly one he knows well, make him see reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there begins in the city a series of murders of people close to convicted killers. A double homicide takes the lives of the wives of the lawyer who defended several of the criminals and the judge whose sentences were thought too lenient. A citywide panic begins as others receive threats and there are more murders. A famous crime fighter is soon enlisted to try and find the person who calls himself &quot;The Avenger&quot;. The tension mounts until the climactic and utterly surprising ending.&lt;/p&gt;" />
