  <title>Red Swan - P. T. Deutermann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Written with the authority of twenty-six years of military and government service at sea and in Washington, &lt;i&gt;Red Swan&lt;/i&gt; is a brilliant, provocative thriller about the contemporary war that no one sees, but which will shape the future of America and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set in contemporary Washington D.C., &lt;i&gt;Red Swan &lt;/i&gt;begins with an ominous phone call from Carson McGill, the Deputy Director of Operations in the CIA, to retired CIA officer Preston Allender. Henry Wallace is dead. A behind-the-scenes operator at the CIA, Wallace was integral to the Agency&#39;s secret war against China&#39;s national intelligence service, which infiltrates government and military offices, major businesses, and systems crucial to our security. Wallace had severely damaged China&#39;s Washington spy ring with a devastating ruse, a so-called &quot;black swan,&quot; in which a deep-undercover female agent targeted and destroyed a key Chinese official. Now, Wallace&#39;s mysterious death suggests that the CIA itself has been compromised and that China has someone inside the Agency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Allender quietly investigates, he makes a shocking discovery that will upend the entire American intelligence apparatus. For Wallace&#39;s black swan operation may have been turned against the CIA; a red swan is flying and the question is: who is she, what is her target, and where will she land?&lt;/p&gt;" />
