  <title>The Crossroads - Mark Hostutler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;The Crossroads: A Short-Story Collection&lt;/I&gt; is an assembly of seven unrelated tales of contemporary fiction seamlessly linked by two common denominators: themes extracted from normal, everyday occurrences and settings in the city of Philadelphia and its surrounding areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet a financial advisor who, while choosing to remain anonymous, confesses the crime he and his three college roommates committed ten years before as a result of their gambling vices and a subsequent trip to Atlantic City gone awry What happens when a young woman&#39;s disenchantment with the monotony of her nine-to-five job has become too much to bear? Settle down in your front-row seat at the scene of a deathbed where the twenty-one-year-old child of a family struggles to cope with his father&#39;s imminent passing And read the journal of a man offering his wisdom as he serves more than a life sentence in a prison like no other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his witty and provocative debut book, experience the author&#39;s exceptional ability to dissect ordinary situations and unearth the extraordinary elements that lie within. Join him as he explores those prevalent, yet unforeseen moments of truth that we all encounter. Through a voice that&#39;s one of a kind, the stylish language of this brand of fiction, undoubtedly, speaks to people of all ages and is bound to keep you turning the pages!&lt;/p&gt;" />
