  <title>Obsessed - G. H. Ephron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;G. H. Ephron&#39;s gripping crime novels deal with fascinating psychological symptoms at work in the minds of murderers and their targets. In &lt;i&gt;Obsessed&lt;/i&gt;, forensic neuropsychologist and expert defense witness Peter Zak is trying to help a coworker, Dr. Emily Ryan, who is being tormented by a stalker. She doesn&#39;t have any idea who it could be, and his acts have been escalating, to the point where he&#39;s breaking into her car and leaving sick messages. Peter is increasingly worried about where the violence will end. And there is no lack of suspects, as the naive Emily seems to attract admirers blindly; from her colleagues at the Neuropsychiatric Unit where she is studying the brain and its disorders to the other doctors at the Pearce Psychiatric Institute, even Peter notices himself responding to her blond good looks and puppy dog eyes. Or, as suggested by Peter&#39;s friend p.i. Annie Squires, is Emily more aware of her appeal than she lets on?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When one of the potential suspects turns up dead, what started as a nuisance is suddenly much more complicated, and dangerous. Once again, G. H. Ephron delivers a complex, absorbing case that turns upon Peter&#39;s expert knowledge of human nature.&lt;/p&gt;" />
