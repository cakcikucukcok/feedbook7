  <title>The Sacrament - Olaf Olafsson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The haunting, vivid story of a nun whose past returns to her in unexpected ways, all while investigating a mysterious death and a series of harrowing abuse claims&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A young nun is sent by the Vatican to investigate allegations of misconduct at a Catholic school in Iceland. During her time there, on a gray winter&amp;#8217;s day, a young student at the school watches the school&amp;#8217;s headmaster, Father August Franz, fall to his death from the church tower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two decades later, the child&amp;#8212;now a grown man, haunted by the past&amp;#8212;calls the nun back to the scene of the crime. Seeking peace and calm in her twilight years at a convent in France, she has no choice to make a trip to Iceland again, a trip that brings her former visit, as well as her years as a young woman in Paris, powerfully and sometimes painfully to life.&amp;#160;In Paris,&amp;#160;she met an Icelandic girl who she has not seen since, but whose acquaintance changed her life, a relationship she relives all while reckoning with the mystery of August Franz&amp;#8217;s death and the abuses of power that may have brought it on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Sacrament&lt;/em&gt;, critically acclaimed novelist Olaf Olafsson looks deeply at the complexity of our past lives and selves; the faulty nature of memory; and the indelible mark left by the joys and traumas of youth. Affecting and beautifully observed,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Sacrament&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;is both propulsively told and poignantly written&amp;#8212;tinged with the tragedy of life&amp;#8217;s regrets but also moved by the possibilities of redemption, a new work from a novelist who consistently surprises and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;" />
