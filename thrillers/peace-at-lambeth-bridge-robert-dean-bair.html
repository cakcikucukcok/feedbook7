  <title>Peace at Lambeth Bridge - Robert Dean Bair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After fulfilling a confidential mission for President Harry Truman in 1948, Rob Royal accepts an invitation to join a covert group of private citizens advocating patriotism and other beliefs upon which America was founded. The group successfully operates outside of the government and military intelligence community. He enjoys his work, and now, as a devoted undercover agent, Royal works steadfastly to provide confidential information to top government officials, including the president of the United States.&lt;p&gt; 
After being subpoenaed to testify at a trial concerning one project, despite high security, United States marshals escort him up the steps of the federal building in Newark, New Jersey, where someone tries to kill him. Surviving, Royal continues to live a double life, keeping his work a secret while living what appears to be an ordinary life.&lt;p&gt; 
When Royal anonymously receives a newspaper article announcing an arrest concerning one of his projects, members of the covert group suspect that Royals cover has been blown. As his enemies begin to close in on him, Royal knows that his greatest challenges lie before him. 
How will he be able to survive the life-threatening scenarios that greet him?" />
