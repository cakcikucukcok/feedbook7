  <title>The Teeth of the Tiger - Maurice Leblanc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In &amp;quot;The Teeth of the Tiger&amp;quot;, Maurice Leblanc delivers another Arsene Lupin adventure set in World War I. Arsene Lupin is the French counterpart to the English Sherlock Holmes, a sincere hero who has failings, which ender him to the reader. This romance and adventure/thriller is by far the best of the Lupin series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Teeth of the Tiger&amp;quot; tells the story of the final Will of a man named Mornington, who, in the year 1900, left behind the sum of $400 million francs. Of that, three-fourths went to his adopted country - which left $100 million francs to be distributed to his heirs. The executor of the estate was Mornington&amp;#39;s friend, Don Luis Perenna (AKA Arsene Lupin). The problem, however, was that no one knew where (or even who) some of the heirs were. If no heirs were to be found within 3 months, the entire $100 million francs would go to Perenna. And Lupin had a reputation as being something of a rogue. It is definitely a race against time, as the heirs seem to be turning up dead at an alarming rate." />
