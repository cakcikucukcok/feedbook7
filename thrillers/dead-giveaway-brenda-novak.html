          &lt;strong&gt;The Reverend &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lee Barker went missing nineteen years ago… And the people of Stillwater, Mississippi, believe they know why. They’re convinced he was murdered – by his stepson, Clay Montgomery. But only Clay – and his mother and sisters – can say for sure. They were the only ones there that fateful night, the only ones who know what really happened. And they’re not talking.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Allie McCormick is a cold-case detective from Chicago. After a particularly difficult divorce, she’s returned to Stillwater with her six-year-old daughter to find the peace she once knew in her home town and to work for the local police force while she’s starting over. But when Clay’s powerful enemies join forces to put him behind bars, Allie feels duty bound to uncover the truth. Her instincts tell her he didn’t murder the Reverend Lee Barker.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maybe Clay’s a dark and brooding man with more than his share of secrets, but he was just sixteen at the time. And he’s not a cold-blooded killer. At least, that’s what Allie believes – until she finds proof that behind the preacher’s pious demeanour lurked the heart of a monster. Then she has to ask herself whether justice has already been done…&lt;/p&gt;
