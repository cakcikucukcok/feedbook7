  <title>The King of Lies - John Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;John Hart creates a literary thriller that is as suspenseful as it is poignant, a riveting murder mystery layered beneath the southern drawl of a humble North Carolina lawyer. When Work Pickens finds his father murdered, the investigation pushes a repressed family history to the surface and he sees his own carefully constructed façade begin to crack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work&#39;s troubled sister, her combative girlfriend, his gold digging socialite wife, and an unrequited lifelong love join a cast of small town characters that create no shortage of drama in this extraordinary, fast-paced suspense novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hart&#39;s mastery of prose and plot belie his newcomer status as he explores the true heart of a man. An illuminating anatomy of a murder and the ripple effect it produces within a family and a community, &lt;i&gt;The King of Lies&lt;/i&gt; is a stunning debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now with an excerpt from John Hart&#39;s next book &lt;i&gt;The Hush&lt;/i&gt;, available February 2018.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
