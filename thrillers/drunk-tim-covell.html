  <title>Drunk - Tim Covell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Harry is a homeless drunk.  One night, to avoid freezing on the streets, he links up with Roland, a young Navajo drag queen.  Roland takes Harry in because he is reminded how his alcoholic father died of exposure.  Harry works his way into Roland&#39;s life, first out of a desire to stay in the comfortable apartment, but later out of desire for Roland.  Harry quits drinking and gets a job as a janitor.  Slowly, Harry and Roland build a life together.  However, a secret from Harry&#39;s past haunts them.&lt;p&gt;
A priest&#39;s brutal beating of Roland&#39;s best friend forces Harry to confront his past.  Neither the police nor private attorneys will help the beating victim fight the powerful church.   Faced with remaining silent and allowing the beating to go unpunished, or risking his newfound life by confronting his past, Harry chooses the later.&lt;p&gt;
With Roland&#39;s help, Harry faces his own crimes and reclaims his license to practice law.  So armed, he begins gathering evidence.  Along the way he must battle a corrupt attorney who will do anything to protect the interests of his top paying client. But Harry perseveres, bringing the case to trial where a surprise witness links the Archbishop to the scandal.&lt;p&gt;
