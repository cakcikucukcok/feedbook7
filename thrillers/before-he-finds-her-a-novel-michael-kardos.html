  <title>Before He Finds Her: A Novel - Michael Kardos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Everyone in the quiet Jersey Shore town of Silver Bay knows the story: on a Sunday evening in September 1991, Ramsey Miller threw a blowout block party, then murdered his beautiful wife and three-year-old daughter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But everyone is wrong. The daughter got away. Now she is nearly eighteen and tired of living in secrecy. Under the name Melanie Denison, she has spent the last fifteen years in small-town West Virginia as part of the Witness Protection Program. She has never been allowed to travel, go to a school dance, or even have internet at home. Precautions must be taken at every turn, because Ramsey Miller was never caught and might still be looking for his daughter. Yet despite strict house rules, Melanie has entered into a relationship with a young teacher at the local high school and is now ten weeks pregnant. She doesn&amp;#8217;t want her child to live in hiding as she has had to. Defying her guardians and taking matters into her own hands, Melanie returns to Silver Bay in hopes of doing what the authorities have failed to do: find her father before he finds her. Weaving in Ramsey&amp;#8217;s story in the three days leading up to the brutal crime, &lt;I&gt;Before He Finds Her&lt;/I&gt; is a stirring novel about love and faith and fear&amp;mdash;and how the most important things can become terribly distorted when we cling to them too fiercely.&lt;/div&gt;" />
