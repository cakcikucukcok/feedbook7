  <title>Eyes Without a Face - Robin Tracy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is a frigid day in 1969 when a tiny baby with hypnotizing green eyes is abandoned on the steps of a boarded-up orphanage. Destined to be raised by the aging nuns who live in a neighboring rectory, Rheyanne Christian is a strange, silent child who seems to live in a world of her own making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plagued by horrific nightmares that foretell tragic future events and haunted by a mysterious dark figure without a face, Rheyanne quickly learns she is not like other people. Convinced the dark spirit with the eyes of a beast is going to come for her one day, Rheyanne grows up fearful in a secluded but loving environment that protects her from the outside world. But when she is finally adopted by an abusive, money-hungry couple, Rheyanne becomes more determined than ever to rid her life of the faceless eyes. As she embarks on a desperate quest to learn the spirits true identity and intentions, Rheyanne has no idea she will soon be drawn into the ultimate battle between good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this gripping thriller, a girl born into a destiny she never asked for must return to her past for the answersbefore her nightmares come true.&lt;/p&gt;" />
