  <title>Among the Pillars - Michael Klast</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Public defender Evan Green is good at his job. Hes really good. It seems every case that falls into his lap is perfectly suited for himpractically a guaranteed win. His law firm depends on his success, and hes happy to oblige. Then comes a strange case that could lead Evan down the path to disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadine Crown seeks representation for her husband, Caleb, who faces a long list of weapons charges. Cocky as always, Evan takes the case, but he may be biting off more than he can chew. He now goes up against the Royal Canadian Air Forces star JAG officer, Captain James Thomas, and his record appears to be as winning as Evans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is called to the district courthouse of Vancouver, British Columbia, and Evan soon realizes this is much more than a situation of good versus bad, right versus wrong. His clients position has social implications. Who will fight for whom and at what cost? Evan could lose everything if it turns out hes on the wrong sideso is he willing to give up the glory in the name of justice?&lt;/p&gt;" />
