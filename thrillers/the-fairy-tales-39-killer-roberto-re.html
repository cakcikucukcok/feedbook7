  <title>The fairy tales&#39; killer - Roberto Re</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An abandoned rustic in a small town in the province of Turin.&lt;br /&gt;
Inside, the corpse of a man, tied to a bed, completely torn apart by animal bites. This is not what perplexes Luca Morelli - a Police Inspector who has a wild life and a broken family - when he comes to the place of the discovery.&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;#39;s indeed a storybook, left beside the victim: &amp;quot;Little Red Riding Hood.&amp;quot; Flanked by his colleague and former partner, Morena Camogli, he begins his investigation, made difficult by an absolute lack of evidence.&lt;br /&gt;
In an escalation of tension and difficulty, Morelli and his team try in every way to get to the solution.&lt;br /&gt;
Until a fortuitous discovery on the site of one of the crimes seems to open a chink in the investigation.&lt;br /&gt;
An opening that is lost back in time, into the past of the inspector &amp;#39;s tormented family .&lt;br /&gt;
Within a few days, three more murders rock the province of Turin, all committed by the same hand. And in all the cases, the murderer leaves his signature, a a storybook on the crime scene, a tale on which he stages the crime.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The killer of fairy tales&amp;quot; is the first novel in a series, focused on the investigation of Inspector Morelli." />
