          &lt;strong&gt;The dead of night… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The town of Lily, Arizona, has its share of Old West history and mystery. It’s also home to the Gilded Lily, a former theater…and bawdy house. These days it offers theatrical productions geared to tourists, but the recent discovery of a skull, a real skull, among the props and costumes has shaken everyone up.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So, who do you call? The Krewe of Hunters, a special FBI unit of paranormal investigators. In this case, it’s agent Jane Everett. Jane’s also a talented artist who creates images of the dead as they once were. But the Krewe always works with local law enforcement, and here that means Sloan Trent, ex-Houston cop and now sheriff.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He has connections that go deep within this small town. His great-great-grandmother was an actress at the Gilded Lily…as well as a Confederate spy. She’s not resting in peace and she lets him know it! Then more remains appear in the nearby desert. As they search for answers, using all the skills at their disposal, Jane and Sloan find themselves falling into danger—and into love&lt;/p&gt;
