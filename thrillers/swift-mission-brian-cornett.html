  <title>Swift Mission - Brian Cornett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Karin Jansen has gone missingright before heading off for vacation with her boyfriend, Deke Mitchell. She disappears under very suspicious circumstances, and the authorities cant help but think it has something to do with her high-profile job as a lawyer working for the United States Attorney General. But who would have the motive? Who would want Karin to disappearperhaps permanently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deke isnt your usual boyfriend, though. He works for the group known only as RECOM, the most secretive of the CIAs Black Op units, and hes on the verge of retiringuntil his boss calls him in to request Deke take on one more job. Twenty million dollars have gone missing in Pakistan, and the CIA suspects terrorists. Deke knows the Middle East better than anyone, so he doesnt have a choiceeven though hes having trouble reaching Karin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once overseas, the news that Karin has actually disappeared compounds the trouble he encounters from al-Qaeda soldiers. Now Deke is in a race against time to recover millions of dollars and save his girlfriends life. From northwestern Pakistan to the backwoods of West Virginia, this is Deke Mitchells final mission. Only time will tell, though, whether hell get out of the CIA alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
