  <title>Eternal Twins - Ruth Parker Riddle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sixteen-year-old Carrie Reed once led a charmed life, with her three siblings and loving parents. Then, her father seemingly went mad and murdered her mother. Suddenly, life was empty of love and joy. The Reed children were sent to live with their Aunt Tanya and Uncle Charlie. Things improved, but Carrie had trouble understanding what had happened to her parents. When had their love gone wrong? How could her father have done such a thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On her birthday, her aunt and uncle bought her an antique sapphire ring. Sapphire was Carries birthstone, and she adored her gift. Even so, Carrie had learned from her grandmother that certain objects retain the memories and feelings of the past owner. With the death of a distant relative named Irene, Carrie comes to realize that the ring may have been in her family for decadesand it might be cursed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strange things begin to happen to the Reed family, especially when the children get involved in witchcraft. Carrie is fascinated with the idea of the afterlife. She must find out what happens after deathbut she doesnt realize that communing with the dead can lead to tragedy in life. The curse of the ring has come back with a vengeance, and this time it has Carrie in its sights.&lt;/p&gt;" />
