After encountering his nightmare doppelganger in waking life, he must accept there&amp;rsquo;s no escaping from the cruel man he was in a previous lifetime. There&amp;rsquo;s no therapy that can fix his soul. No medicine.

Shadow Hex is trying to escape her dangerous ex-fianc&amp;eacute;, who works for the Secret Eye Agency&amp;mdash;a shadowy organization with sinister motives. He&amp;rsquo;ll always be after her.
