  <title>Mystery in the Bowels of the Earth - Yossi Soika-Afula</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dan and Sue are students in New York, but when Dans father gets the chance to travel to Israel, they quickly become world travelers. Dans father is a specialist in solar power, so he travels for an important conference. Dan and Sue travel for adventure, and before they know it, adventure finds them.
A street peddler harasses the pair until they finally buy an old book. The old book turns out to be a mysterious, hand-written journal with magical powers. They take the diary to a professor who can translate, and he seems to think the journal is quite old and might even contain maps of ancient Jerusalem. 
Dan and Sue soon find a foreigner closely related to the journal, and together, they uncover the secrets of a bewitched monastery in the Caracoram Mountains and an enormous cave illuminated by an enchanted light. The journal seems to hold a secret that dates back over two thousand years to the disappearance of ten Jewish tribes, but Dan and Sue are in over their heads as strangers in this strange land." />
