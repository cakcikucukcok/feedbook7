        &lt;p&gt;Nothing was as it seemed… Not even the protection Maddie Timmons was promised when she&#39;d entered the Witness Security Program. One of her handlers was missing, the other had burned her, and now Maddie was at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;All that stood between her and certain death was one sexy stranger.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Deep undercover, Recovery Project agent Adam Wright vowed to keep Maddie safe from the leak at WitSec. But Adam wasn&#39;t prepared for the confident woman he&#39;d rescued, the sensuous lover who got under his skin. He could do nothing about her past being taken away, but he&#39;d do anything to secure her future…even if it meant forsaking his own….&lt;/p&gt;
