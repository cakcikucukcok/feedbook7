  <title>Stay With Me - Alison Gaylin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When the past intersects with the future . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brenna Spector is held prisoner by the past. She has perfect memory, which allows her to recall in vivid and remarkable detail every moment of every day of her adult life. If only she could remember more from her child-hood . . . for she&#39;s still trying to unravel the mystery of her sister Clea&#39;s disappearance twenty-eight years ago when Clea was seventeen. But now her obsession with finding out what happened to Clea is taking a toll on her own teenage daughter, Maya, who&#39;s been very secretive lately. And when Maya goes missing, Brenna fears her worst nightmare has come true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . . the outcome can be dangerous&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Brenna relies on her P.I. skills to find her daughter before it&#39;s too late, evidence surfaces showing a possible link between Maya&#39;s disappearance and Clea&#39;s. But could a case from three decades ago really be connected to her daughter? Or is someone hoping that Brenna will play along in a twisted game&amp;#8212;one that there&#39;s no chance of winning . . . or surviving?&lt;/p&gt;" />
