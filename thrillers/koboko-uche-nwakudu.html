  <title>Koboko - Uche Nwakudu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Koboko
&lt;p&gt;
When Dr. Ted Milo Moro closed his successful medical practice in the USA and returned to his African homeland of WaZoBia, he had only one thing in mind; to run for political office and help bring about much needed reforms to WaZoBia. &lt;br&gt;
However, he soon realized that the problems that plague his homeland were way bigger than any one man and required much more than honorable intentions. &lt;br&gt;
Frustrated and nearly out of money after two years of trying to gain a foothold in the political arena of WaZoBia, he was faced with the option of either embracing corruption or packing his bags and returning to the US. He chose to embrace corruption and settled in to enjoy the spoils of high political office. &lt;br&gt;
But when a bizarre and near-fatal encounter with a swarm of an unknown species of wasps transforms him into a super human with formidable abilities, he becomes an unlikely hero to take on the scourge of crime and corruption in WaZoBia. &lt;br&gt;" />
