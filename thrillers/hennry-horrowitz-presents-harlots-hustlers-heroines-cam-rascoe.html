      <meta name="description" content="How are monsters created? Hear Henrys words as he narrates death. Brother to Hanna, beautiful young husband hustler star of Hanna Horrowitz Presents: The Husband Hustle parts 1 &amp; 2. Their lives are intertwined yet separate in so many ways. Children of Savanna creator of the Hustle both matured into narcissistic sociopaths. Hanna, never violent but very hurtful in her words and actions; her thoughts and feelings begin and end with her. Henry is a sharer of the pain; he first started hurting under the guise of protecting himself. Eventually he settled on the idea of hurting because it brought him great joy. Wealth and fortune comes easy for the two but the joy is always lacking. A God fearing faithful step father, after years of abuse converted the once scheming Savanna, saving her before he returned home to his creator. Can these two ever be saved? How are monsters created? Let Henry show you how." />
