  <title>The Tax Haven - Lawrence Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Two weeks after widowed Canadian management consultant, Lewis Ainslie, arrives at a tiny Caribbean tax haven for a much-needed break, he is thrilled he has no agenda for a change. Little does he know that as he reunites with former acquaintances on San Sebastian, they have just put a grand plan into action.
Sir Gordon Fairweather and his wife, Bunny, have decided Lewis is the perfect foil to help cover up their massive client fraud. Their archnemesis and former client, Arthur Fleming, has returned to the island with his wife, Delia, to recover his losses. Driven by separate motives, both women seduce the vulnerable Lewis. Bunny is financially dependent on her husband and driven by self-interest. And Delia Fleming is in reality Erica Persson, a Swiss investigator hired by Fleming to recover his stolen money. After Erica and Lewis become emotionally involved, he sets out on a dangerous journey to find out the truth about Fairweather and Fleming. But there is only one problem: Lewis has no idea who he can trust.
In this financial thriller set on an offshore tax haven, two powerful enemies desperate to secure an illicit fortune use bribery and passion to dupe an unsuspecting visitor who is forced to take matters into his own hands." />
