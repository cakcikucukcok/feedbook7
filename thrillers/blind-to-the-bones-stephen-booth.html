Except for the screaming.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small village in the Peak District, Withens is troubled by theft and vandalism, mostly generated by a family of local delinquents, the Oxleys. Now the town is the focus of a murder investigation. A man&amp;#8217;s body has been found on the bleak moors nearby, and the victim is an Oxley. To crack the case, DC Ben Cooper must break open the degenerate clan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His boss, DS Diane Fry, is also in Withens. Grim new evidence has turned up in the case of a missing student, but her parents refuse to believe she could be dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The darkness in Withens&amp;#8217;s heart is growing. And things are only going to get nastier &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;" />
