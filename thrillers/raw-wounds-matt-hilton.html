  <title>Raw Wounds - Matt Hilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tess Grey and Nicolas ‘Po’ Villere return to Louisiana to confront Po’s tormented past in this tense, action-packed thriller.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ex-con Nicolas ‘Po’ Villere has no love for the mother who abandoned him as a child. Yet when she asks to see him on her deathbed, he returns home to Louisiana with his partner Tess Grey to try to reconcile their troubled past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Po is not prepared for the news his mother gives him: that he is not the last of the Villere family line. He has a younger sister, Emilia, whom he’s never met. But Emilia is missing, and Tess and Po must track her down before it’s too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tess and Po aren’t the only ones looking for Emilia. As they are to discover, Emilia has disappeared for a very good reason – and if Po has any chance of finding her alive, he must join forces with his most hated enemy in order to prevent his little sister becoming the next victim of a deranged, cannibalistic killer." />
