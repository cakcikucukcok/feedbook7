  <title>Prescription for Revolution - Thomas H. Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When the phantom patriots realized that their quiet revolution had fallen short of cleaning up the government, they agreed to launch another more aggressive campaign to do so. The challenge was daunting, however, because to succeed they would have to overcome two obstacles. The first was that rich and powerful ultra conservatives had successfully used their wealth to corrupt congress and were using that leverage to sabotage governmental functions. Their ultimate objective was to have the government fail, freeing them of any regulations that would interfere with their effort to become wealthier. The second obstacle the patriots faced was the fact that this reality was being covered up by a news media predominately owned and/or operated by conservatives. Given these obstacles, the task of sufficiently informing a generally ignorant voting public of all this seemed rather daunting. But they came up with a plan, a prescription if you will, for getting the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using all the CIAs technical and financial resources available to them, they enlist Sidney Thurston, an investigative reporter they have in deep cover, write a compelling and informative novel that exposes both the corrupted and the corruptors. The novel becomes a bestseller, but since most voters seldom read, the patriots work to get the novel converted to a screen play for a movie that would be shown nationwide. But it was a significant challenge that required an extraordinary effort on their part.&lt;/p&gt;" />
