  <title>The Affairs of Men - Harvey E. Kaye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Harvey Kaye, emeritus assistant clinical professor of Psychiatry at New York Medical College, has spent decades analyzing matters of gender and sexual orientation. He&#39;s seen modern men lured by the siren song of the &quot;Masculine Mystique&quot; and pressured to fulfill the &quot;Dominance Drive&quot; and the &quot;Heroic Imperative.&quot;  The result is The Affairs of Men, a wry view of the masculine wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pressured by conflicting societal and familial standards, besieged by unrelenting demands to be sexier, wealthier, more successful, &quot;more of a man,&quot; men pay a price in marriage, in the bedroom, in the workplace, and most important, in their sense of identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s clear that men are at a cultural crossroads, facing difficult questions: Why do men attempt to achieve impossible goals?  How do gay men fit into overall images of masculinity?  Are traditional male-female relationship passé?  What roles should men take in their families?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Affairs of Men&lt;/i&gt; wittily illuminates the world of men, looking at both the origins of western society&#39;s image of masculinity and its current landscape. Dr. Kaye states that men must embrace a new vision of what it means to be a man. Men must give up the entrenched myth of superiority that has limited them for centuries. They must learn to experience all emotions, not just societally-approved anger, hatred, and jealousy. They must learn-from each other and from the women in their lives-what it is to be fully human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
