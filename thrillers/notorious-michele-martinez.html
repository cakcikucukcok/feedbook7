  <title>Notorious - Michele Martinez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;About to take a controversial rap star to trial for a past crime, Melanie Vargas receives an important piece of information from his lawyer. In full confidence, on the steps of New York City&#39;s federal courthouse, he tells her that his client may have had ties to a wanted fugitive. Moments later, a powerful car bomb blows the man to pieces, with Melanie only steps away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As shocking as the murder is, it has other repercussions for Melanie. Her relationship with the victim wasn&#39;t strictly professional. While recovering from her breakup with FBI agent Dan O&#39;Reilly, she had become attracted to the charismatic lawyer. But after his death she realizes that she knew very little about him&amp;#8212;including the fact that he was married.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determined to find the killer, Melanie enters a dangerous world of subterfuge and double-crosses, going as far as the glittering lights of Vegas to discover the truth. But the more she digs, the more she finds troubling about her friend. Several people had the motive to end his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the rapper&#39;s defense has been taken over by the slickest shark in the business, a man of questionable morals who may have had previous unlawful dealings with his client. But the outcome of the case isn&#39;t the only thing on the line. As the sole witness to the murder, Melanie is in danger of losing her own life. And it isn&#39;t long before she realizes that she can&#39;t trust anybody, not even those closest to her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
