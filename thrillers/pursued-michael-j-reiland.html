  <title>Pursued - Michael J Reiland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Michael Rudy is a professional assassin who is comfortable with his ruthless jobuntil the day he decides he has had enough. After he loots cash meant for an impending drug deal and flees America for Paris to live out the rest of his days in peace, an unanticipated darkness follows him. Even after he is reunited with Stacy, the only woman he has ever loved, their reignited passion emerges from tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stacy and her associate, Arnaud, begin to suspect there is something too coincidental between Michaels appearance in Paris and their organizations downfall. The wrong people are dying and no one seems to know why or who is behind it. As Michael, Stacy, and Arnaud all attempt to follow the seemingly unconnected events, friends turn into enemies and contacts go cold. While Michael is forced to choose between lying to Stacy or to the people who want him to kill again, Stacy is compelled to question whether her love for Michael can withstand the chaos that surrounds them. Even if they survive, will their passion for each other continue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pursued&lt;/i&gt; weaves betrayal and blackmail with passion and love amid the streets of Paris as a renowned assassin discovers it may be more difficult to escape his past than he realized.&lt;/p&gt;" />
