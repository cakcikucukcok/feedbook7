  <title>Crack Spell - Keith Norton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Teresa, Judy and Nancy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are under the spell of smoking Crack Cocaine. If youve ever been addicted to the pleasurable, but 
devastating narcotic you personally know how hard it is to kick or escape the destructive habit of using 
the drug.Those who have loved ones that have succumbed to the drug will understand why they behaved the way 
they did when they were using one of the most popular and dangerous substances of our day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trevor 
Karp is a major dealer in the story, and reaps what he sows in the selling of the devilish substance. A 
host of other characters are weaved into this story of hope and sobriety.Norton is a 44 year old writer 
that was born and raised in Jacksonville,Florida.Hes an ex-athlete that received a full scolarship to play 
collegiate basketball out of high school in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keiths main aim for writing Crack Spell was so 
that the youth wouldnt be naive or ignorant about the most addictive narcotic of our day. He was also 
motivated about writing on the subject of crack-cocaine because of what the drug was doing to the community 
and those that are close to him.The only queens hes ever known, his grandmother Ethel Noisette and his 
mother Angela Fuzz Noisette raised the author with the mindset that with education one can do whatever 
they set their minds to. His aunt Beverly Robinson was also very instumental in his upbringing. To all of 
us that are living on Gods green earth the auhor states: Lets love and care for each other, no matter 
what.Peace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
