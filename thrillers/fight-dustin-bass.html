  <title>Fight - Dustin Bass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why would you avenge the murder of someone you hardly know? For a small time criminal like Fight, the answer is simple: principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hearing his father has been knocked off by the citys biggest crime boss, Fight, joined by several friends, goes on a violent rampage to settle the score. New to the game of high stakes crime, their rookie criminal mistakes start to catch up to them when they accidentally double-cross another crime boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lies and deceit are the only two options Fight has to stay a step ahead of the crime bosses. With nothing to live for in a city shot to hell, he decides to engage in an all-out war, but soon finds he is fighting for a lot more than just principle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
