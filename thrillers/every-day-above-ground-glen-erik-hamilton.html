      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A favor for a dying ex-con turns into a violent battle against a mysterious enemy for Van Shaw in this emotionally powerful and gritty thriller from the award-winning author of &lt;em&gt;Past Crimes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hard Cold Winter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like a thief&amp;#8217;s dream to Van Shaw: A terminally ill ex-con tells him of an easy fortune in gold, abandoned and nearly forgotten after its original owner died in prison. For the dying man, the money is a legacy to ensure his preteen daughter&amp;#8217;s future. For Van, the gold is cash he desperately needs to rebuild his destroyed family home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grandson of a career criminal who taught him all the tricks of his trade, Van suspects that nothing is ever that easy. Sure enough, the safe holding the fortune is a trap&amp;#8212;set by a mysterious player armed with tremendous resources and a lifetime of hatred. Now, Shaw&amp;#8217;s partner is in the clutches of the hunters, and the former army ranger may be their next prey. But when the ex-con&amp;#8217;s innocent daughter is threatened too, Van&amp;#8217;s own hard childhood means he can&amp;#8217;t let her come to harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To discover who has them in the cross hairs, Shaw must seek out the hunters&amp;#8217; real prey. His quest leads him from an underground bare-knuckle fighting ring, which may be fronting a darker purpose, to a massive pop-culture convention, where Van and his allies, Hollis and Corcoran, play a dangerous game with foes on every side. It also introduces Van to a brash and beautiful aspiring journalist who poses a whole different kind of personal risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Van Shaw has tried to live every day above ground, on the right side of the law, even though crime is his gift . . . and in his blood. If he survives the coming storm, he&amp;#8217;ll have to decide what he wants&amp;#8212;and whether he can live as an outlaw without sacrificing his honor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
