  <title>Auschwitz - Ss Death Camp - S. M. Janes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a race against time Nazi Germany must, at any cost, be prevented from accomplishing its goal: European domination through the might of the Atomic Bomb.
It is June 1942 when Josef Mortkowicz, one of Americas pre-eminent scientists, volunteers to infiltrate and sabotage the Reichs parallel nuclear research programme. Events, however, do not go according to plan. Arrested for a minor offence, identified as a Jew and deported to Auschwitz at a time the world knows nothing of the atrocities being perpetrated in the East (the Final Solution a still unknown concept), the Allies have but a few weeks at most to convince the Nazis they have unwittingly captured an absconded key physicist from Washingtons top secret Manhattan Project.
Lieutenant Miller and his team are sent deep into enemy territory with the urgent brief to rescue and return. But to succeed they must fail. Mortkowicz has to be brought to the attention of the Nazis with cover intact and so Miller is hindered with orders to take rookie W/T operator, Christa Lynton. A combination of insubordination and sheer bad luck results in the teams imprisonment in Hitlers most infamous concentration camp where young Christa is subjected to the horrors of physical abuse, mental torture and sexual degradation by her Nazi assailant, SS Untersturmfhrer Kramer. Cruelly exploited by both Miller and Kramer we see how this vulnerable girls decisions and actions, as she fights for survival in an unimaginably inhumane world, influence the outcome of this most crucial of missions.
Auschwitz  SS Death Camp skilfully blends fact with fiction taking the reader into the very heart of the camps SS hierarchy: a nightmare realm with no rules." />
