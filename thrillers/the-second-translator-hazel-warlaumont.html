  <title>The Second Translator - Hazel Warlaumont</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Second Translator unfolds on the eve of the bloody terrorist train bombings in Madrid and winds its way through Spain, Rome, South Africa, New York, and Boston bringing with it a tale of intrigue, danger, and betrayal. Its young hero, a translator named Martin Lambert, is swept up by the turmoil and revelation that the terrorists attack could be retribution for an old treaty between the Muslims and Catholics that he suspects might have been mistranslated in modern times to protect the riches and treasures of the Catholic Church. 
Struggling with his own disillusionments and staying out of danger, Martins search for the original treaty is complicated by his intense attraction to a Spanish dancer while at the same time being pulled closer to the woman whos been in his life. Inspired by true events and interwoven with fictional creations, The Second Translator represents a novelistic expression of the dilemma between conformity and adventure, echoing the bane and dissatisfaction witnessed in contemporary society." />
