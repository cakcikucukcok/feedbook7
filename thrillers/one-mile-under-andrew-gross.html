Trey Watkins&amp;#39;s death is ruled an accident. Finding evidence that seems to back up her suspicions that it wasn&amp;#39;t, she takes her case to Wade Dunn, the local police chief and her ex-stepfather, with whom she shares some unresolved history. Wade insists the case is closed, but Rooster, a hot air balloon operator in town, claims he saw something from the air she should know.

Together, the two step into a sinister scheme running deep beneath the surface of a quiet, Colorado town that has made a deal with the devil to survive. But in the square off between giant energy companies and beaten-down ranchers and farmers, one resource is even more valuable in this drought-stricken region than oil. They both will kill for it&amp;#8212;water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One Mile Under&lt;/em&gt; is a thrilling rapid run of hair-raising twists and unforeseen turns set against one of the most provocative environmental issues of our time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
