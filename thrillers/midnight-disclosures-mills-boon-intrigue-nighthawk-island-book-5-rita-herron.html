          &lt;strong&gt;In one tragic moment, Claire Kos had lost everything - her sight, her unborn child, the love of her life - but she survived.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, when a serial killer started calling the beautiful radio psychologist, bragging about his &quot;conquests,&quot; Claire had to turn to the one man she never thought she&#39;d meet again. Mark Steele had been her whole world. Now he was simply an FBI agent working on the Midnight Murderer case.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She couldn&#39;t allow personal feelings to interfere, but how could she stop remembering his roguish smile, his passionate touch? When the killer targeted Claire as his next victim, could Mark truly protect her when he had the power to hurt her most of all?&lt;/p&gt;
