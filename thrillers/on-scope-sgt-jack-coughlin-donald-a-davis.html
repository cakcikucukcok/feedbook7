  <title>On Scope - Sgt. Jack Coughlin, Donald A. Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Spain is on the brink of economic collapse and European banks demand that any bailout be linked to harsh domestic changes. An alliance of Islamic bankers counters with a rescue package containing no conditions at all. The underlying goal: to break the unity of Europe and put Madrid on the path back to Islamic rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the United States stridently opposes that deal, terrorists storm the American consulate in Barcelona and slaughter an entire six-man U.S. Marine security guard. Washington decides the time has come to change the rules of counter-terrorism response, and instead of going after the individual hired gunmen, it unleashes black operations team Task Force Trident to take down the high-ranking financiers known as the Group of Six who were really responsible for the slaughter. Gunnery Sergeant Kyle Swanson, one of the world&#39;s best snipers, and his beautiful sidekick Beth Ledford, go on the attack, and bodies fall from Mallorca to Madrid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Algerian mastermind Yanis Rebiane puts pressure on Spain to decide before the Group of Six cracks, while his killing-machine son, Djahid roams the United States, murdering anyone his father deems a threat to the radical Islamic takeover scheme. Once Swanson&#39;s name is unearthed from secret files, Kyle and Djahid become hunter and prey. In &lt;i&gt;On Scope &lt;/i&gt;by Jack Coughlin and Donald A. Davis, one shot will decide the future of Spain, NATO, and the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;" />
