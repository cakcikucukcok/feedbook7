      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Say No More: &lt;/i&gt;The Thrilling Next Installment in Hank Phillippi Ryan&#39;s Award-Winning Jane Ryland Series!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Boston reporter Jane Ryland reports a hit and run, she soon learns she saw more than a car crash--she witnessed the collapse of an alibi. Working on an expose of sexual assaults on college campuses for the station&#39;s new documentary unit, Jane&#39;s just convinced a date rape victim to reveal her heartbreaking experience on camera. However, a disturbing anonymous message--SAY NO MORE--has Jane really and truly scared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homicide detective Jake Brogan is on the hunt for the murderer of Avery Morgan, a hot-shot Hollywood screenwriter. Her year as a college guest lecturer just ended at the bottom of her swimming pool in the tight-knit and tight-lipped Boston community called The Reserve. As Jake chips his way through a code of silence as shatterproof as any street gang, he&#39;ll learn that one newcomer to the neighborhood may have a secret of her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A young woman faces a life-changing decision--should she go public about her assault? Jane and Jake--now semi-secretly engaged and beginning to reveal their relationship to the world--are both on a quest for answers as they try to balance the consequences of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
