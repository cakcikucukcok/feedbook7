  <title>Dying Breath - Helen Phifer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;WOW...Double WOW...What a fantastic book...I could not put it down&amp;#x2026;twists and turns throughout and what a brilliant ending...a big fat 5* for this brilliant book&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;#x2019; (5 stars) Goodreads reviewer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The woman&amp;#x2019;s face was pale and waxy. Her milky, partially open eyes stared into the distance. There were drag marks in the grass; she&amp;#x2019;d been placed here and posed. &lt;i&gt;Who did this to you and why have they left you like this?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a woman&amp;#x2019;s body is found on a lonely patch of scrubland, &lt;b&gt;Detective Lucy Harwin&lt;/b&gt; is called to the scene. The victim&amp;#x2019;s clothes have been wrenched to expose her, and her feet are bare. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy and her team have only just started investigating who could have wanted local mother &lt;b&gt;Melanie Benson&lt;/b&gt; dead, when a young woman is discovered strangled in a dark alley. As more bodies appear in the run-down seaside town, the small community is gripped by fear, and the pressure to solve the case becomes unbearable. But with each victim dying in a different way, Lucy struggles to find a link between the murders. Are these random killings, or part of the same plan? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as she thinks she&amp;#x2019;s getting close, Lucy starts to suspect the killer is watching her. Can she find the murderer before they strike again, or will she be next?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An absolutely gripping serial-killer thriller that will have your heart pounding as you race through the pages. If you love Kathy Reichs, Karin Slaughter or Robert Dugoni, &lt;i&gt;Dying Breath&lt;/i&gt; will have you hooked.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read what everyone is saying about &lt;i&gt;Dying Breath&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;&lt;b&gt;Loved this book so much&lt;/b&gt;.
