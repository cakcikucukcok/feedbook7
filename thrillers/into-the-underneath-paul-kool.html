  <title>Into the Underneath - Paul Kool</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Frankie Callahan is a man walking the thin line between sanity and insanity. From the time his father died when he was a child and his mother had to move him and his brother Pete to the notorious south end of Boston, life had become little more than a seemingly endless series of disappointments and heartaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At age twenty Pete was killed in a gang shooting; years later Frankie lost his mom to cancer; and then the final insult; finding out purely by accident that Naomi, his wife of ten years had not only been poisoning him for the money his mother left him but was also carrying on an adulterous affair with his stepfather as part of an insurance scam which was cut short by Frankies moms untimely and unexpected passing from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankie had become the new target. But after years of excusing her psychologically abusive behavior towards him due to his kind nature and the fact that he for some reason loved her deeply he reached his breaking point and decided that Naomi and his beloved stepfather would have to pay the ultimate price and die for their sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After careful planning and research Frankie decides to transform himself into the most unlikely of killers in this game of kill me if you can only to find himself hopelessly lost in the murky psychological abyss that exists in the desolate badlands between fantasy and realityhe had ventured too far; &lt;i&gt;INTO THE UNDERNEATH!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
