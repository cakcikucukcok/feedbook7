          &lt;strong&gt;It was a dream come true.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Buying a run-down farm in a beautiful Vermont town is the start of a new life for Sophie Davis. She moves her mother and half sister out of the city, hoping it will help both women sort out their lives. And for Sophie, turning Stonegate Farm into a country inn is the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. She doesn&#39;t even mind that the farm was the scene of a murder twenty years ago….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When a stranger moves in next door, Sophie believes the peace she has built for herself and her family is being threatened. Because there&#39;s something different about John Smith. It&#39;s clear he&#39;s keeping secrets…and that he&#39;s come to Vermont, for a reason. And that reason has something to do with Sophie and Stonegate Farm.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now her dream is becoming a nightmare. Who is John Smith? Why does he make feel so out of control? And why is she beginning to suspect that this mysterious stranger will put in jeopardy everything she&#39;s dreamed of–maybe even her own life?&lt;/p&gt;
