  <title>The Third Terrace of Purgatory - K. R. Barker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dan Taylor works in a bank in Sydney. One New Years Eve, his life is transformed by a car accident. When he wakes in a hospital, he knows something has fundamentally changed, a change that sets him on a journey to London to find the answers to the dreams and visions that have plagued his subconscious.
The revelations in London are more disturbing than he could have imagined, all the more so when he meets his nemesis, Robert MacBain, a small-time crook from Edinburgh. It soon becomes apparent that the past holds a dark mystery that has bound their destinies together. 
Taylor recognizes that he needs to identify the source of a conflict that has resulted in the death and misery of so many, and to finally find his path to a personal redemption.
Redemption is the final part of the trilogy, The Third Terrace of Purgatory." />
