  <title>And Into the Fire - Robert Gleason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With an undeniable authority on the subject of all things nuclear, Robert Gleason brings readers&#39; worst fears surrounding nuclear terrorism to life in this character-driven, page-turning thriller, &lt;i&gt;And Into the Fire.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After allying itself with Pakistan&#39;s intelligence services and notorious terrorist group, the Tehrik-e-Taliban-Pakistan (TTP), ISIS is ready to achieve its ultimate dream: Forcing the US into a clash of civilizations in the Mideast.  The best way to accomplish this mission is to acquire three Pakistani nukes--then set them off in three US cities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The head of the CIA&#39;s Pakistan desk, Elena Moreno, and an intrepid journalist, Jules Meredith, are on their trail. Unfortunately, a powerful Saudi ambassador is blackmailing a corrupt American president, and now both men will do anything to stop these two women--to the point of having them killed. All the while, a notorious Pakistani terrorist, who twenty years ago was Elena&#39;s college lover, is leading a highly skilled, highly trained terrorist team into the US.  They are armed with three Hiroshima-style nukes and are hell-bent on incinerating the three American cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can the two women stop them?  The clock is ticking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
