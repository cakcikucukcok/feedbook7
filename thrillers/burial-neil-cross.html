      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyone makes mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if your biggest mistake was something you could never live down?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something so awful and despicable that it weighs daily on your soul? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nathan has never been able to forget the worst night of his life.  Only he and an old acquaintance know what really happened and they have made a pact to keep silent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, years later, a knock on his door brings terrifying news.  Old wounds are suddenly reopened, threatening to tear Nathan&#39;s whole world apart, as he comes face to face with the bleak landscape of lies and deception that has become his life.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Burial&lt;/i&gt; is the story of one man&#39;s obsession with redemption.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you ever really bury your guiltiest secret? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
