  <title>Sacrifice - Sharon Bolton, S. J. Bolton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For only $6.99: Inspired by an ancient legend, Sharon Bolton&#39;s critically acclaimed debut follows the shocking investigation of a decades-long pattern of kidnapping and murder.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this masterful debut that starts off as a mystery and becomes much more, Tora Hamilton is an outsider at her new home on the rocky, windswept Shetland Islands, a hundred miles from the northeastern tip of Scotland. Though her husband grew up here, it&#39;s the first time he&#39;s been back in twenty years. Digging in the peat on their new property, Tora unearths a human body: at first glance a centuries-old bog body, interesting but not uncommon. But realizing that the body is in fact much newer, that the woman&#39;s heart has been cut out and that she was killed within a few days of bearing a child, Tora, herself an obstetrician, becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her--even when the police, her colleagues, and eventually her husband warn her against getting involved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reading town records and researching local lore, Tora discovers a disturbing link to ancient Shetland legend and uncovers a collection of deep, dark secrets--the kind of secrets worth killing for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sacrifice&lt;/i&gt; is a bone-chilling, spellbinding debut that will grip readers from its beginning to its startling end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;*BONUS CONTENT: This edition of &lt;i&gt;Sacrifice&lt;/i&gt; includes a new introduction from the author and a discussion guide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
