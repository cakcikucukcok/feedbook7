  <title>The Enigmatic Mr Phelps - David B. Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;32-Red&quot; &amp; &quot;Berlin by Christmas&quot;combine to become&quot;The Enigmatic Mr Phelps&quot; The sequel to the late 1990&#39;s set &quot;32-Red&quot;, brings Oscar Phelps into the new century with a certain gusto and a very personal mission to be relentlessly pursued. &quot;32-Red&quot; and the previously unpublished &quot;Berlin by Christmas&quot; provide in combination for the delivery of a Vintage Story of Elaborate Subterfuge, Contemporary Murder, Moot Conscience and Guiltless Precision. Woven amidst a Rich Tapestry of Traditional Values and Delicious Amorality. Oscar Phelps is a little older, a little wiser, but still constantly in search... This International Thriller follows the exploits of &quot;32-Red&quot;&#39;s Fraudster, Psychopath, Manipulator, Impresario, Raconteur, Wit, Killer and Friend as he continues relentless pursuit of the song of life. Oscar has survived into the third millennium with enhanced knowledge, decorum and wit. His business &quot;associations&quot; take him now to the Raffles city of Singapore, experiencing the antiquities of Venice, the zest of Hong Kong, the last great bastion of the Empire. To Budapest, Paris, London, Nice, San Francisco, Niagara, Tokyo, Australia and a rejuvenated Berlin. Oscar has a new nemesis, a new &quot;Buffalo&quot; Bertram Keelan to contend with. This time, a more worthy, more dangerous and ultimately more personal adversary. Recently widowed, Oscar finds himself seeking to avenge the death of his wife Lori. Killed by a mis-directed act of aggression from an unlikely assailant. Oscar begins his quest with the help of friends on whom he can rely. Plotting his objectives, without conscience, limit or boundary. Oscar the anti-hero, the &quot;Dear, Dear Boy&quot; will not allow anyone or anything to stop him as he flushes out his prey. With loyal Bostonian henchman Trent Alexis in tow, Oscar moves from within his shroud of sadness, stridently, purposefully, full of guile, with The Wisdom to Remember and the Courage to effect Change." />
