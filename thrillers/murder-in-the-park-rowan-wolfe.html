  <title>Murder in the Park - Rowan Wolfe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A deputy legal counsel to the White House is found dead in Fort Marcy Park, and after an investigation marred with mistakes and inconsistencies, his death is finally ruled a suicide.
Eight years later, a new president is determined to clean-up all his predecessors dirty laundry by offering the mission to the newly promoted Lt. Col. Michael Correa, U.S. Army Special Forces.
Seeing as who could be implicated in Victor Fallons death, I thought youd jump at the chance, he tells Michael. Reluctantly accepting the covert mission, along with a small, handpicked team, the commander-in-chief reminds Michael that the jungles now concrete and the enemy wears suits.
After reading the official report on Fallons death, Michaels first stop is the former first lady, Harriet Pearson, who from the outset begins to plot with CIA deputy director, Charles Ashburn, on ways to rid themselves of Michael - permanently.
The terrorist attacks on 9/11 interrupt the mission, but eleven months later, Michael resurfaces, more determined than ever to expose Harriets illegal activities. The list of homicides quickly grows. With an undercover DEA agent now in the mix, a high seas kidnapping that involves the U.S. Coast Guard, and a narcotics detective from Miami P.D., the investigation gathers speed. When the Most Wanted leader of a Colombian drug cartel is also implicated, Michael resorts to unleashing his Special Forces teammates, with the help of a Global Hawk UAV, in a high-risk takedown. All Michael and the team have to do, while connecting all the dots, is stay alive and prevent Michaels father, Francis, the returning director of the CIA, from learning too much.
Will the former first lady get away with murder?
The outcome is guaranteed to surprise you.
This is the third book in the series, and the reader will again meet some familiar characters in Rowan Wolfes well-researched and fast-paced thriller.
