  <title>Extreme Measures (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - Brenda Harlen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Colin McIver is back in town, and the only person who isn&#39;t thrilled by the return of the hometown hero is his ex-wife, Nikki Gordon. She just wants to know when he&#39;s leaving. Because Colin &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; leaves. And this time, she hopes he&#39;ll be gone before he can discover the secret she&#39;s kept hidden for five long years…their daughter, Carly!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A murderous stalker is after Colin, who is seeking only solitude and anonymity. Learning about his little girl only makes him more determined to stay and win Nikki&#39;s trust again. But when danger strikes too close to home, Colin has to risk everything he holds dear to protect his family. Will his attempt cost him the woman and child he loves–forever?&lt;/p&gt;
