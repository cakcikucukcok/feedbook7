  <title>The Knowledge - Martha Grimes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With their signature wit, sly plotting, and gloriously offbeat characters, Martha Grimes’s &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Richard Jury mysteries are “utterly unlike anyone else’s detective novels” (&lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;). In the latest series outing, &lt;i&gt;The Knowledge&lt;/i&gt;, the Scotland Yard detective nearly meets his match in a Baker Street Irregulars-like gang of kids and a homicide case that reaches into east Africa.&lt;p&gt;  
Robbie Parsons is one of London’s finest, a black cab driver who knows every street, every theater, every landmark in the city by heart. In his backseat is a man with a gun in his hand—a man who brazenly committed a crime in front of the Artemis Club, a rarefied art gallery-cum-casino, then jumped in and ordered Parsons to drive. As the criminal eventually escapes to Nairobi, Detective Superintendent Richard Jury comes across the case in the Saturday paper.&lt;p&gt; 
Two days previously, Jury had met and instantly connected with one of the victims of the crime, a professor of astrophysics at Columbia and an expert gambler. Feeling personally affronted, Jury soon enlists Melrose Plant, Marshall Trueblood, and his whole gang of merry characters to contend with a case that takes unexpected turns into Tanzanian gem mines, a closed casino in Reno, Nevada, and a pub that only London’s black cabbies, those who have “the knowledge,” can find. &lt;i&gt;The Knowledge&lt;/i&gt; is prime fare from “one of the most fascinating mystery writers today” (&lt;i&gt;Houston Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;)." />
