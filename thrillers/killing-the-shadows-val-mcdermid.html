  <title>Killing the Shadows - Val McDermid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A killer is on the loose, blurring the line between fact and fiction. His prey - the writers of crime novels who have turned psychological profilers into the heroes of the nineties. But this killer is like no other. His bloodlust shatters all the conventional wisdom surrounding the motives and mechanics of how serial killers operate. And for one woman, the desperate hunt to uncover his identity becomes a matter of life and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Fiona Cameron is an academic psychologist who uses computer technology to help police forces track serial offenders. She used to help the Met, but vowed never to work for them again when they went against her advice and subsequently botched an investigation. Still smarting from the experience, she&#39;s working a case in Toledo when her lover, thriller writer Kit Martin, tells her a fellow crime novelist has been murdered. It&#39;s not her case, but Fiona can&#39;t help taking an interest. When the killer strikes again Fiona finds herself caught in a race against time - not only to save a life but also to find redemption, both personal and professional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich in atmosphere, Val McDermid&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Killing the Shadows&lt;/i&gt; uses the backdrops of city and country to create an air of threatening menace, culminating in a tense confrontation between hunter and hunted, a confrontation that can have only one outcome.&lt;/p&gt;" />
