  <title>Duke with Benefits - Manda Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LADY + DUKE = TRUE LOVE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady Daphne Forsyth is a brilliant mathematician with a burning passion for puzzles. When she learns that the library belonging to her benefactress houses the legendary Cameron Cipher--an encrypted message that, once solved, holds the key to great riches--Daphne is on the case. Unfortunately, her race to unlock the cipher&#39;s code is continually thwarted by a deliciously handsome distraction she hadn&#39;t counted on. . .and cannot resist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dalton Beauchamp, the Duke of Maitland, is curious as to why Daphne is spending so much time snooping around his aunt&#39;s bookshelves. He&#39;s even more intrigued by her bold yet calculating manner: She is unapologetic about her secret quest. . .and the fiery attraction that develops between them both. But how can they concentrate on solving a perplexing enigma once the prospect of true love enters the equation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Witty, sensual historical romance that will captivate &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;readers.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Romance Junkies&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Duke with Benefits&lt;/i&gt; is the second in Manda Collins&#39; Studies in Scandal series set in Regency England.&lt;/p&gt;" />
