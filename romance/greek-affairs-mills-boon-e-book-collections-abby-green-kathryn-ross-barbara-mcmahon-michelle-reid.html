        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Greek playboy Aristotle Levakis can have his pick of any woman so why does his body crave the one woman who should be out of bounds – his prim and curvy assistant Lucy Proctor? He knows there is only one way to overcome this desire – and that is to sate it!&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;strong&gt; The Markonos Bride:&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It has been five years since tragedy destroyed Andreas Markonos’s marriage to Louisa. Yet in all that time Andreas has never filed for divorce – why? Simply because Louisa has no equal – in his bed – or in his heart; it is time he reclaimed his bride…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Also includes: The Greek Tycoon&#39;s Reluctant Bride, Greek Doctor, Cinderella Bride Greek Affairs: Tempted by the Tycoons includes titles by Kate Hewitt, Annie West, Katherine Garbera&lt;/em&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finding out he’s a father has left billionaire businessman Lukas Petrakides in a bit of a bind – how can he combine his passions in life – business and women – with full-ime fatherhood? His solution is simple, Rhiannon, the baby’s temporary guardian, will make a very convenient wife…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Also includes: The Greek Tycoon&#39;s Unexpected Wife, The Greek Tycoon&#39;s Unexpected Heir&lt;/em&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nikos Theakis happily paid Ann Turner a huge sum to claim his orphaned nephew and, though it broke her heart, Ann let her little ward go. But now young Ari needs Ann and Nikos will stop at nothing to see the boy happy, not even making Ann his mistress…&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Milos Stephanides has never forgotten – or forgiven! – Helen Shaw walking away from their affair. So when he meets her again by chance his goal is clear – to soothe his wounded pride he means to take his sweet revenge by seduction!&lt;/p&gt;
