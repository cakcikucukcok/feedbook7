          &lt;strong&gt;Mills &amp; Boon are excited to present The Anne Mather Collection – the complete works by this classic author made available to download for the very first time! These books span six decades of a phenomenal writing career, and every story is available to read unedited and untouched from their original release.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;In danger of getting burnt?&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Sara is left alone in the world after her father’s death, she is glad to accept her ‘aunt’ Harriet’s invitation to become her companion. But when she arrives, she realises it may not be the ideal solution – especially when she meets the enigmatic Jude. Just who is he, and what is his relationship to her aunt? One moment they are close, the next, Jude is just as contemptuous of Harriet as everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;So why does Sara begin to feel more and more attracted to Jude? Sara knows it wouldn’t be wise to get too close – but she is finding his flickering flame more and more impossible to resist…&lt;/p&gt;
