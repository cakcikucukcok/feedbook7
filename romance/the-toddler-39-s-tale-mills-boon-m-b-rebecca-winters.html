  <title>The Toddler&#39;s Tale (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Rebecca Winters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Max Jamison had been a good cop, and now he was a good P.I. Still, it shook him to be faced with what seemed to be a replay of his past–a baby depending on him for rescue! And his only ally was &quot;The Black Widow,&quot; Chelsea Markum.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chelsea Markum, relentless reporter for &lt;em&gt;Tattle Today TV&lt;/em&gt;, knew a hot story when she saw one–and a trapped toddler was it! Yet here she was with no camcorder, thanks to Max Jamison, and the strangest urge to help!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In her wildest dreams, Chelsea wouldn&#39;t have seen herself &lt;em&gt;singing&lt;/em&gt; at the scene of a disaster, but if that&#39;s what it took to comfort the child… Neither would she ever have imagined teaming up with Max Jamison, or their falling in love…. But she was beginning to believe the old saying that &quot;truth is stranger than fiction.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
