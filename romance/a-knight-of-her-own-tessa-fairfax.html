      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sir Drogo LaForce has spent a lifetime chasing the family honor and wealth denied him by his bastard birth. A clever scheme to uncloak a traitor against the Crown finally promises to win him everything he desires...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady Isabel has been in hiding ever since an evil Norman lord killed her father and usurped her English lands. But her plot to avenge her father and free her people is threatened when a mysterious Norman knight abducts her with plans to use her for espionage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drogo&#39;s fascinating captive is nothing like he anticipated. Outspoken but innocent, Isabel reluctantly submits to Drogo&#39;s tutoring in the spymaster&#39;s craft, as well as the art of making love. But their potent attraction nearly leads to disaster. In the end they must decide between their dueling appetites for riches and revenge...or love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Rogues of Rouen series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Come to Me&lt;br&gt;* A Knight of Her Own&lt;/p&gt;" />
