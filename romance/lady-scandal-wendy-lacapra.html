Now she exists outside of polite society&#39;s influence, holding gambling parties for London&#39;s most dangerous men.

Even as his gamble of marriage starts to spiral out of control and his passions ignite, Randolph is determined that he&#39;ll handle things his way...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when danger closes in, Randolph won&#39;t just have to protect Sophia from an intended killer. He&#39;ll have to protect her from himself...&lt;/p&gt;" />
