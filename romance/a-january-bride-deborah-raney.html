  <title>A January Bride - Deborah Raney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A year&amp;rsquo;s worth of novellas from twelve inspirational romance authors. Happily ever after guaranteed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will happen when novelist Madeleine Houser&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;pen pal&amp;rdquo; friendship with a lonely widower takes an unexpected turn?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who can work in a house that&#39;s overrun by contractors and carpenters? Not Madeleine Houser, a successful novelist who gladly accepts the help of her octogenarian friend, Ginny, to arrange for a temporary office in the charming bed and breakfast owned by Ginny&#39;s friend, Arthur. Maddie&amp;rsquo;s never met the innkeeper&amp;mdash;but a friendship grows between them as Maddie and Arthur leave messages for each other each day. To Maddie&amp;rsquo;s alternate delight and chagrin, she seems to be falling for the inn&amp;rsquo;s owner&amp;mdash;a man who&#39;s likely many years her senior&amp;mdash;and who she&amp;rsquo;s never even met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arthur Tyler is a college professor who lost his young wife to cancer. Together they ran the bed and breakfast where Art lives, but without his wife, the house is missing warmth and cheer. He jumps at the chance to have author Madeleine Houser use the space that was once filled with guests. He, too, begins to enjoy the daily exchanges with Maddie, but a series of misunderstandings lead him to believe she&amp;rsquo;s far from being a prospective date&amp;mdash;even if he were ready to date again, which he&amp;rsquo;s not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Maddie and Art finally meet and discover one another&amp;rsquo;s identity, sparks fly. Even so, they each have obstacles to overcome in order for this winter romance to blossom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Having been the mother of the bride twice and the mother of the groom once, it&amp;rsquo;s fun planning a virtual wedding. Then again, writing &lt;em&gt;A November Bride&lt;/em&gt; made me&amp;nbsp;responsible for every aspect of the wedding, including making sure the couple made it all the way to the &amp;lsquo;I do&amp;rsquo;s!&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Beth K. Vogt, author of &lt;em&gt;A November Bride&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
