Grayson Masters is focused on graduating the Apache helicopter course, and the last thing he needs is his gorgeous new roommate Samantha Fitzgerald distracting him. While her smart mouth and free spirit are irresistibly irritating, he can&#39;t deny their off-the-charts chemistry, no matter how hard he tries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having just been expelled from college, Sam has no business digging for Grayson&#39;s secrets while she&#39;s hiding her own, but that doesn&#39;t stop her from trying to tear down his walls. Each barrier she busts through drops one of her own, though, and she&#39;s not prepared for the truth: another woman laid claim to Grayson&#39;s heart long ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falling in love is something neither Grayson nor Sam can afford, and when that line is crossed and secrets are exposed, they&#39;ll learn that sometimes it&#39;s the answered prayers that will put you through hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Series order:&lt;br&gt;Flight &amp; Glory Book 1: Full Measures&lt;br&gt;Flight &amp; Glory Book 2: Eyes Turned Skyward&lt;br&gt;Flight &amp; Glory Book 3: Beyond What is Given&lt;br&gt;Flight &amp; Glory Book 4: Hallowed Ground&lt;/p&gt;" />
