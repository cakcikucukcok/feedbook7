  <title>Not Okay Cupid - Heidi R. Kling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;OMG the feels in this book. Probably one of my all time favorite books.&quot; &lt;b&gt;-Sam, Goodreads Reviewer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hazel McCallister loves her life. Perfect grades. Perfect best friend. Perfect boyfriend. Until her perfect boyfriend cheats on her with her perfect best friend. Now Hazel&#39;s in free fall--until her best friend&#39;s brother, Felix, gives her the perfect idea. Reclaim her power by taking revenge on her cheating ex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Felix James loves his life. Casual relationships. Loads of surfing. He&#39;s as drama-free as they come. But he can&#39;t stand by when his sister steals her best friend&#39;s boyfriend, and the dude insists it was Hazel&#39;s fault. So Felix vows to help turn Hazel into a girl her ex can&#39;t resist--so then she can break his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With an alliance in place, Hazel&#39;s revenge is all but assured. But with each piece of payback, she feels a stronger attraction to Felix, even though revenge will turn her into a girl Felix could never be with. And soon Hazel has to make an impossible choice: revenge...or Felix, the boy who&#39;s stolen her heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains betrayal, revenge, and that most tempting vice of all, the bad boy you know you can&#39;t have.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
