  <title>The Awakening (The Graveyard Queen, Book 7) - Amanda Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Shush…lest she awaken…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My name is Amelia Gray, and I&#39;m a cemetery restorer who lives with the dead. An anonymous donor has hired me to restore Woodbine Cemetery, a place where the rich and powerful bury their secrets. Forty years ago, a child disappeared without a trace and now her ghost has awakened, demanding that I find out the truth about her death. Only I know that she was murdered. Only I can bring her killer to justice. But the clues that I follow–a haunting melody and an unnamed baby&#39;s grave–lead me to a series of disturbing suspects.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For generations, The Devlins have been members of Charleston&#39;s elite. John Devlin once turned his back on the traditions and expectations that came with his birthright, but now he has seemingly accepted his rightful place. His family&#39;s secrets make him a questionable ally. When my investigation brings me to the gates of his family&#39;s palatial home, I have to wonder if he is about to become my mortal enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
