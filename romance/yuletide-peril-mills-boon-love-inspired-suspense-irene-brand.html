  <title>Yuletide Peril (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired Suspense) - Irene Brand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;When Janice Reid and her younger sister, Brooke, moved into their ancestral home, threatening letters and ominous phone calls made it obvious they were not welcome in Stanton, West Virginia. But Janice had always dreamed of providing a stable, safe home for Brooke, and she was determined to stay, no matter who wanted them out.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For the first time, Lance Gordon, Brooke&#39;s principal, was worried about someone outside his small world–a beautiful woman and her little sister. He was afraid the &quot;pranks&quot; would escalate–and Janice would get hurt. Lance was determined to discover the source of the trouble, no matter what the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
