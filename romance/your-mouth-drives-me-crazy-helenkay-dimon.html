Looking at six feet of hard, Hawaiian muscle and gorgeous cool that&#39;s making forgotten parts of her say, &quot;Aloha!,&quot; Annie needs to stay focused. But a side dish of Kane Travers is awfully tempting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      Kauai Police Chief Kane Travers is not a vacation kind of guy. So it figures that when Internal Affairs suspended him, he&#39;d end up rescuing a sarcastic, dishonest, extremely hot redhead who is clearly hiding something. Kane&#39;s got half a mind to give Miss Whoever She Is something she&#39;ll never forget, even if his cop senses tell him she needs his protection. But how can he get her to tell him anything when his mouth won&#39;t stop covering hers?" />
