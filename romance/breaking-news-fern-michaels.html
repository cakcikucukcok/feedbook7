  <title>Breaking News - Fern Michaels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Life Is Full Of Surprises&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teresa &quot;Toots&quot; Amelia Loudenberry has her quirks, but no one--especially not her trusted friends Sophia, Ida, and Mavis--would ever question her loyalty. So it&#39;s no surprise when Toots decides to extend her stay in Charleston to help care for her ailing housekeeper. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though the Charleston air is drenched with azalea and honeysuckle, and there&#39;s always a pitcher of sweet tea close to hand, the ladies have little time for relaxing. Ida&#39;s new line of cosmetics is about to launch, and Toots, Mavis, and Sophia are relishing new careers as models. And Abby, Toots&#39;s daughter, is getting hitched. In the middle of so much change, Toots is almost too busy to notice her own unexpected romance. After eight husbands, she&#39;s sworn never to get involved again. But fate--and her friends--may have other plans. And every godmother, fairy or otherwise, loves a story that ends with happily-ever-after.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Fern Michaels and The Godmothers Series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Whoever thought the &#39;golden years&#39; were boring never met the Godmothers.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;RT Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Pure recession-proof fun.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;" />
