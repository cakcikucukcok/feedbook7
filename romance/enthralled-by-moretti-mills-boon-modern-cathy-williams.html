  <title>Enthralled by Moretti (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) - Cathy Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;‘You win, Alessandro.’&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Defeat leaves a bitter taste in lawyer Chase Evans’s mouth. She’s worked hard to put the mistakes of her past behind her, but it’s not in billionaire CEO Alessandro Moretti’s nature to forgive…or forget. And in this latest deal he holds all the cards.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite her lies, Alessandro wants the elusive Chase in his bed now more than ever – and he’s not above blackmail to get her there. But his punishing regime of red-hot revenge backfires as his increasing desire for Chase threatens his legendary self-control, and still Chase and her secrets seem just out of his reach…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘I can’t stop thinking about the hero, he’s enchanting! Wonderful writing.’ – Suni, 39, Wirral&lt;/p&gt;
