      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Decadence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;In   the steamy Bliss River Valley of South Africa, a colony of aristocratic   British citizens have given themselves over--body and soul--to a debauched   and dissolute lifestyle.

Under the pretext of setting up a polo club in Bliss River Valley,   Charles has put into motion a carefully conceived plan of revenge he has   nurtured for years.&amp;#160; And even Georgiana   Maitland, with her knowing eyes and boundless capacity for passion, can&#39;t   quench his thirst for vengeance .&amp;#160;   .&amp;#160;   .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Desire&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faced with Charles&#39;   blatant disregard, Georgiana uses every womanly weapon at her disposal to   disarm him. But when a shocking murder rocks the colony and Charles becomes   the prime suspect, he concocts a daring plot, taking her captive in order to   escape. It&#39;s only a matter of time before he discovers just how willing a   hostage Georgiana really is--and how close he is to surrendering to her   wanton touch ..&amp;#160; .&amp;#160; .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She&#39;s the hottest writer in the   industry. &lt;i&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/i&gt; calls her &quot;The Queen of   Erotic Romance,&quot; and &lt;i&gt;Affaire de Coeur&lt;/i&gt; hails her as   &quot;the divine mistress of sensual writing.&quot; She&#39;s &lt;b&gt;Thea   Devine,&lt;/b&gt; and she&#39;s the author of eighteen steamy historical romances   (all published by Zebra Books), four novellas, and featured in the   bestselling erotic romance anthologies, &lt;i&gt;Captivated,   Fascinated,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;All Through The Night.&lt;/i&gt; She also   writes contemporary romance and is a long-time freelance manuscript reader.
