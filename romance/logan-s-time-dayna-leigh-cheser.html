  <title>Logan’S Time - Dayna Leigh Cheser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Set in the wilds of the Scottish Highlands, this nineteenth-century historical romance looks at the life and loves of Logan, the Duke of Muileach, beginning when hes seven years old. Grandson of the old Duke, Logan hides in his mothers room to witness his brothers birth. Confused, he watches as his mother, Annella, abandons the newborn, flees to the South Tower, and then locks herself and her entourage inside. 
After eight self-sequestered years in the South Tower, Annella disappears, leaving a family with too many questions. Later, Logan and Daniel lose their beloved grandfather, followed too soon by their grandmother. 
Logan travels to England to attend school, where he meets Richard Grayson, the youngest son of an English duke. After graduation, a celebratory trip to Paris results in tragedy. Minuet, the love of Logans life, may be dead, while his best friend, Richard, leaves Paris without notice. 
Peadair, Logans father, then the duke, renounces his title and leaves Muileach to face an uncertain future in southern France with his long-missing wife, who despises him. Logan, at age twenty-five, becomes the Duke of Muileach. 
Believing Richard had betrayed him with Minuet, Logan needs to square things with his former friend. He learns Richard now lives in America. Setting sail to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, he arrives just in time to crash Richard and Janelles wedding. That same day, he meets and marries Rachel. 
Too long absent from his home, Logan returns to Muileach with his family to discover Seanna, a childhood friend (and sometimes lover), has birthed his firstborn son. Later, Seanna reveals her plans to make sure her son is the next duke.
