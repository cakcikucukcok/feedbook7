  <title>Noah And The Stork (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) - Penny McCusker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;This Stork Was Nine Years Late!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Noah Bryant returns home to Erskine, Montana, he&#39;s not anticipating a hero&#39;s welcome. After all, he abandoned the town–and his high school girlfriend–right after the prom and hasn&#39;t spoken to anyone there since. But the last person he expects to meet is his nine-year-old daughter, Jessie…a daughter he didn&#39;t know he had.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Noah returns, Janey realizes she never really stopped loving him. And he seems eager to be a part of Jessie&#39;s life, and hers. But Noah&#39;s back in Erskine for more than personal reasons; he has a business proposition that could seriously affect the whole town. And if there&#39;s anything Janey loves as much as her family, it&#39;s Erskine.&lt;/p&gt;
