  <title>Protecting His Assets - J.K. Coi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;CEO Steve Nolan is wealthy, successful, and in danger. Now, thanks to his business partner, he has a bodyguard--a rigid, controlled woman with a smoky voice that invites steamy thoughts of rumpled sheets and oh-so-satisfying sleepless nights.

Guys just as smooth, who didn&#39;t take her seriously, and who broke her heart. So she&#39;s just here to do her job and stay focused and professional. &lt;br&gt;Even if Steve Nolan isn&#39;t just another rich jerk. &lt;br&gt;Even if the sexual spark between them keeps getting hotter.&lt;br&gt;And even if protecting his business and his ass(ets) means April could lose her heart in the bargain...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Bad Boy Bosses series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* In Bed with the Competition&lt;br&gt;* Protecting His Assets&lt;br&gt;* Sleeping with the Opposition&lt;/p&gt;" />
