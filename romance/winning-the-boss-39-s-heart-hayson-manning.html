  <title>Winning the Boss&#39;s Heart - Hayson Manning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Winning the Boss&#39;s Heart by Hayson Manning&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mason Christian has twelve weeks to flip something old into something new for his Japanese client, and then he&#39;s getting the hell out of Footsteps Bay, New Zealand. Not even his temporary cook and secretary--the feisty, luscious Billie McLeod--will deter him. There&#39;s no denying she makes him feel alive. More alive than he&#39;s felt in three years...  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Billie has one dream: save enough money to go to college. That&#39;s why she&#39;s agreed to work for hard ass, all-business-no-pleasure Mason Christian--a man who has every intention of destroying through &quot;modernization&quot; the town&#39;s most cherished historical home. But before she can say see ya, she realizes she&#39;s signed the dotted line and is contractually bound for eighty-four days.  Working with male perfection every day is awesome with a capital A--as long as they can stick to a hands-off policy that gets harder every day...&lt;/p&gt;" />
