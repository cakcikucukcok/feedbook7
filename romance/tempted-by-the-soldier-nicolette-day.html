  <title>Tempted by the Soldier - Nicolette Day</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tempted by the Soldier (A Falling for You Novel) by Nicolette Day&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;When one touch isn&#39;t enough, why resist?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Road trips are supposed to be fun. Or, at least, full of hot sex. For photographer Lilly Grayson, the fifteen-hour drive to her friend&#39;s wedding with Nate Jennings will be &lt;i&gt;neither&lt;/i&gt;. Not that Nate isn&#39;t sexy--the man is six-foot-three-inches of mouth-watering Marine. But Lilly&#39;s been there, done that...and he walked away. Now it&#39;s time for a little payback. The kind that&#39;ll make a man desperate for a taste of what he can&#39;t have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Nate wants a taste--so badly that he can barely keep his hands on the wheel. But the scars and ghosts of his last tour still haunt him. He can&#39;t give into temptation, not this time. Lilly deserves a whole man--one who can love her the way she deserves to be loved, even if she doesn&#39;t believe it can happen. And that can&#39;t be Nate. Not when he&#39;s leaving again in two weeks, and this time, he&#39;s not sure he&#39;ll return...&lt;/p&gt;" />
