  <title>Just Pretending - Leah Rooper, Kate Rooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not easy being royal. Sixteen-year-old Evangeline wears her crown proudly, but between her duties and her overprotective big brother, the idea of romance is just a dream. But a chance encounter in Chicago changes all that.... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure, seventeen-year-old Tyler Evans loves playing hockey, but he&#39;s more concerned about providing for his dad and little sister. Then he meets Eva--and falls head-over-heels in love--and he has two more problems. One, she&#39;s his best friend&#39;s little sister. Two, she wears a crown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then Eva accidentally mistakes Tyler for a visiting prince, and for the first time, Tyler doesn&#39;t feel like a nobody. He knows he has to tell her the truth...but not yet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His plan? To keep up the royal charade as long as it takes to convince Eva he&#39;s the guy for her. Even if he&#39;s lying to everyone...including himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: May cause disillusionment. Those girls looking to find their Prince Charming might consider scouting out hockey rinks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Chicago Falcons series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Just One of the Boys&lt;br&gt;* Just One of the Royals&lt;br&gt;* Just Pretending&lt;/p&gt;" />
