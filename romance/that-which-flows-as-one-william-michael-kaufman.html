  <title>That Which Flows as One - William Michael Kaufman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THAT WHICH FLOWS AS ONE
A Struggle to Love 
Everybody wants to be loved; not everybody is. How many of us spend significant portions of our lives looking for the perfect relationship? How many agonize over the emptiness of our lonely lives? And still how many of those who do finally attain their dream partnerperhaps their soul matefind that the fruit of their relationship rots long before it ever matures? Why do so many of us seem to struggle to locate our ideal mate, and why do we feel incomplete when we dont?
You wont necessarily find all the answers to these questions in That Which Flows As One. But you will discover that the struggle can have roots that extend back even to the childhoods of ones parents. Max, the narrator of the story, discovered that. But his discovery only came after an even deeper realizationan awareness of the mystery of love itself. 
It may well be love at first sight for Max, but what part of his body responds and communicates that love? What is it from his past that prevents the fruit of his love from maturing? He does not dance solo. He partners with Sarath, a woman whose struggle to love is born of a mother whose own childhood was created in a broken and deformed mold. Guided by their respective pain rather than insight, they struggle to build a family they never knew as children. Max can see a house in his mind, and the completed project will surely follow. He can see a loving relationship in his mind, and what ensues is torment and strife. Sarath unwittingly carries out patterns of control she learned from her mother. Aloofness is her shield, and ridicule her weapon. 
Fortunately, our heroes have something their parents never did. A woman of rare wisdom, magic, power, and extraordinary depths of love, guides them toward the unfolding mystery of love. Whether she employs hypnosis, or actually takes them on a journey back in time, Max and Sarath finally wake up to the mystery of love and relationship." />
