        &lt;p&gt;Someone was stalking million-dollar cover girl Allie Fortune–and ex-mercenary Rafe Stone had been hired to protect her. To keep her safe, he spirited Allie away to a secluded spot, telling himself to just do his job and not be seduced by her beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Rafe soon discovered that guarding Allie was far more dangerous than he&#39;d anticipated. Because it wasn&#39;t solely his existence that was threatened.
