  <title>Home on the Ranch (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - Allison Leigh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;SIX FOOT-PLUS OF RUGGED, &lt;em&gt;UNSMILING&lt;/em&gt; MALE STOOD THERE…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cage Buchanan hated her. The proud rancher might have hired Belle Day out of sheer desperation, but she was determined to help heal his injured daughter. Now here she was, installed at the Lazy-B Ranch, trying not to respond to this ornery, overbearing, incredibly arousing man.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cage was at the end of his rope. What else explained inviting a Day to live under the same roof? His daughter, Lucy, was Cage&#39;s first priority, but with her sexy therapist around, it was hard to focus on daily chores. What would it take to turn passionate enemies into lovers for life…and, together, make a real home on the ranch?&lt;/p&gt;
