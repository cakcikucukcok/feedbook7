      <meta name="description" content="During 1981, in Poland, Stefan Deblin, a junior engineer and Daniel Barski, a scientist, are training on the Riva Wisla as members of a rowing club when they are introduced to Alice Hansen, an attractive literature student from the United States, by Ziggy, the ex-president of the rowing club who is famous for his obnoxious personality and opportunistic attitude.&lt;p&gt;
Stefan is immediately attracted to Alice and she is intrigued by Stefan, but he has a girlfriend and Alice must face a past event before she can move forward with any man. Just when they begin to overcome their emotional barriers, Stefan has the opportunity to see the world and leaves to work on projects in Africa and Afghanistan.
