          &lt;em&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;The Boss’s Proposal&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gorgeous, tycoon Hugh Montcrieff might be the office heartthrob, but he does not date employees! Until he needs a fake date for an event, and decides his quirky new graphic designer Bella Faraday is the perfect candidate. But is Bella really the unsuitable girlfriend she’s supposed to be playing…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Smart, efficient Liz Hart loves her job as PA to millionaire businessman Cole Pierson. But when a makeover leads him to see her in a different light, he asks for her help outside the office. But when their professional relationship becomes personal can a fling beyond the boardroom become something more permanent?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Greek tycoon Alekos Gionakis thought he knew the value of his secretary, but her newly transformed appearance has him reappraising his employee! She needs help and Alekos offers to assist her if she agrees to become his mistress! But his plans are about to go awry, because her innocence is the one thing this powerful tycoon is about to realise is priceless.&lt;/p&gt;
