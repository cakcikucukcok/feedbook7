        &lt;p&gt;Skye Titan&#39;s wealthy father thinks he can &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; dictate his daughter&#39;s choice in men. Now widowed and a single mother, Skye isn&#39;t the yes-girl she once was.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Especially since the love of her life is back in Texas after eight long years. He won&#39;t like the answers to the questions he&#39;s asking. About why she left him at the altar. And about her eight-year-old daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Former Navy SEAL Mitch Cassidy comes home to find nearly everything different. His wounds from battle have changed the way people treat him. His cattle ranch is suddenly organic. But time hasn&#39;t touched his desire for Skye–or the sting of her betrayal. Forget lip service. He&#39;s asking that luscious mouth of hers to reveal &lt;em&gt;the truth&lt;/em&gt;. But will Mitch be able to put the past aside to help Skye get out from under her father&#39;s thumb…and help himself recover from a broken heart?&lt;/p&gt;
