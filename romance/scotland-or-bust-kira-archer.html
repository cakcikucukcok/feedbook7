  <title>Scotland or Bust - Kira Archer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After dumping her boyfriend, Nicole Franklin impulsively jumps on a plane and heads to Europe. Sure, money and a job would have been nice to line up first. Even a visa, for that matter. So now she has to play tour guide at an Outlander experience for the most obnoxious man on the planet. Until she stumbles into the wrong bed in the middle of the night and wakes up in Harrison&#39;s arms. Now his family thinks they&#39;re engaged, and the entire village is betting on how long before she&#39;ll be running for the hills. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harrison Troy has a reputation in the town for burning through assistants. And the bubbly new one he&#39;s just hired is likely no different. But his family quickly has them &quot;engaged.&quot; He should be upset, but she&#39;s the perfect buffer for his interfering family. She says she doesn&#39;t need another man in her life--even if he comes with a castle--and that&#39;s fine with him. So why can&#39;t he stop thinking about the woman who is charming everyone in the town, and maybe even him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each title in the Winning the Billionaire series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* 69 Million Things I Hate About You&lt;br&gt;* The Billionaire&#39;s Unexpected Baby&lt;br&gt;* Scotland or Bust&lt;/p&gt;" />
