  <title>Shift Out of Luck - Abigail Owen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Montagues and Capulets have nothing on the Canis and Banes wolf packs. The two have been feuding for ages. The brutal murder of the Banes&#39; alpha only added fuel to the fire. And now there&#39;s only one way to bring peace--the current alphas of each pack, Marrok and Tala, need a mating of convenience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tala has her doubts. A thousand of them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Never mind that Marrok drives her body to levels of desire her vibrator has trouble keeping up with. If she can&#39;t get her inner wolf--or her people--on board, forget peace, because she&#39;ll lose the tenuous control she has over the Canis pack. Her new mate is just so damn &lt;i&gt;alpha&lt;/i&gt;. He&#39;d better learn to play nice or Tala will have to show him who&#39;s boss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Marrok has plans of his own, and nothing and no one, not even Tala herself, can resist an alpha...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;This novella was previously self published as &lt;/i&gt;The Worse for Were&lt;i&gt; but has undergone a complete re-edit. Scenes were added, things were changed, but the kissing still remains!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Brimstone, Inc. series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* The Demigod Complex&lt;br&gt;* Shift Out of Luck&lt;br&gt;* Bait N&#39; Witch&lt;/p&gt;" />
