  <title>Moonlight (The Moon Series) - Lisa Kessler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rancher Adam Sloan is more than meets the eye. As the heir to his Pack, the sexy werewolf&#39;s biggest challenge is keeping his kin&#39;s true nature under wraps. But a group of jaguar shifters threatens to reveal the pack, blasting into town killing humans in plain sight. And when he smells one at the local diner, his standing orders are to take her out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lana Turpin doesn&#39;t realize she&#39;s a moving target. Raised in the foster system, she only knows that she blacks out during the new moon and wakes up without remembering a thing. But now she&#39;s being tracked by some strange organization that wants her back--even though she&#39;s never stepped foot inside their compound. And the stranger across the diner is watching her like an enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It should be a simple mission for Adam, but when he touches the frustratingly beautiful Lana, his inner wolf howls...&lt;i&gt;mate&lt;/i&gt;. Now, the two must find and stop the people who hunt her...and Adam must keep his own family from killing the only woman he will ever love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Moon series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Moonlight&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Hunter&#39;s Moon&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Blood Moon&lt;br&gt;Book #4 Harvest Moon&lt;br&gt;Book #5 Ice Moon&lt;br&gt;Book #6 Blue Moon&lt;br&gt;Book #7 Wolf Moon&lt;br&gt;Book #8 New Moon&lt;/p&gt;" />
