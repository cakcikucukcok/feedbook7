When Serena discovers that her former lover Zachary North is in trouble overseas, she&#39;s forced to leave the safety of her new life, and head back to a place she was trying to escape...and her life will never be the same again. As she brings Zac back to health in Venice, she discovers a shocking secret in the archives of her late father&#39;s work.  It is a secret that will propel her back to war-torn Libya, risking her life looking for clues that she hopes will piece together the mystery surrounding her parents&#39; marriage and the part of their life together that she never knew. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-kept secrets, passionate love, obsession, betrayal, redemption, and the power of the past to control the future propel &lt;i&gt;Secrets from the Past&lt;/i&gt;, the explosive new novel from &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Barbara Taylor Bradford&lt;/p&gt;" />
