  <title>The Revenge Game - Alice Gaines</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adam Morrow is a self-made millionaire. But one night with her could ruin everything...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve worked my ass off for what I have, and I&#39;m damn proud of it. I started off with nothing and now I&#39;m filthy rich. Let me tell you, there&#39;s nothing like revenge to help you get your ass in gear. And that&#39;s what I&#39;m taking, with every exclusive resort I open--sweet, sweet revenge...on her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nicole Westmore was my first love. The poor little rich girl stole my heart with her sweet smile, hot body, and irresistible innocence. The summer I worked for her father was the best time of my life...until he drove me away. Even then, I thought Nicole would wait for me. She didn&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so, I decided to get even, opening rival hotels, slowly driving them out of business. The old man is gone now, but Nicole is still running the company that&#39;s about to collapse. All my hard work will soon pay off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then I catch sight of her at a wedding, and all those feelings come rushing back--for both of us. Still, she doesn&#39;t know what I&#39;ve done--yet--and she seems more than willing. What will one night in her bed hurt?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sex is hotter than ever, and I can&#39;t help wondering if I&#39;ve made a mistake. Until I get up the next morning...and realize I&#39;ve been kidnapped!&lt;/p&gt;" />
