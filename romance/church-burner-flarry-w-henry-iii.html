  <title>Church Burner - Flarry W. Henry Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the small, peaceful community of Mariah, North Carolina, hell is about to break loose. One night, the towns oldest church is mysteriously burned to the ground. All thats left from the blaze is the churchs aged altar, the cross bent over as if in prayer due to the extreme heat. The towns sheriff, Angela Solomon, is called to investigate.
Unfortunately, no clues are found. The arson squad cant identify the cause or origin of the fire, which leaves Solomon with nothing to go on. Soon, though, other churches burn. What seemed like a random hate crime is taking over all of Mariah, and Solomon is at a loss. How can she possibly catch a criminal whos invisible?
The closer Solomon gets to the case, the more she begins to realize there is more at work in her small town than arson. She suspects something divine is involvedor perhaps, something demonic. Solomon and the rest of the townspeople must fight for their lives, their very souls, against an evil force that would heartlessly burn more than just buildings." />
