  <title>The Duke&#39;s Guide to Correct Behavior - Megan Frampton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of London knows the Duke of Rutherford has position and wealth. They also whisper that he&amp;#8217;s dissolute, devilish, and determinedly unwed. So why, everyone is asking, has he hired a governess?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Miss Lily Russell crosses the threshold of the Duke of Rutherford&amp;#8217;s stylish townhouse, she knows she has come face to face with sensual danger. For this is no doting papa. Rather, his behavior is scandalous, and his reputation rightly earned. And his pursuit of her is nearly irresistible&amp;#8212;but resist she must for the sake of her pupil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the duke himself, it was bad enough when his unknown child landed on his doorstep. Now Lily, with her unassuming beauty, has aroused his most wicked fantasies&amp;#8212;and, shockingly, his desire to change his wanton ways. He&amp;#8217;s determined to become worthy of her, and so he asks for her help in correcting his behavior.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lily has a secret, one that, if it becomes known, could change everything&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;" />
