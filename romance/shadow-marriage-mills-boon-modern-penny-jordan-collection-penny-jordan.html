          &lt;strong&gt;Penny Jordan needs no introduction as arguably the most recognisable name writing for Mills &amp; Boon. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection, many of which for the first time in eBook format and all available right now.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without trust, love cannot survive…&lt;/strong&gt; Sarah learned the bitter truth of those words when she discovered her brand-new marriage to Benedict de l&#39;Isle was a joke, the result of a foolish masculine bet between Ben and his friend Dale. In anger, Sarah let Ben think Dale had been her lover, and walked away forever or so she thought.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But three years later, Sarah found herself working with Ben again, and he was not at all prepared to put the bitterness of their past behind them. He was convinced that it was Sarah whose actions had destroyed their marriage, not his, and he was determined to punish her!&lt;/p&gt;

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Shadow Marriage (Mills &amp;amp; Boon Modern) (Penny Jordan Collection) - Penny Jordan</i></b> | After reading a serialized Mills &amp; Boon book in a magazine, Penny Jordan quickly became an avid fan! Her goal, when writing romance fiction, is to provide readers with an enjoyment and involvement similar to that she experienced from her early reading - Penny believes in the importance of love, including the benefits and happiness it brings.<br /><b><i>Shadow Marriage - Kindle edition by Jordan, Penny ...</i></b> | This seems to be Penny Jordan's cautionary tale to lovers to communicate. Sam, the "hero", is a weak-spined character who inadvertently destroys his marriage by withholding crucial information about himself from his new wife, Abbie. That bad decision then leads him to a false conclusion about her, and they divorce.<br /><b><i>Marriage Make Up by Penny Jordan - Goodreads</i></b> | Penny Jordan is an award-winning New York Times and Sunday Times bestselling author of more than 200 books with sales of over 100 million copies. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection of her novels, many of which are available for the first time in eBook right now.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Shadow Marriage (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) (Penny Jordan Collection) - Penny Jordan</a> </h3></p><hr/>
