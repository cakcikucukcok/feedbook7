Oh, right, her family hates him, and he&#39;s done terrible things. Or has he? But it doesn&#39;t matter. When he finds out the truth about who she really is...he&#39;ll never want to see her again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Things to do Before You Die series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 His Fantasy Girl&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Her Fantasy Husband&lt;br&gt;Book #3 His Fantasy Bride&lt;/p&gt;" />
