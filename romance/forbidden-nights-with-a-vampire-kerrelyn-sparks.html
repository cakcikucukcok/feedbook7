But after three former employees filed a complaint about her temper, Vanda is sentenced to an anger management class. Worse, Phil Jones agreed to be her sponsor. Phil, the mortal who is forbidden to her . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Vanda knew who&amp;#8212;or what&amp;#8212;Phil really is, she&#39;d reconsider her attraction to him, for his true nature is wilder than anything she&#39;d ever imagined. He has tackled the beast within and now is the perfect person to help Vanda with her rage . . . if only he can keep his cool when she makes him so undeniably hot. But with rogue vamps on the loose, will they ever have their forbidden nights?&lt;/p&gt;" />
