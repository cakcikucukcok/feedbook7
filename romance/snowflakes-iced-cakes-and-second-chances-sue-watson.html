      <meta name="description" content="&amp;#x2018;A heart-melting and &lt;b&gt;laugh-out-loud&lt;/b&gt; read that you do not want to miss ... will have you &lt;b&gt;hooked from start to end&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;#x2019; &lt;i&gt;By The Letter Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Escape to the cosy little village of Appledore for an absolutely hilarious second chance at love. Will this Christmas prove that miracles really can happen when you least expect them?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year after she separated from her husband, Gianni, on Christmas day, &lt;b&gt;Chloe&amp;#x2019;s&lt;/b&gt; heart is finally on the mend as she unpacks the decorations for her first ever festive holiday alone. That is, until the phone rings&amp;#x2026;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#x2019;s the manager of Gianni&amp;#x2019;s new seaside restaurant in Appledore, begging for Chloe&amp;#x2019;s help. Equally famous for his gold-leaf Christmas puddings and his explosive temper, Gianni has been really stirring up a sensation with the locals &amp;#x2013; and &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; in a good way! It&amp;#x2019;s the last thing she wants to do, but Chloe knows she is the only one that can help.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As pans fly and the temperature in the kitchen rises, Chloe&amp;#x2019;s calming influence and magic touch might just get critics back on side in time to save the restaurant from sinking like a sad souffl&amp;#xe9;. &lt;b&gt;But as Chloe&amp;#x2019;s eyes meet Gianni&amp;#x2019;s as they tussle over a plate of turkey tartlets, could there also be a chance for new romance on the menu?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A laugh-out-loud festive treat that will give you the tingle of freshly hung tinsel. Perfect for fans of Jenny Colgan, Abby Clements and Debbie Johnson.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What readers are saying about &lt;i&gt;Snowflakes, Iced Cakes and Second Chances&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;&lt;b&gt;Love, Love, Loved it.
