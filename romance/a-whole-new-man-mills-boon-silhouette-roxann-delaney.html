        &lt;p&gt;Hank Davis had spent his whole life going from place to place, never putting down roots. So he knew the move to Kansas City was only temporary.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then he met image consultant Lizzie Edwards. In two short weeks she was able to transform his rugged blue-collar appearance into manager material. Still, it was her charming personality and farm-fresh looks, not to mention her precocious four-year-old daughter, that truly captured his heart. Problem was, promising Lizzie a future wasn&#39;t something this live-for-the-moment man knew how to do. But when an incredible gift left him with an unexpected legacy, would Hank allow this little family into his life, and finally find a place to call home…?&lt;/p&gt;
