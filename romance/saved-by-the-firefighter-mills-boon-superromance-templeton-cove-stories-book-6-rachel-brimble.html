          &lt;strong&gt;How can she forgive him for what he didn&#39;t do?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Photographer Izzy Cooper feels as frozen as her pictures. Trent Palmer might be the hottest firefighter in Templeton Cove, but she can never face him again. Not after he failed to save her brother. But when they&#39;re forced together by a calendar shoot, the sparks between them are undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Izzy knows it&#39;s not fair to blame Trent for the tragedy, but opening herself up to loss again isn&#39;t something she&#39;s prepared to do, no matter how determined Trent is to show her that pain is part of life and that love—their love—can make any suffering bearable.&lt;/p&gt;
