  <title>New Year Escapes: A Mistake, A Prince and A Pregnancy / Hired by Her Husband / Captured and Crowned / Waking Up to You / No Strings... / Midnight Special (Mills &amp; Boon e-Book Collections) - Maisey Yates, Anne McAllister, Janette Kenny, Leslie Kelly...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Prepare to be swept away by these six fantastic novels packed with exotic locations and desirable heroes from six reader favourite Mills &amp; Boon Modern and Blaze authors!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Give into temptation…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A Mistake, a Prince and a Pregnancy by Maisey Yates&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An IVF clinic mix-up meant Alison was pregnant with Maximo Rossi, Prince of Turan’s heir! And his royal proposal was a command, not a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hired by her Husband by Anne McAllister&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;George Savas never thought he would ever need his ex-wife Sophy…until he was critically injured. He is sure she won’t come willingly, so he hires her to be his wife again!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Captured and Crowned by Janette Kenny&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A year ago Prince Kristo Stanrakis and emetria nearly made love on sun-baked sand. Now Kristo must take his place as King of Angyra — with Demetria as his queen, so they can finish what they started…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Waking Up to You by Leslie Kelly&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hollywood costume designer Candace Reid would do anything for her gay best friend — even marry him! But before she says ‘I do’, she heads to Napa for one last fling…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No Strings… by Janelle Denison&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ad exec Chloe Reiss always lived by the rules, until she went to the Caribbean on business with gorgeous Aiden Landry… Their company’s ‘no fraternising’ rule was made to be broken!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Midnight Special by Tawny Weber&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;FBI special agent Hunter was en route to testify as a key witness when he woke up with a hot blonde in his arms. But is Marni just having fun…or taking Hunter for a ride?&lt;/p&gt;
