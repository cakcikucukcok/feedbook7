Years of failed fertility treatments, a cheating husband and an oppressive family have pushed her to the limits. At the end of her tether, she runs away to the one place she thinks she can find solace: her childhood home in the Highlands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There, as she struggles to mend her broken life, she reconnects with her childhood friend Jamie McAnena, who is trying to raise his daughter Masie alone.
