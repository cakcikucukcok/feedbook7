  <title>Here and Now - Cheryl Etchison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rangers of the 1st/75th fight hard, train hard and play hard. They are physically strong and mentally tough, disciplined and courageous. But all their military training hasn&#39;t prepared them for falling in love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Ranger Medic Lucky James feels right at home working long night shifts in the ER, but less so during the day, when his college classes are filled with flirtatious co-eds. When his 19-year-old chem lab partner shows up at his work with dinner for &amp;#8220;her Lucky,&amp;#8221; he quickly enlists the help of Rachel Dellinger, a nurse and fellow third shift vampire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rachel is a people pleaser at heart, but she&amp;#8217;s finally decided enough is enough when it comes to her on-again, off-again boyfriend. When Lucky begs Rachel to help him ward off the advances of his teenager pursuer, she blackmails him into helping move her things out of the apartment she shared with her ex into a place all her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there a friendship is born between two people just trying to make it through the night. Neither are living in the past or planning for the future. Until one day changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;" />
