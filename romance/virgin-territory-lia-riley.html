  <title>Virgin Territory - Lia Riley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Practice Makes Perfect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick &amp;#8220;Patch&amp;#8221; Donnelly has what it takes to be the best goalie in the NHL&amp;#8230;if only he could learn to control his temper. When Coach orders him to get his head in the game with private yoga classes, Patch isn&amp;#8217;t having it. There&amp;#8217;s no way this tough Boston guy would be caught dead downward dog-ing his way to inner peace. But if he refuses, he risks his starting position and the dream he sacrificed everything for, including joining the priesthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoga instructor Margot Kowalski is over men. After yet another toxic relationship, she&amp;#8217;s eager to forget love and focus on growing her business. Doing the Hellions head coach a favor by helping out a troubled player can&#39;t hurt, and it might give her career a high-profile boost. But free-spirited Margot is soon charming the pants off Patch. Literally. Her sassy combination of sweet and sexy proves irresistible to the goalie. Before Patch can give into temptation though, he&amp;#8217;ll have to confess his biggest secret:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#8217;s a virgin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Patch is hiding more than sexual inexperience, and his dark past soon threatens to destroy his shot at true love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
