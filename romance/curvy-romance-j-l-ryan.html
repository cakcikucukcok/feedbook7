  <title>Curvy Romance - J.l. Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A short and sexy curvy girl romance about a plus-size pediatrician and the sexy single dad who&amp;#39;s obsessed with her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Curvy pediatrician Jennifer has no time for romance until a bad boy college friend shows up unexpectedly. Their best friend is getting married and has invited them both to the wedding, so they decided to be each other&amp;#39;s date.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sexy single dad Lorenzo hasn&amp;#39;t seen Jennifer in years, and when he lays his eyes on this stunning BBW, he almost loses it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the chairman of the hospital&amp;#39;s pediatrics department tries to jeopardize Jennifer and Lorenzo&amp;#39;s new relationship, it threatens to rock them all to the core.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hot Lorenzo is hiding something from Jennifer that causes him to pull away from their relationship, but he&amp;#39;s so captivated by her delicious curves, that he finds himself almost obsessed. Could his heart-pounding secret be the glue that holds them together or might it be the end of the line for both of them?&lt;br /&gt;
