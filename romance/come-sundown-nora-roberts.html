  <title>Come Sundown - Nora Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Come Sundown &lt;/i&gt;named as one of Whoopi Goldberg&#39;s &quot;Favorite Summer Reads&quot; on ABC&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The View&lt;/i&gt; and one of &lt;i&gt;NY Post&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s biggest blockbuster &quot;Whizbang Books&quot; of the summer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A novel of suspense, family ties, and twisted passions from the #1 &lt;/i&gt;New York Times&lt;i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;/i&gt;The Obsession&lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodine ranch and resort in western Montana is a family business, an idyllic spot for vacationers. A little over thirty thousand acres and home to four generations, it&#39;s kept running by Bodine Longbow with the help of a large staff, including new hire Callen Skinner. There was another member of the family once: Bodine&#39;s aunt, Alice, who ran off before Bodine was born. She never returned, and the Longbows don&#39;t talk about her much. The younger ones, who never met her, quietly presume she&#39;s dead. But she isn&#39;t. She is not far away, part of a new family, one she never chose--and her mind has been shattered...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a bartender leaves the resort late one night, and Bo and Cal discover her battered body in the snow, it&#39;s the first sign that danger lurks in the mountains that surround them. The police suspect Cal, but Bo finds herself trusting him--and turning to him as another woman is murdered and the Longbows are stunned by Alice&#39;s sudden reappearance. The twisted story she has to tell about the past--and the threat that follows in her wake--will test the bonds of this strong family, and thrust Bodine into a darkness she could never have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;" />
