  <title>Our Broken Bond - Marlene F Cheng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this warm and engaging sequel to&lt;em&gt; Our Precious Bond&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;accomplished author Marlene F. Cheng closely follows the life stories of three characters who are as unique as their names: Raven, Oriole and Tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raven is the now-grown son of Geneva, &lt;/strong&gt;from the first book, and his NHL hockey star father, known only as &amp;ldquo;Y.&amp;rdquo; He turns one day from a PhD path and impulsively joins the Canadian army, eventually becoming a superior sniper. And even though his parents are nonplussed at his new life choice, he never looks back through two harrowing tours of duty in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oriole is a downtrodden refugee camp survivor&lt;/strong&gt; who miraculously emigrates to America one day, sponsored by, of all organizations, a college fraterity. There, he finds new brothers to replace the family that was brutally gunned down so many years before by rebels, when he was a child in his native Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Tree? She is the U.N. relief worker &lt;/strong&gt;who discovers Oriole in the dusty back byways of the refugee camp, aids in his emigration, and finally follows him to Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is an epic saga&lt;/strong&gt; filled with endearing characters and lyrical writing. About Raven&amp;rsquo;s skills as a sniper, the author says he is &amp;ldquo;as fast as a flitting firefly, as silent as falling snow.&amp;rdquo; And Raven&amp;rsquo;s mother, in a wistful moment, describes her ache for the relationship that ended when Y returned to Sweden to be with his original family:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;When I watch the moonshine on the water, &lt;/strong&gt;a nostalgic longing comes over me ... a strong yearning that moves me to tears.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five-plus stars to &lt;em&gt;Our Broken Bond.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Like its predecessor, it is rich with complex characterizations and compelling narrative that puts the reader squarely in the middle of a sweeping tale of duty, honor, love, compassion and hope. -- &lt;em&gt;Publishers Daily Reviews&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
