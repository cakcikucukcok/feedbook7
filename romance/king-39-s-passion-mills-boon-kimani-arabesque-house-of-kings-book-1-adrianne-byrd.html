  <title>King&#39;s Passion (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani Arabesque) (House of Kings, Book 1) - Adrianne Byrd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The sexy King brothers own a successful bachelor-party-planning business and a string of upscale clubs across the country. What could be better than living the single life in some of the world&#39;s most glamorous cities?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finding a woman worth giving it up for…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Eamon King organizes the wildest bachelor parties in Las Vegas. So wild that his latest client ends up marrying one of the strippers. Now the jilted bride-to-be, Victoria Gregory, is suing his company for millions. The problem is Eamon has never been so turned on by anyone as he is by the beautiful, voluptuous and very angry Victoria. He&#39;s sure that all he has to do to charm his way out of the lawsuit is to charm his way into her bed. Win-win, right? Wrong. Because every white-hot moment they&#39;re together makes him realize he&#39;s found the only woman who can make him lose his heart….&lt;/p&gt;
