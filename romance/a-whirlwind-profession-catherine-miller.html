  <title>A Whirlwind Profession - Catherine Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Tina&#39;s whirlwind profession as a fashion designer spirals upward in NYC, her exciting encounters, dangerous liaisons, and fundamental fashions lead her towards completing life&#39;s grand design of fame and fortune. But, with Michael doing the city&#39;s public relations work, Mary funnelling as secretary, Lauren&#39;s stormy marriage, and Dori&#39;s fashion disasters , some obstacles get in the way.  Magazine scandals, award-dinner fanfare, news-seeking photographers, and a video producer and his cabaret-dancer girlfriends are just around the corner to sabotage her career. Will Tina realize her dream of becoming an accomplished fashion designer, or will her reputation take a turn for the worst?&lt;p&gt;
&quot; The next few days  I worked diligently in my studio on vexing designs that were eccentric and somewhat provocative. Even designers have to move with the times and break tradition every now and then to keep new and refreshing styles unique for younger generations.&quot;&lt;p&gt;
&quot;I headed into my studio to finish shading in one of my sketches, with a smile on my face, fully aware that this was the start of something big. From my circle-top window, I could see the lights of the city. It was the exact view that lured me to this vicarious fashion center of the world. I was feeling thankful that I will never suffer from ennui in this career, in a beautiful place like this, and I slept like a baby.&quot;" />
