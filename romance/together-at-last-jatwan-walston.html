  <title>Together at Last - Jatwan Walston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lisa Johnson is a well-established defense lawyer. In ninety days, she will be evaluated for junior partner. She is the middle daughter out of three and is always expected to do the responsible thing in her mothers eyes. She has a ten-year-old son, Dante, who is the center of her universe. Lisa hasnt dated seriously in seven years. The last guy she dated broke her heart by dropping out of her life without any explanation. To put the icing on the cake, her sons father, Anthony, is still secretly in love with her. 
LeShaun Jackson is a brilliant neurosurgeon and stuck in a messy divorce. His soon to be ex-wife, Kiesha, is money hungry and conniving and finds it impossible to be monogamous and take care of Brittani, their six-year-old daughter. LeShaun has been nothing but faithful to his wife and pays all her expenses. He feels he deserves custody of Brittani. Life seems hopeless until he made a very important phone call. 
Lisa accepts the call from LeShaun, and they catch up on each others lives. Her heart sinks when she finds out LeShaun is married, yet she agrees to meet up with him after all these years. Sparks fly even though the variables in their lives are so twisted. Can their hot attraction stand LeShauns crazy ex or Lisas jealous ex? Will they ever be able to be together at last?" />
