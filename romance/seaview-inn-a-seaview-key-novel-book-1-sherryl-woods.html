  <title>Seaview Inn (A Seaview Key Novel, Book 1) - Sherryl Woods</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Hannah Matthews is undeniably tough—a single mom, a top-tier PR exec, a breast cancer survivor. She prides herself on being go-to Hannah, who can handle any crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But with her grandmother balking at going into a retirement home, her daughter unexpectedly pregnant and an old flame suddenly underfoot, Hannah is facing a few crises of her own. And being back home on Seaview Key is definitely adding to the stress.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Luke Stevens understands crisis. While serving in Iraq, his wife dumped him for his best friend—with whom Luke shares his medical practice. Seaview Key seems like the perfect place to hide out for a while. The last thing he expects is to fall in love…with his old hometown and with Hannah.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, though, the unexpected is just what it takes to heal the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
