It&amp;#39;s not just that she was bartered to Owen Duff like a piece of property to end a clan feud. She&amp;#39;s also haunted by premonitions of his death on their upcoming wedding day. Yet the exasperating Highlander won&amp;#39;t let her call it off, even though his life and his clan are both in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owen has wanted Maggie in his bed since he first glimpsed her years ago. If their union restores peace between their clans, so much the better. But while lusting after another chief&amp;#39;s sister had its risks, growing to trust Maggie is far more dangerous. Owen is falling deeply in love with the one woman he cannot hope to claim . . . and survive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
