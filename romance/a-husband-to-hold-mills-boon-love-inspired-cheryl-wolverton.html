          &lt;strong&gt;RUNNING AWAY&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She had caught everyone&#39;s eye. Petite, mysterious Leah Thomas was new to Hill Creek, Texas, and the entire town had taken notice. Especially one handsome cowboy, who&#39;d offered to give Leah some much-needed help.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Soon Mark Walker learned that the blond beauty wasn&#39;t as helpless as she appeared. But she had something hidden inside that she refused to reveal. And Mark was determined to find the key to her heart….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Leah was running from a past she couldn&#39;t forget. But to help her, Mark had to stop running, too. Only with God&#39;s help–and each other&#39;s–could they reach their paths of redemption and find a future together….&lt;/p&gt;
