  <title>Gamma Rift - Kalli Lanford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I may be a Prince, but there are things that trouble me about my father&#39;s royal rule-the forced abduction, experimentation, and torture of alien creatures. The king has a new prisoner who&#39;s a carefully kept secret...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a young female who belongs to a little-known civilization I have been studying extensively. They are human, belonging to a small, undeveloped planet called Earth. She is pretty in a way I find unusual and compelling. Sometimes I sneak into the adjoining cell and we talk about everything and nothing, even as I find myself yearning to touch her strange, soft skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skin that is being subjected to invasive tests and experiments. A body that&#39;s scheduled for a live dissection in fifteen days. And a life that will be terminated unless I risk my future and life to help her escape...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trans-Galactic Insurrection series is best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 - Gamma Rift&lt;br&gt;Book #2 - Starstruck&lt;/p&gt;" />
