  <title>The Girl on the Balcony - Frances Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Love at first sight does not exist.  Or so Matt Steele thinks, until he sees the girl on the balcony at the London premiere of his latest movie.
Desperate to get to know her without his fame getting in the way, the Hollywood star assumes the name of the character he is due to play in a forthcoming movie.  In this guise, he meets teacher Laura Marshall and they fall in love.  It seems Matt&#39;s plan has worked.
But Laura believes she is in love with an out of work actor called Jonathan Mann.  What will happen when she discovers their love is based on a lie?
More crucially, how will their fledgling romance survive when Matt has to return to the States without her?  Especially when, through acombination of misfortune, misunderstanding and the malice of a distinctly fishy character, it seems as though the parting will be permanent.
The narrative switches between London and the States as the protagonists learn from their mistakes.
Was their love just a holiday romance or does it mean so much more?" />
