  <title>No Other Duke But You - Valerie Bowman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bestselling author Valerie Bowman sets the stage in Regency England for her Playful Brides series, where couples&#39; misadventures on the way to the altar are witty, romantic romps based on some of the world&#39;s most beloved plays.

There&#39;s just one problem: he barely knows she exists. But no matter, she&#39;s got a plan to win him over with her charm, her wit--and perhaps the love potion she has in her possession wouldn&#39;t hurt her cause...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lord Thomas Hobbs&lt;/b&gt;, Duke of Huntley, thinks his best friend Delilah&#39;s quest to become a duchess is ridiculous. He&#39;s always said he&#39;d rather give up all the brandy in London than commit to one person for life. Besides, he knows that Delilah&#39;s love potion can&#39;t possibly win over Branville...since she accidentally gave it to &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; instead. But perhaps this is the excuse he needs to show her he&#39;s always loved her...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Delilah can&#39;t believe she gave the potion to the wrong duke. Then again, Delilah could do a lot worse than win the hand of her handsome best friend.
