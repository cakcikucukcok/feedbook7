  <title>Of Human Misery - Tammy Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Of Human Misery is for the most part, a romance, sprinkled with several love triangles, flavored by a few tabooed subjects and laced with the quest for undying passion that is yearned for in every life. The book revolves around one main heroine and the many struggles she faces in her lifetime. She is someone who desperately searches for happiness, however constant obstacles seem to always impede her path.
&lt;bR&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Like many of the greatest love stories throughout history, all legendary romances need tragedy and separation, heartache and pain, and of course love, to fully capture a readers attention. The lead character, Shanna Somers, seeks affection and acceptance above all else and strives to find it in everyone she meets.
&lt;bR&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This novel is set in many locales, from Nashville, Tennessee to New York City and Los Angeles. The character also ventures to Canada, The Orient, The Caribbean, Europe and Africa to make the story complete. Our saga envelopes all that is expected of a modern-day romance novel and produces a paramount of true love and a faithful love that challenges all time.
&lt;bR&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The story provides the most useful insights into the human conditionthe anguish of loneliness and the agonizing ecstacy of heartbreak. If nothing else can be said about this piece of work it would be that it is a rare, yet dignified passionate portrait of a woman and her many challenges. These are challenges which encompass grief, heartache and a willingness to survive that is incomparable.
&lt;bR&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I would like to introduce you to the first novel in a series&lt;i&gt;Of Human Misery.&lt;/i&gt;" />
