  <title>It Takes a Scandal - Caroline Linden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sometimes It Takes a Scandal . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail Weston has everything: beauty, wit, and one of the largest dowries in England.

But the money seems to blind every man she meets&amp;#8212;except one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sebastian Vane has nothing. He came home from war with a shattered leg to find his father mad and his inheritance gone. He&#39;s not a fit suitor for anyone, let alone an heiress. But Abigail lights up his world like a comet, bright and beautiful and able to see &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; instead of his ruined reputation. And it might end happily ever after . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Reveal Your Heart&#39;s Desire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . . Until Benedict Lennox begins courting Abigail. Ben is everything Sebastian isn&#39;t&amp;#8212;wealthy, charming, heir to an earl. Sebastian won&#39;t give up the only girl he&#39;s ever loved without a fight, but Abigail must choose between the penniless gentleman who moves her heart, and the suitor who is everything her parents want.&lt;/p&gt;" />
