Now, a little older and wiser, she&#39;s back to run her mother&#39;s cafe for the summer. Except something about this town has her itching to get a little reckless and rowdy, especially when she sees her old partner-in-crime, Brody Dawson. Their chemistry is just as hot as ever. But he&#39;s still the town&#39;s golden boy-and she&#39;s still the wrong kind of girl.&lt;br&gt;  Brody hasn&#39;t had much time lately for anything other than ranching. Running the biggest spread in the county and taking care of his family more than keeps him busy. All that responsibility has him longing for the carefree days of high school-and Lila. She may have grown up, but he still sees that spark of mischief in her eyes. Now he&#39;s dreaming about late-night skinny dipping and wondering how he can possibly resist the one woman he can never forget...&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Carolyn Brown makes the sun shine brighter and the tea taste sweeter.
