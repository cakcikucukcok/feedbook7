  <title>Crimson Heart (A Highland Hearts Novel) - Heather McCollum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Elena has spent her entire life hiding her family name while walking the thin line between lady and servant in a Protestant household. She has kept the secret of her lineage for years, but with a new, fiercely Catholic queen on the throne, Elena&#39;s Protestant caretaker is being targeted. And when Bloody Mary discovers Elena&#39;s true identity, she must flee to Scotland to save her life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highland warrior, Searc Munro, has secrets of his own. In a family of healers, his dark, killing magic must never be known. When his father&#39;s life is threatened, Searc unleashes his lethal power to save him. With his clan&#39;s suspicious glances and whispers plaguing him, he sets off alone, only to find another use for his magic in saving a beautiful lass being attacked in the forest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaming up as exiles, Elena and Searc head toward Edinburg to find refuge. Yet, with a series of ritual killings haunting the city and a traitor attempting to assassinate Scotland&#39;s regent, suspicion turns to Searc. As word of another British heir reaches the country, the two must learn to trust each other if they want to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Highland Hearts series can be read out of order, but is best enjoyed in order. &lt;br&gt;Highland Hearts reading order: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;#1 Captured Heart   &lt;br&gt;#2 Tangled Hearts&lt;br&gt;#3 Untamed Hearts      &lt;br&gt;#4 Crimson Heart     &lt;br&gt;#5 Highland Heart&lt;/p&gt;" />
