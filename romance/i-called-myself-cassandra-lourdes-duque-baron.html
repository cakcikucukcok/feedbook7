  <title>I Called Myself Cassandra - Lourdes Duque Baron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With his confession, I realized Robin was torn and left ripped apart by two lovers who demanded from him two completely different things. One wanted to start a new family, while the other wanted him to stick around for her aging, maturing, and now trifling self. Verna gave him a fresh opportunity, while the only thing I had to offer was to grow old together in our not-so golden years, which could very well become eclipsed by our darkest times apart. The promise I was willing to see through with him, no matter the bumps and bruises it has caused us, was companionship, continuing what we started ages ago. As young lovers, we once vowed to each other that our love would survive the test of time. However, Verna&amp;rsquo;s newer promise of a more youthful life seemed to be more riveting to him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
