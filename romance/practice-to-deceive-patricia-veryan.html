  <title>Practice To Deceive - Patricia Veryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 1746.  Bonnie Prince Charlie&#39;s rebellion has been crushed, and his loyal followers, bound to recover a vast missing treasure, flee murderous soldiers and bounty hunters across strife-torn England.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in the center of this violent storm, the lovely Penelope Montgomery lives a virtual prisoner of her scheming uncle and his cruel wife.  She knows nothing of their cold plot to make her innocence a gift to Captain Rolan Otton, whose startling handsomeness barely conceals a ruthless villainy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She dreams only of Quentin Chandler--the man who won her love in childhood, who now claims the awakening passions of her womanhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And soon destiny will surprise them both as they are reunited in a desperate flight to restore the missing treasure, bring honor back to England, and savor at last the sweet rewards of their longing, loving hearts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
