But nothing stuns her more than when she finds out that he has asked Dillon Montgomery to help her run the company. Her grandfather had fired Dillon and ordered him off the company property years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve years ago Samantha made her feelings known to Dillon and the whole thing ended in disaster and they haven&#39;t spoken since. Working together now, even all these years later, is sure to be a disaster. Still, she needs his help if she is going to keep Collins Industry afloat. But will the prodigal son return to the empire -- and the woman -- who desperately need him? Will he be able to admit how much he desperately needs her?&lt;/p&gt;" />
