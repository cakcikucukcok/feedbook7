  <title>Everlasting Essence - Ria Prestia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Even though shes had a loving husband, beautiful children, and a solid career, forty-one-year-old Gabriella Visconti-McHolland has never felt complete. Now, she has a life-altering decision to make. Bryan, her husband of twenty years, wants to move to Florida for an incredible job opportunity, but Gabby would rather stay in New York to pursue her own career. Besides, does she really love Bryan enough to completely uproot her life for him? &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To answer this haunting question, Gabriella embarks on a journey to discover the essence that dwells deep within her soul and to find the child in her that she thought was lost. After years of being the wife and mother, Gabriella must find the woman underneath those roles to unearth her true identity. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Gabriella questions the stability of her marriage. To find out if it can survive, Gabriella and Bryan take a romantic weekend getaway to try and revive a past she long thought dead. But will they rediscover the love that connected them so long agoor will they accept their differences and separate? &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;An emotionally gripping story, &lt;i&gt;Everlasting Essence&lt;/i&gt; captures one womans struggle to find her true identity while reconciling her past with her future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
