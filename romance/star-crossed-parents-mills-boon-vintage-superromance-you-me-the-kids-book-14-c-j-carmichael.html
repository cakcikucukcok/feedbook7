  <title>Star-Crossed Parents (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) (You, Me &amp; the Kids, Book 14) - C.J. Carmichael</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Few people can say they&#39;re starring in a real-life version of &lt;em&gt;Romeo and Juliet.&lt;/em&gt; And single mom Leigh certainly doesn&#39;t want to play the role of disapproving mother. But when her daughter runs off to New Hampshire for a boy she&#39;s met over the Internet, it&#39;s a discomfiting reminder of Leigh&#39;s own past….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The problem is Sam Wallace, the boy&#39;s father, and his ridiculous notion that love conquers all. Worse still is that Sam could be a pretty darn good (not to mention attractive) distraction for Leigh. But how can Leigh think about herself when her daughter is about to make the worst mistake of her life?&lt;/p&gt;
