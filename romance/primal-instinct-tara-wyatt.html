  <title>Primal Instinct - Tara Wyatt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ROCK YOU ALL NIGHT LONG&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  The first time he lays eyes on Taylor Ross in a bar, Colt Priestley does something few men would dare to do. He approaches the world-famous singer, shamelessly flirts with her, and gives her a night in his bed that neither of them will soon forget.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  When Taylor&#39;s record label hires a bodyguard to keep tabs on the out-of-control rocker, she&#39;s less than thrilled to find it&#39;s her off-the-charts one-night stand who shows up for the job. She&#39;s terrified of letting herself fall for the damaged ex-Army Ranger, and she&#39;s determined to push him away. Yet every moment they&#39;re together simmers with tension. As the danger from an obsessed stalker mounts, Taylor and Colt are tempted to cross that line again-baring their hearts and souls as well as their bodies-and there&#39;s no telling how hot this song will get." />
