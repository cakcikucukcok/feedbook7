        &lt;p&gt;Protecting Princess Victoria&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Under cover of darkness, Lance Grayson conducted the most crucial rescue mission of his career. And succeeded. Though dazed from her ordeal, the rightful Princess Victoria of Thortonburg was still breathtakingly beautiful…and spirited enough to question where her tall, dark savior was taking her. Alone.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;His safe house was humble, but would have to do. With her kidnappers still at large, it was Lance&#39;s duty to watch over Victoria Rockford…and to reveal the secret that would turn her life upside down. Not known for compassion, Lance couldn&#39;t resis comforting this woman. Yet he was honor-bound to resist making &lt;em&gt;Princess&lt;/em&gt; Victoria &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; in every war…&lt;/p&gt;
