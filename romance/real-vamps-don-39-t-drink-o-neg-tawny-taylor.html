  <title>Real Vamps Don&#39;t Drink O-neg - Tawny Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;First Love Or First Bite? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Although Sophie Hahn works as a paranormal researcher, she doesn&#39;t believe in ghosts, werewolves, or anything to do with the supernatural world. But when it appears that her best friend Dao is slowly being killed by a female vampire, her beliefs are put to the test. Dao&#39;s new wife is the prime suspect, though she doesn&#39;t look capable of hurting a fly, let alone sucking the life out of someone. On the other hand, watching Dao whither away to nothing isn&#39;t an option. So if Sophie has to go vampire hunting, she&#39;ll do it.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; They are the Others--the vampires, mages, and werewolves once thought to exist only in our imaginations. Now they&#39;re stepping out of the shadows, and nothing in our world will ever be the same again.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;In A Town Like This, Being A P.I. Can Be Murder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shiarra Waynest&#39;s detective work was dangerous enough when her client base was strictly mortal. But ailing finances have forced her to accept a lucrative case that could save her firm--if it doesn&#39;t kill her first. Shiarra has signed on to work for a high-level mage to recover an ancient artifact owned by one of New York&#39;s most powerful vampires.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;NEVER TEMPT FATE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s been a hell of a day for Abby Barlow. In just a few hours, she&#39;s survived an explosion, watched her employer die, had a startling dream, and now she finds herself in a seedy Chicago hotel with the sexy, unearthly Dante, a man she both desires and fears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For 341 years, Dante has stood as guardian to The Chalice, a mortal woman chosen to hold back the darkness. A terrible twist of fate has now made Abby that woman. Three hours ago, Dante would have used all his charms to seduce her. Now she is his to protect. And he will do so until his very death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drama. Scandal. Secrets. And a whole lot of supernatural goings-on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;I&#39;m Pureblood Were, And Proud Of It.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&quot;Where Darkness Lives&quot; by Alexandra Ivy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one&#39;s more surprised than Sophia when she&#39;s struck by an unfamiliar maternal urge to move near her daughters. But instead of being greeted by a welcome committee, she&#39;s targeted by kidnappers.  .  .and saddled with a gorgeous bodyguard on a mission to protect--and seduce.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;I&#39;m A Tomboy At Heart, But I Want A Man Who Makes Me Feel Like A Real Woman.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&quot;Murder on Mysteria Lane&quot; by Angie Fox&lt;/b&gt;" />
