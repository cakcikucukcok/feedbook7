  <title>Her Mistletoe Man (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Carolyn Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALL HE WANTED FOR CHRISTMAS…&lt;/strong&gt; was to get away from the hustle and bustle of another lonely holiday season. But when Tucker Maddock stopped at what he &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; was a quaint country inn, he found himself at a reunion of the big, boisterous Marsh family–who instantly welcomed their &quot;long-lost cousin&quot; with open arms….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was tempting to pretend, just for a little while, that this close, loving family was his own. But there was one small problem–a woman named Ruth Marsh. She was suspicious of him from the start–and so beautiful, he &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; didn&#39;t want her to think they were related!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And suddenly Tucker could think of something he&#39;d &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like to unwrap come Christmas morning….&lt;/p&gt;
