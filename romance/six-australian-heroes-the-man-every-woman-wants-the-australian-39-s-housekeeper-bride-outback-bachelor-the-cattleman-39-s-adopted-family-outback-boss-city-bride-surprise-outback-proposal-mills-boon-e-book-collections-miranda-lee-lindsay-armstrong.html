          &lt;strong&gt;Six Australian Heroes&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE MAN EVERY WOMAN WANTS by Miranda Lee&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sexy playboy Ryan Armstrong is the last man on earth Laura wants to share a bedroom with for a whole weekend – but she needs his help! Soon Ryan will make his move, and Laura’s afraid that she won’t even want to resist…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE AUSTRALIAN’S HOUSEKEEPER BRIDE by Lindsay Armstrong&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Australian billionaire Lee Richardson hires Rhiannon Fairfax to bring his country mansion back to life. Stormy, complex and autocratic, Lee disturbs her hard-won peace of mind. He needs a wife - and he wants Rhiannon! But as family secrets begin to emerge, she can&#39;t help but wonder if she can really trust her new husband…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;OUTBACK BACHELOR by Margaret Way&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Skye McCory grew up dreaming of dating the heir to the famous McGovern cattle empire but Keefe McGovern was way out of her league. Now she’s a high-flying lawyer and back in Dinjara… But Skye and Keefe coming together would blow their families apart…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE CATTLEMAN’S ADOPTED FAMILY by Barbara Hannay&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tall, rangy, and stop-and-stare gorgeous in his battered jeans and faded shirt, Outback cattleman Seth Reardon sets Amy Ross’s nerves jangling. There’s no time for distractions, Amy’s come to Serenity in the driving rain to tell Seth he’s a father!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;OUTBACK BOSS, CITY BRIDE by Jessica Hart&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Meredith&#39;s been forced to take a job on a remote cattle station, with a boss she can&#39;t stand! It should be easy to keep things professional– except their office is under the blistering Outback sun, and Hal&#39;s work attire is a bare chest and thigh-hugging jeans! Although they&#39;re worlds apart, it&#39;s getting harder to keep things strictly business…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SURPRISE: OUTBACK PROPOSAL by Jennie Adams&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gorgeous Alex is ten years her junior, so he really shouldn’t make Jayne want to drop her professional guard! Driven and career-focused, Alex also doesn’t have time for casual flings. Yet could a trip into the Outback together have surprising consequences?&lt;/p&gt;
