Struggling with feelings of distrust for his father, he battles his attraction to a woman cloaked in secrets while haunted by dreams of a love lost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Held captive with her husband and son, Lizzie longs to tell Zach the truth, but doesn&#39;t know if she can trust him to not only protect the son he loves, but also safeguard the family he doesn&#39;t remember. When the choice of whom to trust is wrenched from her control, she risks everything in a frantic gamble to prevent their captor from rebuilding his legacy on the lives of her stolen family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
