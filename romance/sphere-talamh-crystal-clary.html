      <meta name="description" content="If you were able to go back in time and change anything: Would you? Could you? Should

(A GS-14 government agent) Richard Clary is simply going through the motions of life. He 
worked hard to reach his present position, but it actually means nothing without his lovely 
wife, Kathy by his side. She died of cancer a year ago. He and his daughter Crystal have 
struggled to continue without her. Crystals best friend Julia died shortly after at the hands 
of a serial killer. Rex Munday, the killer is still on the loose and free to kill again.
Richard stumbles upon a time-travel object: the Sphere. By accident, he and Crystal 
transfigure to the past. An adventure of a lifetime is before them. Actualizing the 
opportunity, Richard and his daughter embark on a voyage through space and time to right 
the wrong in their lives.
When they do visit the past, the killer is hot on their trail. Together they must survive and 
figure out how do you stop a serial killer?" />
