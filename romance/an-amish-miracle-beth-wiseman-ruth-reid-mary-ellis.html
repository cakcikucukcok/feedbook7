  <title>An Amish Miracle - Beth Wiseman, Ruth Reid, Mary Ellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always Beautiful by Beth Wiseman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becky Byler is eighteen and overweight. She is overwhelmed by the embarrassment she feels when comparing herself to other girls her age. Having lost all hope, she considers taking her own life. As she stands before rushing water, unable to swim, Becky begs God for a miracle. In just several months, Becky sees her prayers answered as food and temptation lose their hold over her. She&amp;rsquo;s finally pleased with how she looks, but does she like the person she has become? And has the man she has dreamed of been right beside her all along, loving her exactly as she is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always His Providence by Ruth Reid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widow Rosa Hostetler has one month to pay her delinquent taxes before the county auctions her farm. She&amp;rsquo;s prepared to sell whatever is necessary to pay the lien, but she isn&amp;rsquo;t willing to request money from the community&amp;rsquo;s widow fund. She&amp;rsquo;s embarrassed and refuses to admit she needs help. Rosa depends on income from selling eggs, but when that income is threatened, only a miracle can help Rosa accept the kindness of a neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always in My Heart by Mary Ellis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope Bowman believes God is punishing her for giving up her firstborn son when she was a teenager. She&amp;rsquo;s hidden this secret from her husband, who is thankful for their daughters but longs for a son. Hope prays desperately, but the son God sends her isn&amp;rsquo;t a new baby but the fifteen-year-old boy she gave up years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
