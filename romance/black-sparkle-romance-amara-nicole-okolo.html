  <title>Black Sparkle Romance - Amara Nicole Okolo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Meet Mira Adure: an ambitious, creative twenty-something stuck as PA to the ruthless editor of high fashion magazine Black Sparkle. Her work is tedious, but her love life is even worse - a string of disastrous dates threatens to put Mira off men forever. And then she crashes into the flashy Mercedes of the gorgeous, tiger-eyed Dominic and is left fuming. Mira’s luck changes when she is promoted to assistant editor. But when Dominic turns up at her office a few days later, she is infuriated to discover he’s been hired as the photographer for her first edition in charge of Black Sparkle. As they embark on a photo shoot by the swaying palms of Coconut Beach, Mira and Dominic can’t stop arguing. Will it be too late before Mira realises that beneath the tension is smouldering desire? Sparks fly as the creative energy of two talented individuals fuels a heady mix of fear, passion and desire." />
