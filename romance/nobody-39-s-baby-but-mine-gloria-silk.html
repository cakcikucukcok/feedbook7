      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Gripping, romantic, sensuous and astute.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;New women&amp;#39;s fiction that touches all parts of our needs, wants and the possibilities.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can Rachel and James find their way back into each other&amp;rsquo;s hearts after tasting temptation and facing devastating news? How strong &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;love in the face of reality? With an adoring patient saint of a husband, James Windsor, their seven year marriage has grown from great to blessed. But after five years of trying all Rachel yearns for is a baby.&lt;br /&gt;

Her marriage is perfect...well, until she bumps into her sexy ex-lover, Brandon. The Italian knows his way around women, and Rachel is disgusted at how tempted she is to spend time with him, in the name of her work, of course.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Realizing how desperate she has become at the crazy thought if Brandon can get her pregnant she decides to have further exploratory fertility tests. That is when meeting a beautiful pregnant career woman seems destined. As they become close friends the young woman offers Rachel a gift that will change many people&amp;#39;s lives.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But her loving, patient husband has been withdrawing lately. Is it really his career or is there something he&amp;#39;s not sharing with Rachel? Does he still love her and can they ever become a happy family, or is it too little too late?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And where Brandon come into all this when she discovers her husband&amp;#39;s biggest betrayal?&lt;/p&gt;" />
