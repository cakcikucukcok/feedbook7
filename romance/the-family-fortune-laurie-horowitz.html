  <title>The Family Fortune - Laurie Horowitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jane Austen in Boston: a modern retelling of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Persuasion &lt;/em&gt;in which the sensible daughter of a flighty Brahmin family finds love against all odds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jane Fortune&#39;s fortunes have taken a downturn. Thanks to the profligate habits of her father and older sister, the family&#39;s money has evaporated and Jane has to move out of the only home she&#39;s ever known: a stately brick town house on Boston&#39;s prestigious Beacon Hill. Thirty-eight and terminally single, Jane has never pursued idle pleasures like her sibling and father. Instead, she has devoted her time to running the Fortune Family Foundation, a revered philanthropic institution that has helped spark the careers of many a budding writer, including Max Wellman, Jane&#39;s first&amp;#8212;and only&amp;#8212;love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Jane has lost her luster. Max, meanwhile, has become a bestselling novelist and a renowned literary lothario. But change is afoot. And in the process of saving her family and reigniting the flames of true love, Jane might just find herself becoming the woman she was always meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;" />
