      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creating a Hopeful Future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Harnessing our creative energies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Re-framing our values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Changing our focus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Global Community needs a pivotal idea to give it purpose, direction and meaning. What would you choose as your guiding principle for the world?
&lt;p&gt;Transforming the world is everybody&#39;s business - we all inhabit a little bit of it, and we have a vested interest in keeping it going, and in improving it. Choosing an idea which we can all get behind, regardless of nationality, race, sex, class, religious belief, or political affiliation can help us work towards a more hopeful future in which we can all share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life&#39;s Lessons examines the three organizational principles of education, business and government which involve all of us in one way or another, and seeks to shed light on how we might refocus our values and create a more inclusive society. Together, we can design education systems which care more about people than performance, businesses which care more about people than profit and governments which care more about people than politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are invited to explore the history and evolution of our collective society through the writings of some of our most creative thinkers, and to discover our shared human values. The lessons have all been taught - we just need to put them into effect. Find your voice, and join together to create a future worth living for our children and our children&#39;s children. &lt;/p&gt;" />
