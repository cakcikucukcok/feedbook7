  <title>The Dna of Achievers - Mathew Knowles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The DNA of Achievers: 10 Traits of Highly Successful Professionals is intended to be a business-oriented, motivational, and inspirational book all rolled into one. As the title suggests, it focuses on characteristics that are common among successful people from all walks of life. 
Throughout his long career, Mr. Knowles has encountered individuals who have motivated, inspired, and contributed to his success. The authors goal is to recount illustrative true-life experiences of ten traits commonly shared by successful people. His personal top ten are: 1) passion; 2) vision; 3) work ethic; 4) team-building; 5) planning; 6) talk-to-do ratio; 7) learning from failure; 8) giving back; 9) risk-taking; and 10) thinking outside the box. 
As a self-made entrepreneurial success story who came from a small town and became the top salesperson at Xerox Medical System, sold successful businesses he created, and became one of the worlds top entertainment managers and executives in the music industry, the author embodied all of these traits. 
The DNA of Achievers features nearly thirty inspirational essays by luminaries in all areas of entrepreneurship, entertainment, sports, and philanthropynot to mention a singer or two!" />
