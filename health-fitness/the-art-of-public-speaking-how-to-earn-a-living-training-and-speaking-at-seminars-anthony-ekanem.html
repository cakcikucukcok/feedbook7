  <title>The Art of Public Speaking: How to Earn a Living Training and Speaking At Seminars - Anthony Ekanem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Any guide to success in an endeavor will tell you that there is no magic formula to success.  But in a lot of fields of endeavor, there seem to be &quot;insider secrets&quot;.  And taking on the challenge of becoming a truly great public speaker is a noble ambition.  But if you could learn the insider secret that makes the difference between good public speakers and great ones, that would help you make that transition.    Actually there is one great secret to what makes speakers that really shine in front of a group so great.  But it is not magic or something that you can take as a pill, and an hour later, you are ready to stand up and dazzle the crowd.  It is a very simple process that is something you already know a lot about.  It is just simple, old fashioned hard work and preparation.  The further in advance you can start getting ready for a presentation, the better your public speaking will be.  You know that feeling of terror that you experience when you address a crowd." />
