  <title>Wake up Black Man and Black Woman - Alpha Omega Riddick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Black people of America, we need to stop reading books about thug life and street life. We need to read books that will open our minds to ideas and issues that will help us and our families and the future of black generations of this country. Black people of America, we were here before most of the other nationalities that are here now. We should be in a much better financial situation than we are in now. Most of us are at the bottom or near the bottom of the economic scale as a whole. We have to learn from the foreigners that stick together and open up businesses in our community. Plus we have to stop giving our hard-earned money to other nationalities and none to ourselves; in a way, we are still slaves. I wrote this book to inspire Black Americans to open there eyes to the positive changes we need to make to help our families and future black generations in America. This book shows how we are living compared to other nationalities in America, as well as the factors that are holding us back as a whole. We must remember our ancestors and the sacrifices they made when they were slaves. They were the strongest people in the world, and we are their descendants. I feel they were superhuman beings to make that trip from Africa to America. We as black Americans have that same ability in us to survive. Remember, we are the alpha race. We need to wake up and stop hitting the snooze button. May God bless this book and everyone that reads it." />
