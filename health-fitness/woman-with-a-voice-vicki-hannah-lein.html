  <title>Woman with a Voice - Vicki Hannah Lein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You have never read a book quite like this one, and you will never be the same when you finish this unique literary adventure.  Woman with a Voice is a great selection for book groups; each chapter ends with a Your Turn section, giving readers a chance to put new insights into action.  WARNING:  You may cry as you read how Vicki stood up to her father, refusing to listen to a racist joke.  You may discover you are mixed up with a soul-killing man when you read How to Spot a Real Man.  You may decide you are finally going to give yourself the love you deserve when you finish the chapter on Impeccable Self Care.  You may feel compelled to give this book to everyone you really care about.
These little miracles are offered in  a unique combination of candor and humor.  Vicki Hannah Lein shares the discovery of her authentic voice as she offers help to readers who want to do the same. Through stories, poems, and song lyrics, she shares insights about growing up in a home with too much drinking and violence. At age forty-three, Vicki loses her central vision and is forced to redefine and rediscover her purpose on the planet. Part autobiographical, part self-help and spiritual growth, this book provides hours of validation and inspiration for anyone who desires to live from their deepest truth and highest calling.
Early Reviews
The book is absolutely FABULOUS! My husband and I are reading it together.  Just the introduction has inspired us to stand true to ourselves.
