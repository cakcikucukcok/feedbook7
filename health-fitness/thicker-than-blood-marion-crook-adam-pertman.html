  <title>Thicker Than Blood - Marion Crook, Adam Pertman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The act of adopting children, and the processes and politics around it, have changed drastically in recent decades, mostly for the better. Still, many prospective adoptive parents remain bewildered or apprehensive, and those who have adopted find themselves struggling in ways they hadn&#39;t anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thicker Than Blood &lt;/I&gt;is a comprehensive yet down-to-earth look at adoptive parenting in the twenty-first century. Author Marion Crook&#39;s family includes two adopted sons; in her experience, adoptive parents need to acquire skills, knowledge, and a good sense of humor in order to deal with the emotional upheavals of raising adopted children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book looks at all facets of adoption, including its dark history over the past one hundred years when it was seen as a lower-class option for desperate parents, or when children were taken from single mothers against their will. Today, adoption is much more open-minded?LGBT adoptive parents and adoptive single parents are now commonplace?yet challenges linger, from adoptive children suffering from PTSD to those dealing with issues of anger and abandonment. Crook gently takes adoptive parents through the process of adoption from childhood to adulthood, helping to demystify the experience with compassion and reassurance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meticulously researched but refreshingly free of academic jargon, &lt;i&gt;Thicker Than Blood &lt;/I&gt;will enlighten and empower adoptive parents and those who work with adopted children alike.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marion Crook &lt;/B&gt;is the author of twenty-one previous books which include novels and nonfiction&amp;#160;for both adults and young people, on such subjects as women&#39;s health, teen suicide, and body image.&lt;/div&gt;" />
