  <title>What Shall We Do Next? - Anna Mallett, Margaret Mallett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you find yourself looking after a preschool child for the first time, or after a gap of some years, you will welcome this book. It explains how to encourage childrens sense of wonder by adopting a creative approach to a variety of activities both in and out of doors. Some need little or no preparation, and there is help with simple preparations for others. What Shall We Do Next? shows how sharing books can enrich many practical activities. A special feature is the inclusion of early fact books as well as stories. There are suggestions for the following:
 Music and water play for babies and for making dens, secret drawers and cafs for preschoolers
 Organizing exciting visits to beaches, parks and gardens
 Preparing for interesting visits to museums, train stations and zoos
 Developing the inner world of the imaginationreading and listening to stories and poems, engaging in role play
 Cooking, drawing, painting and dressing up
 Choosing early fact books, stories and rhymes and guidance on audio resources, television programmes and DVDs
The ideal resource for those times when children are bouncing with energy or becoming bored. Theyll soon be absorbed in these exciting activities.
