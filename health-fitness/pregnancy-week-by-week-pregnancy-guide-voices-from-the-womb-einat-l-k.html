  <title>Pregnancy week by week : Pregnancy Guide: Voices from the womb - Einat L. K.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You are probably curious to know what goes on inside your womb: How your baby is developing. What can be a better way than &quot;hearing&quot; about it from your baby himself? Being pregnant is both an incredible privilege and significant event in the lives of women that are fortunate enough to carry a child. While it&#39;s a time filled with wonder and hope, it&#39;s also marked by dramatic physical and emotional changes and major decisions. For each of those 42 weeks, you&#39;ll get an insider&#39;s perspective - that is, your baby&#39;s view - on how he or she is developing inside the womb and what changes you might be seeing or feeling. This book is also available in a journal format!" />
