  <title>Grace to Do It with Dignity - ‘C’JPB</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dignity
I write this book to help those who are also going through trying
times,struggling situations and devastating experiences.
This book is intended to encourage, strengthen, enlighten and
educate persons and people
 while patiently waiting for and moving toward great victory and victories.
This book is not intended to hurt, harm or expose anyone or anything.
For LOVE is EVERLASTING and LOVE is ETERNAL. And I am LOVE.
 Dignity is the quality or state of being worthy of esteem and or respect.
This poem describes it best:
&quot;Dignity&quot;
Dignity is the ability to STAND STRONG and tall in the face of 
adversity
While being able to bow to the elderly and *yet crawl with
children
Dignity is taking a stand for your BELIEFS
Without closing your mind to another&#39;s opinions
Dignity is being an example by your DEEDS and through
your WORDS 
Avoiding gossip, anger and lies
Dignity will manifest itself in the warmth of your SMILE,
the depth of your LOVE and *your KINDNESS *to *and 
*for your FELLOWMAN
                                                            Mychal Wynn
