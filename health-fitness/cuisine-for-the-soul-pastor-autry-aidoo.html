      <meta name="description" content="In this book you will find a little of this and a lot of that. That is the way
that I M. I have written a few pieces of poetry, a sermon or two and some
recipes. I hope you enjoy!
In preparing a meal you always think about it and them gather the
necessary ingredients that help make Arcady meal. Life is not any different.
Many beginners, when cooking, need a good cookbook or recipe to follow.
My sermons and recipes are to you, the reader, as a guideline when staring
off in cooking or ministry. This poetry is to remind us of who we are:
I am your prophetess, your diva, your cook, your housekeeper, your
cleaner, your gleaner. Your body, your twine, Im your peace of mind And
you are mine.
Life is like an onion you take it with delight and afterwards you
wonder whatever made you bite. look forward to the next book . . . My
man doesnt know how to love me" />
