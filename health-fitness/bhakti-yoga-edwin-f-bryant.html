  <title>Bhakti Yoga - Edwin F. Bryant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the author of what has become the standard edition of &lt;i&gt;The Yoga Sutras of Pata単jali&lt;/i&gt;, an exploration of probably the most significant tradition in Hinduism, along with a rendering of key texts and parables from that tradition&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bhakti Yoga&lt;/i&gt; explores one of the eight &quot;limbs&quot; of yoga. In the simplest terms, bhakti yoga is the practice of devotion, which is the essential heart of yoga and of Hinduism in general. In recent times, the term has come to be used in a rather simplistic way to refer to the increasingly popular practice of kirtan, or chanting in a group or at large gatherings. But bhakti yoga is far more complex and ancient than today&#39;s growing kirtan audiences are aware, and embraces many strands and practices. Edwin F. Bryant focuses on one famous and important school of bhakti and explores it in depth to show what bhakti is and how it is expressed. And he supplies his own renderings of central texts from that tradition in the form of &quot;tales and teachings&quot; from an important work called the &lt;i&gt;Bh&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;gavata Pura&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;, or &quot;The Beautiful Legend of God.&quot; This clarifying work establishes a baseline for understanding, and will be welcomed by all serious students of the spiritual heritage of India.&lt;/p&gt;" />
