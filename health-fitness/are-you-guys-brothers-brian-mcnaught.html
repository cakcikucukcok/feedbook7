  <title>Are You Guys Brothers? - Brian McNaught</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Same-sex intimacy, particularly between males, can be a
challenge to maintain for gay and bisexual men, and extremely
threatening to heterosexual men. &lt;i&gt;Are You Guys Brothers?&lt;/i&gt;, a
question asked of male couples throughout the world, is a very personal
and candid look at the topic through the lens of an immensely happy and
successful 32-year relationship. Brian McNaught and Ray Struble, both
Irish Catholic, Midwestern children of seven, met in Boston in their
twenties as one was beginning a career as a &quot;gay activist&quot; and the
other was entering the world of commercial banking. Their love became
the envy of their families and friends, marked by open communication,
good humor, patience, and spirituality. They would need all four to
navigate the mine-filled waters of childhood sexual abuse, alcoholism,
intense religious and political opposition, dramatically-disparate
incomes, a sexually-open relationship, aging, erectile dysfunction, and
an often unsupportive and frequently dysfunctional gay community.
Today, they are officially married, and the &quot;gay activist&quot; is now
educating his spouse&#39;s former Wall Street colleagues on gay issues in
offices around the world. This book is funny, deeply moving, and highly
instructive, of particular interest to gay men and women who seek
guidance in building and maintaining their relationships, and to
heterosexual men and women worldwide who want to better understand not
only gay people but also how to get past the roadblocks to
intimacy in their own relationships.&lt;br&gt;" />
