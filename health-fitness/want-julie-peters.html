  <title>Want - Julie Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rediscover Love and Desire after Sexual Assault&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Readers of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Body Keeps the Score&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Deepest Well&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Trauma Stewardship&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;should read&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Want: Recovering Desire after Sexual Assault&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have the courage to heal.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We know, increasingly, how common and devastating sexual violence is for women, but we don’t always talk about how survivors can recover from the trauma and return to desire, sexuality, trust, and pleasure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Want&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the story of how Julie Peters did just that—and how you can, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move past the fog of trauma.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In the years after the assault, Julie was in what she calls&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;the fog of trauma&lt;/em&gt;: the colorless, tasteless experience of barely getting through the day. No one—not counsellors, support groups, or other survivors—could give her any advice about how to find the desire that could bring her back to joy, intimacy, and connection. She had to make it up on her own. In&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Want&lt;/em&gt;, Julie tells the story of getting from the devastation of trauma to living a full life in eight sometimes challenging, often bumbling, and occasionally delightful steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience hope, healing and recovery.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We have plenty of stories about the helplessness, frustration, and vengeful feelings that can follow trauma. Culturally, we have started a conversation about these experiences, and we’re all confused about what this all means for our relationships with each other. We need stories of hope, healing, and recovery. Survivors of assault, if you&#39;ve been thinking to yourself, &quot;I thought it was just me,&quot; Julie is here to show you that you are not alone. Your loved ones may not know how to support you, but they can learn more about your experiences and how to walk alongside you through this book, just as you can learn how to recover from the trauma you&#39;ve experienced.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Want&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;offers a window into one person’s experience of recovery—plus the happy ending we all need to know is possible after trauma.&lt;/p&gt;" />
