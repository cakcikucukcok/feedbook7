  <title>Fathers I Have Known - Ernest Wylie Harkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sometimes referred to as his Accidental Self Help book, Ernest Wylie Harkins has compiled a series of life lessons, valuable rules for living, acquired from his various father figures, with a few of his own original rules thrown in for good measure.
Like Ben Franklin, he has tried to emulate the admirable in others, and of course Franklin himself is among his supplemental Fathers in that and other ways.  He also adopted Franklins general approach to self improvement as well, making a plan, making small changes continuously. 
Drawing from influences throughout his life, from family, from teachers, public figures, and people casually met along the way,  he relates the background and situation that produced the little nuggets of wisdom.  
Some are mundane (Just Keep Peckin at It), some lofty (Every Man is your Guru), some only examples and still others more in the vein of self help (Life is the Illusion of Attitude), but all are worth considering for your own adoption.
Finally, there is the self help prescription, how you too can benefit from a similar self examination." />
