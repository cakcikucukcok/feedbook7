  <title>Days and Nights in Summerville - G.L. Giles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="G.L. Giles is grateful to be one of the &quot;Indie Author&quot; success stories. Shes had over 140 major bookstore signings (for various Borders, Barnes &amp; Noble and Waldenbooks stores) in nine states in the Southeast and Midwest over the last two years.  Shes also signed at some wonderful Independent Bookstores and businesses during this time as well.  Shes been on television six times talking about her books for various stations in South Carolina, Alabama and Georgia.  In 2008, she had the career-making experience of being interviewed by the legendary Joe Franklin about being a nontraditionally published author and about her popular vampire series; it aired on his Bloomberg Radio show in New York and was heard by millions in 2008.  Shes been a Top 10 Royalty Earner for her publisher and was recently honored by being in the &quot;Author Spotlight&quot; at their site.  Furthermore, shes had an article, poem and interviews published in MetaCreative Magazine in 2008, and she writes a book review column called &quot;The G.L. Giles Files&quot; for Psychic Times.  Her experiences with the unique challenges of being a self-published and successful author are gathered and presented in the first article in this book entitled &quot;My Advice on Marketing your Nontraditionally Published Book.&quot;  In the spirit of thwarting the hegemony and not being anti-hodgepodgery, shes also included in this anthology some of her award-winning poetry, micro-fiction, short stories and sample chapters, etc. from the final book in her vampire series.  Finally, she decided it would be fun to include some of the digital pictures shes taken over the last few years while living on the edge of the vibrant spinney in Summerville, South Carolina." />
