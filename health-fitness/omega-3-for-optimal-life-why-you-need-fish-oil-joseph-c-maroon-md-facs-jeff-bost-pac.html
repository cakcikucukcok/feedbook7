  <title>Omega-3 for Optimal Life: Why You Need Fish Oil - Joseph C. Maroon, Md, Facs, Jeff Bost, Pac</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fish oil&#39;s universal actions and benefits make it one of the best choices for all Americans to influence their health for the better. Taking fish oil as a supplement or as part of a healthy diet, along with adequate amounts of exercise and stress reduction, can save lives, prevent disease, and reduce our healthcare requirements.   In this book, we will discuss the latest science on the benefits of omega-3&#39;s and how this special molecule can benefit every organ in our body. We will also focus on how our body&#39;s innate natural protective mechanism, the inflammatory response, is hijacked by our poor diet and lifestyle choices and contributes, rather than prevents diseases of aging. We will give you the information you need to make better choices when looking for fish oil supplements and help you determine what dose of omega-3&#39;s works best for you. We hope to lead you down a road of exciting discovery, give you the tools to make better choices and help you to die young... as late as possible!" />
