  <title>Meridians and Stable Water Clusters - Shui Yin Lo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With thousands of years history and your own experience in using or benefiting from meridian-based medical practices, you many not feel that you need physical proof of the existence of meridian lines and points.  However, it is the lack of visual proof that has kept the Western health community, including the insurance companies, from fully accepting the practices of the East like acupuncture and acupressure. Those who understand meridian theory know that it is not just the ability to help heal that is important in Eastern practice, but the focus on health maintenance through maintaining the flow of energy throughout the body.  There are many people trying to establish the proof of meridian theory and this book contributes to this goal by presenting a sample of the work of Dr. Shui Yin Lo, who uses infrared photography in his research and has discovered its ability to reveal easily the 14 major meridians in Eastern meridian theory. We all know that we need a more efficient and cost effect approach to medical care and this book will provide a major steppingstone towards that goal." />
