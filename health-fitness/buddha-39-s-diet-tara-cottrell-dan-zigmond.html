  <title>Buddha&#39;s Diet - Tara Cottrell, Dan Zigmond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;There&#39;s a lot you probably don&#39;t know about the Buddha. For one, the real Buddha was thin. And before he became the &quot;Enlightened One,&quot; he was a pampered prince named Siddhartha. He tried dieting once and didn&#39;t like it any more than you do. Instead, he sought a &quot;middle way&quot; between unhealthy overindulgence and unrealistic abstinence. The instructions he gave his monks about eating, more than 2,500 years ago, were surprisingly simple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fast forward to today, and modern science confirms what Buddha knew all along. It&#39;s not what you eat that&#39;s important, but when you eat. You don&#39;t need to follow the latest fads or give up your favorite foods. You just have to remember a few guidelines that Buddha provided-guidelines that, believe it or not, will help you lose weight, feel better, and stop obsessing about food. Sure, Buddha lived before the age of doughnuts and French fries, but his wisdom and teachings endure, providing us with a sane, mindful approach to achieving optimum health.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
