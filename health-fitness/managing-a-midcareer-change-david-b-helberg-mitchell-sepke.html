  <title>Managing a Midcareer Change - David B. Helberg, Mitchell Sepke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David B. Helberg advises numerous business leaders and is widely known for his coaching, mentoring, and lecturing prowess. But once he felt like he was stuck in his careerlike you might feel now.
In this guidebook to getting unstuck, he shares how he transformed himself from a rank-and-file employee to a happy and successful businessman. Learn how to:
	recognize when youre stuck at a job or in a career thats not right for you;
	rid yourself of feelings of loyalty and/or entitlement;
	develop an exit strategy to leave an employer;
	block other people out so you can focus on improving yourself; and
	turn responsibilities (such as paying for a mortgage and taking care of your family) into motivation.
While it might be easy to stay at a job youre not happy with (especially if it pays well), you need to challenge yourself to improve as a person. When you stay stationary in life, things get boring and stale.
Take an honest look at where you stand, and plot a path to get where you want to go with the practical advice in Managing a Midcareer Change." />
