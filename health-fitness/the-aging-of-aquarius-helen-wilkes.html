  <title>The Aging of Aquarius - Helen Wilkes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Live your passion and purpose and change the world as an empowered elder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Your career has wound down, the kids have moved, and your schedule is clear...for the next 30 years. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In your youth, you cared about people and planet earth, and you had 
grand visions of changing the world. At some point, those passions and 
that sense of purpose got buried under diapers and the 9-5. Still, that 
old you remains alive. Now, with the rest of your life ahead, you can be
 the change and make this next stage of your life the most powerful yet.
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But where to start?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Helen Wilkes, a retired professor and activist, takes readers on an 
inspiring journey to find renewed purpose in retirement. Along the way 
she helps readers navigate the transition to a post-work identity by 
fanning the embers of lost passions and developing new interests. 
Whether you are drawn to gardening clubs, to social justice issues, 
political campaigning, ethical investing, or creativity through the 
arts, The Aging of Aquarius 
offers inspiration, practical steps, and extra resources to help 
reignite your passion, your sense of purpose, and to effect real change 
in the world as an empowered elder.&lt;br&gt;" />
