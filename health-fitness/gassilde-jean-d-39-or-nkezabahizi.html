It means she will marry youngand that the man she marries will have little or no respect for women. It means her father, brothers, and eventually her husband will have the right to beat heror worse. It means she will grow up in a farm community without an education. As one of seven children, she, along with her sisters and her mother, is expected to work in the fields each day to provide food for the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Gassildes mother, Claudia, wants a better life for Gassilde, and with a Tutsi friend devises a way for Gassilde to go to schoolagainst her fathers wishes and with horrible consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a newfound ability to dream of a life different from that of her mother and sisters, Gassildes future is set on a path where she faces conflict at every turn. This new life exposes her to extreme racism and violencebut, most of all, it exposes her to hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
