  <title>Ties of a Family - Ebona Hope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ties of a family: is a true story about events that occurred in the lives of one black family. There are no million dollar mansions, struggles for power or millionaires. They are an ordinary family that has been rooted and grounded in unconditional love and faith in God. This family Faced everyday issues that most families deal with; told through the eyes of one family member. I wrote this novel because I feel that theres a message in the trails that this family has faced.  I hope to reach out to someone whos facing a similar trail and if nothing else; give them comfort in knowing that God is real. He hears, sees and knows all that we face. He will never give you more than you can bear nor leave you alone but we in our daily walk often turn away from him." />
