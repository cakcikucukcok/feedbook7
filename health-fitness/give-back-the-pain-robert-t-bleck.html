  <title>Give Back the Pain - Robert T. Bleck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Believing that we all suffer from at least some emotional wounds as a result of our past experiences, Dr. Robert Bleck set out to devise a recovery therapy to aid his clients in &quot;coming to terms&quot; with those past hurts.  The result has come to be known as &lt;i&gt;Source Completion Therapy (SCT)&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;To live a healthy and enriched life, our past emtotional wounds-like bodily infections-must be cleansed and allowed to heal.  &lt;i&gt;Source Completion Therapy&lt;/i&gt; is designed to do just that.&quot;  &lt;i&gt;Dr. Bleck, Chapter 1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporating all the effective, significant psychological theories widely in use today, SCT takes us on a journey of personal exploration and emotional healing built on the theory that we can only break free of the disabling effects of our hurts if we &lt;i&gt;(first)&lt;/i&gt; become fully aware of their true origins, &lt;i&gt;(next)&lt;/i&gt; re-experience the trauma, and &lt;i&gt;(finally)&lt;/i&gt; complete the healing process by confronting the source of the pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  The text is completed by an easy-to-use self-hypnosis script designed to bring on the state of relaxation necessary for reliving and re-experiencing the events that created our symptoms.  Options for giving the pain back to its source (completing) are also offered.&lt;/p&gt;" />
