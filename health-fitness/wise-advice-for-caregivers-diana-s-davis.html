  <title>Wise Advice for Caregivers - Diana S Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wise Advice for Caregivers was inspired by the authors experience as a caregiver. She gives advice and guidance about how to best perform your job as a caregiver to a parent, family member, patient, or client, and also provides support for doing home care for the elderly. 
Many people have to provide elder care for their families, as the baby-boomer generation are rapidly becoming senior citizens who need care. This book, Wise Advice for Caregivers, also provides the definition of diseases, injuries, common surgeries, and sicknesses of the elderly. The definitions are explained with simple descriptions. 
The author also gives some common sense advice on how to deal with the various problems that occur in care giving, such as: how to move and lift the client, how to give comfort and love to someone who is dying, and how to prepare for the additional care needed during that time. 
The caregivers will need to heed advice to take care of themselves, so they dont experience burnout while care giving. She gives safety tips so you dont hurt yourself while transferring the client from one place to another, addresses hospice care for the dying patient, and gives a list as to what will occur from the start of disease to final days." />
