  <title>The Point of Deflection - Dr. M. Bahaidar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Point of Deflection is a book that gives you a deeper understanding of why people change in perception or even in behavior. Have you ever asked a kid what they want to be when they grow up? A quick answer may come up, such as being a doctor, a pilot, or whichever career they may be passionate about. But give it a duration of ten to fifteen years and ask a similar question to the same individuals, and the feedback may differ. So the question is, what changed?
What makes us different? Is it the influence of our society, family, and friends? Or is it the circumstance and peer pressure that mold us into better or worse individuals? Life is all about the steps we take that land us into either the arms of success or failure. All in all, these decisions are ours to make, and sometimes these choices may put us into an edge, stranded and with no hope. Going back may not be an option anymore, and heading forth is hopeless as a huge ocean of calamities may be confronting us with limited privileges since we are on a dead end.
At this point, its where people lose hope and give up, or some even commit suicide. We lose sight of our dreams and goals, and we forget destiny has a distinctive way of viewing things. A huge obstacle of natural disaster and nuclear crisis in Japan brought forth profound individuals such as Soichiro Honda. So instead of giving up, that may be destinys way of leading us into a different quest, which we may have no idea about. Rest assured that passion can be found in the darkest of circumstances." />
