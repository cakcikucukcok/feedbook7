  <title>The Drunk Diet - Luc Carl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With his trademark Rock &#39;N Roll hair and snakeskin spandex pants, plus a hot rod and a Harley, Lüc Carl fit the part as a bar manager based in New York City&#39;s gritty Lower East Side. And life was good for this Omaha, Nebraska, transplant--a talented drummer who originally moved to the big city to pursue his Rock &#39;N Roll dreams--until, suddenly, it wasn&#39;t. Fast forward through seven years of working long hours, bingeing on late-night Chinese food, and drinking excessively; life had found Lüc forty pounds overweight and completely out of shape. But when he turned to the &quot;experts&quot; for advice--reading countless fitness and weight-loss books in the process--he discovered that they all made the same claim: &quot;You can&#39;t drink alcohol if you want to lose weight.&quot; Lüc decided to take matters into his own hands to transform his body and his life &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; way--a sort of &quot;f*ck you&quot; to all those so-called experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full of charismatic wit and raucous stories about his life, &lt;i&gt;The Drunk Diet&lt;/i&gt; will inspire and challenge you to become fitter, healthier, and happier. Lüc&#39;s fitness philosophy isn&#39;t about following a list of rigid rules or traditional &quot;do this, not that&quot; charts, but gaining a better understanding of how the body works and discovering what you&#39;re personally willing to change about your lifestyle in order to reach your goals. For him, that meant trading in the crap he was eating for unprocessed, natural foods and embracing a newfound love for exercise, but never sacrificing his social life (or his love for cold beer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the story of how one chain-smoking, cheeseburger-eating, hard-partying Rock &#39;N Roller--a self-proclaimed &quot;out-of-shape, bloated asshole&quot;--grew into an avid runner and cyclist and, ultimately, a happier version of himself. He will be the first to tell you: If he could do it, so can you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
