&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read. Reminisce. Receive. Restore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ever dated someone and felt the need to take drastic measures to preserve your feelings?&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, me too! You want to give more of you, show more of yourself, and open up a little more. But, you&#39;re afraid! Youre afraid that something so sweet could become so bitter. So you caution yourself See, the beauty in Robot Love is it doesn&#39;t have to end! So, take your time and be mindful of your emotions. But, keep in mind that, it&#39;s OK for one Robot to love, and miss another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever received a call from someone and felt the need to go into IMMEDIATE Prayer?&lt;/strong&gt; You think, &quot;Lord, should I answer this call?&quot; Sometimes, you have to push the call-end button. Quite frankly, I find myself doing it more often. Its not because I dont want to be of service, but its hard to help someone who becomes rebellious against assistance. So, help if you can. But, know that its OK to let him/her go so you can grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember when you were a kid and had imaginary talks with yourself about growing up?&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah me too! I can still hear my mother saying, You better stay a child as long as you can. Momma told me there would be days when I wish I were still a kid. And you know what? She aint ever lied! Despite my age, I still need her help. I never anticipated facing so many challenges as an adult. From me to youJust be careful with what you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
