  <title>Scuttie the Dog - Phyllis Livingston Suber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was at work the first time I had a vision about writing a book. So I started to read childrens books to get an idea of how to start this process. This started in 1976. I didnt know how to get started, but I kept the idea in mind. In 1978, I took classes at a technical school. I took reading, writing, and arithmetic. I loved writing, and the instructor said I was really good. So, in the year of 1991, I got a job as a Headstart teacher and was able to read stories to children every day. It occurred to me that I could do this too. So, in 2005, I wrote my first book. That book was titled Scuttie the Dog. I have written at least fifteen to twenty more books for children that I would love to have published." />
