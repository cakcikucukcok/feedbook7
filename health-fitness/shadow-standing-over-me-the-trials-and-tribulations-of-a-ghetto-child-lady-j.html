  <title>Shadow Standing over Me the Trials and Tribulations of a Ghetto Child. - Lady J</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have always considered Hamilton, Ohio home. It is were I was born, raised and been through a struggle, yet I still consider it home. I was that one child. That one child who, despite circumstances, pain and sorrow, have preservered and triumphed. While they may not be what you would call triumphs, they are still mine and that through it all - I stand tall and confident in who I am and I LOVE ME and all that I am. 
This is my story. And for all the time that a story was told about myself, this will shed the light on the truth from the beginning. Some will love it, some will like it and some will hate it and be angry - The truth tends to bring that out in folks. My story is to be an open and living testimony that no matter where you live, what circumstances you are born into, what trials you have gone through - YOU CAN MAKE IT! If you want to...life is bittersweet for me, I learned the hard way that only the strong will survive...life WILL kick you in the teeth - either you will stay down, cry and whine about it or get up, rinse out your mouth, put ice on it and keep it moving. 
Please see my story as a cautionary tale of how to be a better advocate and protector of your children, make better life choices, always keep moving and despite the hard times, God always looks out and protect those who believe. 
God Bless, 
Lady J" />
