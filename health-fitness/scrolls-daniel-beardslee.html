  <title>Scrolls - Daniel Beardslee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I walk through the castle. Ghosts emerge from the ground, and everyone from the past wars spread all across the states. Awaken the beast within their bodies and souls.
America has been awakened. A king from the underground of the castle awakens and calls to me and says that the angels from heaven called to me to fight it and stand like a stone building. A faint voice whispers in my ears. 
Standing before the king he asks me, I have a job for you. A soft heavenly voice has called upon me to lead the kings to victory in the west to defeat evil.
My family is the last to call on I drop to my knees and say, Can you save them? He spoke and told me, Yes, they are in the mountains to the west, in the mountains of Colorado, in the deepest underground tunnel. 
Now I know where they are." />
