  <title>The Paths That Lie Ahead - Melvin T. Luster Jr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ABOUT THE BOOK:
	Have you ever met a person that was faced with many difficult challenges in life, but still made it? If you havent, allow me to introduce you to Milton Lusser. Milton is from a single parent home in a housing project where drug dealing is the norm and a way of life; he was kicked out of school for his retaliation to a racial slur and almost didnt graduate; his father who he has never met or seen before just pops up one day out of the blue wanting to play daddy; and hes easily influence when it comes to making important decisions.
	He leaves his home in Knoxville, TN to pursue a new life and a four year Business degree from the College of Alaska in Fairbanks, AK. After a couple of years of being there he was introduced to much, much more outside of his degree then one would expect. Through his determination to fit in and be apart of the in crowd he changed his name, character, personality, and persona. Ultimately transforming himself into something he wasnt; a Hustler. By DESTINY he experiences a lavish and successful lifestyle.  He lived the life that struggling and up in-coming drug dealers can only dream of, but just like in every illegal business something always goes wrong (Snitches).
	In Money, Power, and Betrayal you will see how grimy the dope game can get from a first hand viewpoint, and how quick so called friends and love ones will turn on you. You will also get the chance to follow Milton as he chooses The Paths that Lie Ahead for his life." />
