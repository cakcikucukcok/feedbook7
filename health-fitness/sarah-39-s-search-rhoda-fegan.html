  <title>Sarah&#39;s Search - Rhoda Fegan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Destiny!  Fate!  Sarah didn’t believe that life was contributable to these uncontrollable forces, but to the choices of human beings, and a very real and loving God.   Although still single, she believed that God’s plan for her included marriage and a family with her as a pastor’s wife or hopefully, the wife of a foreign missionary.  Her prayers for this very special man and their service together were more than a decade old.  She saw no likely candidates, but trusted God with her life.
 Warning, Satan&#39;s demon observer, reports to his Master that Sarah is becoming a real threat to Satan’s plans.  Demons are ordered to intervene, but Sarah’s angels don’t leave her defenseless.  Is God working and answering prayers?  Will the assigned demons keep Sarah from a future with Fillip who is not saved and who has distanced himself from God?" />
