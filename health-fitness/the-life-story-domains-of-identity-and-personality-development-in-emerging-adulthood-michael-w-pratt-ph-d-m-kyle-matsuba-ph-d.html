  <title>The Life Story, Domains of Identity, and Personality Development in Emerging Adulthood - Michael W. Pratt Ph.D., M. Kyle Matsuba Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;The Life Story, Domains of Identity, and Personality Development in Emerging Adulthood&lt;/em&gt; focuses on individuals&#39; formulations of the unique episodes and events of their lives that give one meaning and a sense of personal identity. This book brings the growing research on narrative study and the life story into focus by drawing from the existing research on personality development during emerging adulthood.
In this book, authors Michael W. Pratt and M. Kyle Matsuba present a series of chapters exploring how one&#39;s life story manifests across the many components of their developing identity, including their religion, morality, vocation, society, and the relationships they have with their parents, peers, and romantic partners. Taking their cue from Erik Erikson&#39;s model of adolescent and adult development, the authors show readers exactly how a life story approach can illuminate the distinctive features of an individual&#39;s personality and development during this formative phase of life.
Organized around a set of life contexts where personality is manifested (i.e. adjustment, personal ideology, close relationships, occupation, and civic life), this book draws on the authors&#39; own longitudinal research on the development of the life story in emerging adulthood. Throughout the book, they incorporate fascinating case studies and historical examples (e.g., Darwin, Pope Francis, Martin Luther King, Jr., Jane Fonda) of individuals&#39; unique development during this period of life in order to better illustrate the application of this approach to understanding the whole person in context." />
