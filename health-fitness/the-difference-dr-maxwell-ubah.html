  <title>The Difference - Dr Maxwell Ubah.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why do some people succeed and others fail under the same conditions and circumstances? Put in another way, why do some people with limited resources, opportunities and potentials fare better in life than others who seemed to have it all? What accounts for the difference between successful people and ordinary people, between successful companies and the also-rans, and between successful nations and kleptocracies?
In The Difference, Leadership Coach and Strategy Consultant Dr Maxwell Ubah writes that successful people are not different from ordinary people; they only do things differently. Using an ancient parable between an entrepreneur and his three employees, he identified ten principles of success that set successful people apart from ordinary people. 
Dr Ubah Maxwell has hit a home run with The Difference. It challenges individuals to leave the beaten path of mediocrity and live a life of personal significance. I strongly recommend it to all who desire to achieve the extraordinary with their lives.

Dr Maxwell Ubah has packaged a little dynamite that could blow off the shell shielding success. Or put more appropriately, The Difference is a roadmap to success and fulfilment in life, as long as were ready to blow off the lid.
