  <title>Micronations - Mohhammad Bahareth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is a Micro Nation?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A micro nation can actually be referred to as new country project or a model country. The definition of a micro nation is thus rendered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An entity that resembles a nation or a state, but which for the most part exists only on paper, on the Internet, or in the mind of its creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also referred to as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Model countries and new country projects -- are entities that claim to be independent nations or states but which are unrecognized by world governments or major international organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different reasons exist why micro nations are created some being extremely serious whereas others are as a result of a hobby. There are however very genuine micro nations which are made of an entire community or tribe. These small entities almost always exist as replicas of real nations as opposed to existing states. We can therefore say that these are small nations with a small geographical area as well as populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term micro nation can also be used synonymously with the term Fifth nation which also refers to social identity groups. Compared to micronations are macronations which are significantly larger and enjoy some territorial recognition and these are referred to as Fourth world nations. You will find many secessionist or self determination groups counted among macronations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also very easy to confuse micronations with those tiny nations that are recognized legitimately. These geographically small counties include countries such as Monaco, Fiji and San Marino. Micronations should not be confused with legitimately recognized, but geographically tiny nations such as Fiji, Monaco, and San Marino, for which the term microstate is more accurate and descriptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this book you will read about:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
* Overview and introduction&lt;/br&gt;
* Categories of Micronations&lt;/br&gt;
* List of Small Microstates&lt;/br&gt;
* List of Physical Micronations&lt;/br&gt;
* Top Ten Out of the Ordinary Micronations&lt;/br&gt;
* The Most Famous Micronations&lt;/br&gt;
* The Newest Kids on the Block&lt;/br&gt;
* How You Can Start Your Own Micronation&lt;/br&gt;" />
