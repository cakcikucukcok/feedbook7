  <title>Jealousy Is Crueler Than the Grave - Clifton Edwards Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The last of three siblings birthed by
Clifton and Frances Edwards Sr. on July
12th 1962, Clifton Edwards, Jr., entry
into this world was challenging. Born
with the German Measles coupled with
a temperature of 103 degrees, he entered
this world with a prophecy from an old
German Physician who proclaimed: This
is going to be a great man someday.
Clifton is a gifted songwriter, composer and producer. He currently pastors
Dunamis Temple Church in Jacksonville, Florida. He is a conference speaker and
an anointed teacher of Gods word. With his 20 years of pastoring, 35 years of
preaching and countless hours spent with parishioners who possessed a plethora
of wounds by the hands of others, Mr. Edwards shares with us something that
everyone deals with, but very few talk about, Jealousy. This book is packed
with spiritual incite and psychological axioms that will nourish the soul. May this
labor of love minister to all who have suffered at the hand of the people who were
infected with Jealousy. Let the healing began!" />
