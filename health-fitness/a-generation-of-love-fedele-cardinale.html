  <title>A Generation of Love - Fedele Cardinale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Does our personality originate in our mothers womb? Are our most ingrained fears set off by their heartbeat as we pick up their apprehensions and fears?   
This is a journey through Lorenzo Cardonas teenage years, plagued by a deeply entrenched insecurity; his fear of rejection; of being the eternal unwanted creature. His struggle to build an identity in the harsh reality of small village life, in the heart of the South Italian peninsula; where conformity is the verb. Lorenzos fear of rejection a close scrutiny of his recurrent childhood dream of drowning in dark agitated waters, appears to have its origin as far back as his mothers womb, as the love life of mother and son appear to be intertwined by a common destiny of emotional failure, in the apotheosis of the inescapable truth that there is no absconding from our biological fate, that our umbilical cord is eternal, nourishing us long after being severed.  
REVIEW  
A highly entertaining and witty novel - with universal appeal, where the supremacy of the love theme is mitigated by the light hearted tales of local myth, touching premises such as love, jealousy, gossip and senseless rivalry, served on a plate of typical and unique Mediterranean folklore told by the powerful voice of autobiographical narrative.
