  <title>From Hell to Inspired - Hilde Larsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After years of living with severe rheumatoid arthritis, Lyme disease, anxiety, and ulcers, Hilde Larsen finally decided she was done with hospitals, medications, and living a miserable existence. It was a choice that soon propelled her onto a lonely journey where she would courageously battle to not just overcome her physical challenges, but also to find her true purpose and a new beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she leads others through her journey from a total loss of health and vitality back to the life of her dreams, Larsen details her downward spiral triggered by processed foods, recurrent ulcers and stomach issues, chronic pain, and ultimately the diagnoses of rheumatoid arthritis and Lyme disease. Still, as Larsen reveals, she determinedly held onto hope and a message from an inner-voice that she could be healed and made a life-changing decision that would take her down a new path where she stopped the medications that masked her symptoms, transformed her diet, revisited and healed old wounds, and finally bid farewell to her old self and body. Through it all, Larsen demonstrates that even the greatest of challenges in life can be conquered with faith, perseverance, hope, and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From HELL to Inspired chronicles one womans incredible quest to free herself from an unhealthy existence, fulfill her dreams, and inspire others to take back their power.&lt;/p&gt;" />
