      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Seventy-six million baby boomers were born and are now aging. The medical industry from doctors to med spas to cosmetic companies have taken notice. There is so much confusion and false promises that this book addresses what and who is real and qualified for you to trust your looks, your health and indeed your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melvin L. Elson, M.D. is known world-wide as an expert in treating the appearance of aging. A graduate of Duke University School of Medicine, he also trained at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Duke Hospital. He has taught physicians and medical personnel in more than 52 countries and most of the US. He has published over 300 scientific articles, has written three books, has appeared on national and international television and has developed a number of skin care lines. As a board-certified dermatologist, he has practiced in Nashville for more than 30 years, specializing in cosmetic dermatology and attracting patients from all over the world. &lt;em&gt;Skin Scam: Dying to be Beautiful&lt;/em&gt; details the causes of the appearance of aging as well as informing the consumer what is and what is not effective and what the pitfalls are when one begins to seek help in reversing the signs of aging. Melvin lives outside Nashville with Betty, his wife of over fifty years. They have two daughters and two grandsons.&lt;/p&gt;" />
