  <title>The True Heart of a Man - Hanalei Vierra Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="MEN: Keep Your Balls, and Open Your Heart to the Woman You Love!
Finally, a resource to learn how to strengthen your emotional connection with a woman in a way that can make sense to both of you. The True Heart of a Man takes you on an adventure into healthy masculinity that will rewire your knowledge of your emotional world, shatter cultural myths about what feels manly, and cultivate a deeper appreciation of your self-worth and personal integrity. 
With over 27 years of clinical experience working with men, Dr. Hanalei Vierras down-to-earth approach to 21st century masculine identity also offers unique insight about the emotional honesty necessary to create a healthy intimate relationship, and how a True Heart connection with a woman is truly not possible if a man compromises his authenticity and self-respect. This book will guide you to:
 Identify your personal belief system about what masculinity means and evaluate all the ways it has shaped your identity both positively and negatively.
 Explore how your survival instinct shuts down your ability to create emotional intimacy with others.         
 Learn the importance of self-care  which is different than being self-centered  and all the ways youve been trained as a man to take care of everyone but yourself.
 Learn how to think and act more like a we than a me.
 Uncover the courage necessary to live a life of authenticity, personal integrity, and self-respect. 
The True Heart of a Man is a guided expedition toward personal transformation as you learn to explore and appreciate the value of your own True Heart." />
