  <title>Should My Child Play Aau Basketball? - Arlington R. Callies</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The content of the book seeks to address, discuss and resolve common issues encountered playing on a select sports team.  Its primary focus is on basketball and helping parents make the right decision as to whether or not to allow their child to specialize in one sport in pursue of scholarship or a dream of one day playing in the NBA (National Basketball Association).  The authors goal is to set the expectations for the parent and child that playing AAU basketball is fun and very entertaining but it requires time, energy, commitment and money.  Solutions and remedies are given to a common question most parents have such as, why doesnt the coach play my child more during the game? Another question of interest for most parents is the financial burden it appears to place on most families that include the cost of uniforms, tournament fees, food and travel and if its all worth pursuing every year! There is an entire chapter dedicated to searching and finding the right team for my child.  Another chapter focus on finding a coach that has my childs best interest in mind as a player and as person.  Its a book that every coach that coaches a select sport team should purchase and give their parents and require them to read before the season begins especially chapter 5.  Chapter 5 defines the parents role during the course of the season   making the games fun for everyone.  The book a great read for anyone that has a child playing on a select sports team." />
