  <title>Rhythm of Life - Jnanendu Majumdar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Over the years, right from young to old age, we all witness a sea of change in people, particularly from different generations and, hence, a shift in priorities of life and consequent value systems. But the basic emotional needs like peace, happiness, love, etc., still remain the same; and that, too, in all countries, through the means of getting them, have shifted to a great extent with a rapid change in lifestyle. Young people, including kids, these days often fall victim to situation and commit suicide, go through sudden separation/divorce, and also be violent and kill in extreme cases. The major strain nowadays is on all types of relationships like parents and children, husband and wife, lovers and friends, boss and subordinates, among colleagues, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The relationship between a woman and man, which is the primary base in life and that all look for, prompted the author to reflect and write life-like stories of four main couples in the backdrop of the narrators own, from different countries and social background and even with cultural differences. They come to know each other in person or over the Net, build a relationship, go through conflicts of interests; and some sustain and even enrich the relationship while some break away due to basic values of life. A relationship is not a deal; it is rather based on intrinsic values like understanding, adjustment, mutual respect, admiration of special qualities ( as each individual has), openness with clear communications, and above all, trust and responsibility enveloped in love. To sever a relationship, there should be enough courage and inner strength to uphold the principle of intrinsic values in our life without sweet coatings. All episodes provide some history and geographic background apart from sociopolitical aspects to understand the mould of each character and their characteristics, while all couples are beaded through the common string of &lt;em&gt;Rhythm of Life&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;" />
