  <title>Shaken but in Control - Paul Ciaravella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I believe that rain, snow, sun, and wind are miracles made from the dust of the earth. One day we are healthy, the next day we are not. In 2008 I was showing neurological signs of Parkinsons. I went to see my doctor, and she ordered an MRI. A few days after my MRI, I received a phone call from my doctor telling me that the MRI showed positive signs of Parkinsons. I went to follow up with my family doctor to create a plan for my future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symptoms I experienced in the early stages were: &lt;br /&gt;
 Difficulty writing&lt;br /&gt;
 Slow movement&lt;br /&gt;
 Softer voice&lt;br /&gt;
 Feet were heavy and difficult to move&lt;br /&gt;
 Hand tremors&lt;br /&gt;
 Poor balance when walking&lt;br /&gt;
 Drooling &lt;br /&gt;
 Always feeling cold&lt;br /&gt;
 Challenges with hand dexterity, making it difficult to peel fruit, put a letter in an envelope, hold a cup, dress, shave, and hold cutlery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I knew what was wrong with me, I was very frustrated. Once I was given the diagnosis and began seeing doctors, I was still frustrated. However, I didnt feel as if I were in the dark anymore.&lt;/p&gt;" />
