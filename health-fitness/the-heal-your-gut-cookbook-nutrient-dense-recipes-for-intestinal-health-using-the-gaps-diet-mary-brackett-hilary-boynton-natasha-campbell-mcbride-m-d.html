  <title>The Heal Your Gut Cookbook: Nutrient-Dense Recipes for Intestinal Health Using the GAPS Diet - Mary Brackett, Hilary Boynton, Natasha Campbell-McBride, M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With more than two hundred straightforward, nutrient-dense, and appealing recipes,&lt;em&gt; The Heal Your Gut Cookbook&lt;/em&gt; was created by GAPS Diet experts Hilary Boynton and Mary G. Brackett to help heal your gut and to manage the illnesses that stem from it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Developed by pioneering British MD Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride, who provides the book&#39;s Foreword, Gut and Psychology Syndrome (GAPS) refers to disorders, including ADD/ADHD, autism, addictions, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, stemming from or exacerbated by leaky gut and dysbiosis. GAPS also refers to chronic gut-related physical conditions, including celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes type one, and Crohn&#39;s disease, as well as asthma, eczema, allergies, thyroid disorders, and more. An evolution of the Specific Carbohydrate Diet, the GAPS Diet will appeal to followers of the Paleo Diet, who are still struggling for optimum health, as well as anyone interested in the health benefits of fermentation or the Weston A. Price approach to nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Heal Your Gut Cookbook&lt;/em&gt;, readers will learn about the key cooking techniques and ingredients that form the backbone of the GAPS Diet: working with stocks and broths, soaking nuts and seeds, using coconut, and culturing raw dairy. The authors offer encouraging, real-life perspectives on the life-changing improvements to the health of their families by following this challenging, but powerful, diet.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The GAPS Diet is designed to restore the balance between beneficial and pathogenic intestinal bacteria and seal the gut through the elimination of grains, processed foods, and refined sugars and the carefully sequenced reintroduction of nutrient-dense foods, including bone broths, raw cultured dairy, certain fermented vegetables, organic pastured eggs, organ meats, and more.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Heal Your Gut Cookbook&lt;/em&gt; is a must-have if you are following the GAPS Diet, considering the GAPS Diet, or simply looking to improve your digestive health and-by extension-your physical and mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;" />
