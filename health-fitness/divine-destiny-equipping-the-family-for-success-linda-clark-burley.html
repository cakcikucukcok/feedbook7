      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is designed to let the reader know that God created the institution of marriage between a man and a woman. It is a gift ordained by God. I believe that God has given me a message for such a time as this, to inspire couples with necessary knowledge they need, to equip and arm them with the needed tools to resolve chaos in the midst of conflict. I offer hope to marriages on the brink of disaster. I give biblical insight to Gods views concerning these issues. I also share some of my personal experiences as a young victim of an abusive husband and mother trying to raise a family. I share with the reader my hardships and triumph. My purpose is to equip couples with the needed tools to achieve a healthy family environment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
