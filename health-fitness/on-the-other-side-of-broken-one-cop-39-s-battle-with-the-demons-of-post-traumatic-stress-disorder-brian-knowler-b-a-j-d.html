  <title>On the Other Side of Broken - One Cop&#39;s Battle With the Demons of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder - Brian Knowler, B.A., J.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2004, Brian Knowler was the first police officer at the scene of a fatal collision. The driver who died was a close friend of Brian&#39;s and died while Brian was attempting to save his life.   For 8 years, Brian hid the physical and psychological effects of that evening while his personal and professional life crashed around him. In 2012, he finally admitted that he had a problem and was diagnosed with PTSD. In the years since then, he has regained control of his life.   This book is the story of Brian&#39;s journey from the fateful night of his friend&#39;s death to a place where he can now tell the tale of his descent into blackness, and his climb back, with complete candor and honesty.  The book includes a chapter written by Brian&#39;s wife on her experience as a proud police wife watching her husband turn into a man she didn&#39;t recognize, only to get him back after battling by his side to heal and rebuild.  It is a story of one man&#39;s, one family&#39;s, journey from darkness to the other side of broken." />
