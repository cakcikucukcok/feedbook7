  <title>Longer and Better Living with Homecare Benefits from Long Term Care Insurance - Richard G. Lazar PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is loaded with information that most people don&amp;#39;t know or don&amp;#39;t want to know when they are &amp;quot;now young - soon to be old&amp;quot; group. For others it&amp;#39;s too late to do anything about it. They are people who know it&amp;#39;s coming and hate to face the reality for themselves, their parents and their spouses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is also a plea to insurance companies who do not yet offer a sufficient amount of affordable, long-term, healthcare insurance. Thankfully, people have been sold long-term care policies by brokers and agents who care about them. These people get sold on the wisdom to set aside portions of their best income-generating years in order to give them choices in the later years. When needed, this choice enables people to use the benefits for in-home care or institutional living. In most cases it is only available to people with adequate long-term care insurance. Home is the best place for most senior people." />
