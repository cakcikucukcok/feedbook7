      <meta name="description" content="Our life story from this day forward doesnt have to mimic the pain of our past. Men and women who are equipped and empowered to revise the narration of past-life incidents can learn to narrate a story of joy, confidence, and hope as life unfolds.
The characters that share our daily stage may add drama, humor, and sometimes even horror to our life stories, but we dont have to be at their mercy. Acknowledging the roles of others, learning how to draw healthy boundaries, and knowing the value and benefits of inviting these characters to play a significant role in our story can lead to living out a rich and rewarding story line. Our lives are not an accident. Instead, we encounter incidents on a daily basis that can often be quite unexpected and unnerving. But shifting our paradigm about these happenings from accidental to incidental can open our hearts and minds to great opportunities. Daily, we are faced with many decisions to be a victim or live in victory. Which will you choose?" />
