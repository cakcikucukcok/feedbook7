  <title>Rapid Ex Back - Saintkenz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;nbsp;Rapid Ex Back, was designed to provide you with an understanding of why and how couples everyday rekindle their love.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll learn:&lt;br /&gt;
A)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Meaning of a breakup&lt;br /&gt;
B)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Breakup a cry for help&lt;br /&gt;
C)&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The sub-conscious attraction still exists&lt;br /&gt;
A)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Meaning of a Breakup&lt;br /&gt;
A breakup signifies a rejection.&amp;nbsp; However, it&amp;rsquo;s not the type of rejection most people think.&amp;nbsp; Our misinterpretation of a &amp;ldquo;breakup rejection&amp;rdquo; often lowers our self-confidence making our ego feel bruised and battered.&lt;br /&gt;
When someone breaks up with us we incorrectly assume that we were the ones being rejected.&amp;nbsp; Nothing could be further from the truth.&amp;nbsp; A breakup is not a rejection of YOU, but a rejection of how the two of you INTERACTED with each other in your relationship.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
If a breakup signified a personal rejection, nobody would ever get back together; however, every day hundreds of couples rekindle their love.&amp;nbsp; This happens because they resolve their INTERACTION ISSUES.&amp;nbsp; They simply got better at communicating and respecting each other&amp;#39;s need.&lt;br /&gt;
The same holds true if the breakup was caused, because one partner cheated.&lt;br /&gt;
Our misinterpretation of a &amp;quot;breakup rejection&amp;quot; leads us to miscalculate our actual chance of getting back together with our ex.&amp;nbsp; The fact is, most relationships can be rekindled if we just took a little time to learn a few key facts about why people break up.&lt;br /&gt;
All relationships experience interaction gridlock, some more often than others.&amp;nbsp; What determines success from failure is your ability to learn from each gridlock and adjust to each other&amp;#39;s need.&lt;br /&gt;

First Step to Get My EX Back&lt;br /&gt;
The First Step to Get My Ex Back can easily be implemented.&amp;nbsp; You must stop all the destructive behaviors that drive your ex away.&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll learn:&lt;br /&gt;
A)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Most Destructive Action&lt;br /&gt;
B)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; How to Close the Open Wound&lt;br /&gt;
C)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 8 Destructive Behaviors to Avoid&lt;br /&gt;
A)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; MOST DESTRUCTIVE ACTION&lt;br /&gt;
A break up can come as a surprise or something you expected.&amp;nbsp; It can be short and sweet or evolve into a long drawn out affair.&amp;nbsp; Regardless of the situation when the person we love, wants out of our life, we feel rejected.&lt;br /&gt;
However, our ego does not handle rejection well.&amp;nbsp; It will immediately try to restore the lost self-confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
The most common way people deal with a &amp;ldquo;breakup rejection&amp;quot; is to find another partner for a one night stand.&amp;nbsp; In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s so common we call it, &amp;quot;rebound&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; A &amp;quot;rebound&amp;quot; partner temporarily restores our feeling of acceptance, which we lost when our ex broke up.&lt;br /&gt;
However, being with another partner shortly after a breakup only complicates an already difficult situation.&amp;nbsp; This is especially true if all you really want is your ex back.&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes our emotional need, to restore what we lost, gets so overwhelming that our actions become counter-intuitive to our goal.&amp;nbsp; We can literally crush all our chances of getting our ex back because of the way we behave." />
