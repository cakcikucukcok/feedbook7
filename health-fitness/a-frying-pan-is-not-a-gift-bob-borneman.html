  <title>A Frying Pan Is Not a Gift - Bob Borneman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is a big difference between wisdom and knowledge.  Knowledge is what you get from reading books, going to school (if you stay awake) and touching the stove to see if it is hot, even though it is glowing red.   Wisdom is correctly answering the question from your wife honey, do these jeans make my butt look big?  If you have not yet attained wisdom, the answer to this question is not no honey, it aint the jeans; its that bag of Oreos you ate last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the average marriage only lasts 8 years, I feel blessed to still be married to the same person for 32 years (and counting).  Both my parents and my wifes parents never divorced.  I do recall my father in-law stating on the occasion of his 50th wedding anniversary I have never considered divorce, murder possibly, but never divorce.  Humor runs deep and wide throughout our family.  This book is written for the guys who are married, are getting married or think they want to be married, so they will not make some of the same mistakes I made when trying to learn how to be married.&lt;/p&gt;" />
