  <title>12 Secrets to a Miracle-Working Faith - Victor N. Alvarez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Victor N. Alvarez&lt;/p&gt; was fifteen when his family moved from Lima, Peru, to San Antonio, Texas in 1962. Comprehending little if any English when he arrived in the US, Victor taught himself to read, speak, and write English. Hard work and surefooted faith led to Victor earning bachelors degrees in psychology and Spanish from Thomas A. Edison College Newark, New Jersey in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The son of a pastor, and once a professor of homiletics at Mennonite Bible College in San Antonio, Texas, Victor himself has been an evangelist and a pastor for forty years. During that time, he has taught and preached about proper spirituality in many different lands and social settings: tents, jails, auditoriums, radio, and TV included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith is a favorite topic for Victor to lecture about. His book, &lt;em&gt;12 Secrets to a Miracle-Working Faith&lt;/em&gt;, has been composed for the purpose of aiding anyone who wants to improve their ability to receive miracles from God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
