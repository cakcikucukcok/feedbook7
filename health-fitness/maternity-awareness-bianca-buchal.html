  <title>Maternity Awareness - Bianca Buchal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is a place where the passing of time&lt;br /&gt;
is not determined by the ticking of the clock,&lt;br /&gt;
but by the beating of the heart&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A book for parents who feel invested with a sacred role, in which the child-mother-father triad represents the keystone for the creation of a new world.&lt;br /&gt;
Life before birth is the heart and core of this book.&lt;br /&gt;
The child takes shape in the love of the mother and the father; it feeds on food but also on external stimuli, such as music, colours, blessings, caresses, the voice of mum and dad... that will leave an everlasting mark.&lt;br /&gt;
From loving conception to childbirth, perceived as a moment of health, growth and development, this book will accompany future parents in the rediscovery of an ancient experiential knowledge, which is renewed in the simple and profound teachings of a universal Mother.&lt;br /&gt;
In this book you will learn:&lt;br /&gt;
- &amp;nbsp;What becoming a parent means;&lt;br /&gt;
- &amp;nbsp;How to deal with challenges that may arise during pregnancy;&lt;br /&gt;
- &amp;nbsp;Which diet to follow and how to nourish yourself;&lt;br /&gt;
- What the effects of smoking and alcohol are in pregnancy;&lt;br /&gt;
- How to deal with the pain of labour;&lt;br /&gt;
- The lotus birth, the natural birth, the birth in water, the&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; caesarean section.&lt;br /&gt;
