  <title>Hashimoto&#39;s Protocol - Izabella Wentz, PharmD.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instant #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Izabella Wentz, the author of the phenomenal &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;Hashimoto&amp;#8217;s Thyroiditis&lt;/em&gt;, returns with a long-awaited, groundbreaking prescription to reverse the symptoms of this serious autoimmune condition that is becoming one of the country&amp;#8217;s fastest growing diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than thirty-five million Americans currently suffer from Hashimoto&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8212;an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid gland and causes the body to attack its own cells. To alleviate the symptoms of this debilitating condition&amp;#8212;including chronic cough, acid reflux, IBS, allergies, chronic pain, hair loss, brain fog, and forgetfulness&amp;#8212;patients are often prescribed synthetic hormones that have numerous life-altering side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is a better way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosed with Hashimoto&amp;#8217;s at twenty-seven, pharmacist Dr. Izabella Wentz knows first-hand the effects of the disease, as well as the value&amp;#8212;and limitations&amp;#8212;of medication. The key to improved health, she argues, involves lifestyle interventions. In Hashimoto&amp;#8217;s Protocol, she outlines a proven treatment that has helped thousands heal and many others feel better&amp;#8212;in as fast as ninety days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on her own personal experience as well as her work consulting with thousands of patients, &lt;em&gt;Hashimoto&amp;#8217;s Protocol&lt;/em&gt; offers a practical pathway for healing and reversing the autoimmune damage at the root of the disease. The first step is a quick-start two-week detox that includes foods to eat and inflammatory foods to avoid, advice on supplements to support the liver, and an adrenal recovery plan. Next, readers create a personalized plan with foods, supplements, and other lifestyle interventions tailored to their body&amp;#8217;s own unique Hashimoto&amp;#8217;s triggers, which they can identify using self-tests included in the book. &lt;em&gt;Hashimoto&amp;#8217;s Protocol&lt;/em&gt; also features original recipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grounded in the latest science, &lt;em&gt;Hashimoto&amp;#8217;s Protocol&lt;/em&gt; is the first book to offer a proven protocol by an acknowledged expert in the field to treat this condition and help sufferers reclaim their lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
