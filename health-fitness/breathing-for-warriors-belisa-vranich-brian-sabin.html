  <title>Breathing for Warriors - Belisa Vranich, Brian Sabin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Belisa Vranich&#39;s ground-breaking second book teaches the science, techniques, and benefits of breathing correctly and efficiently for warriors in all walks of life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are less in touch with their bodies--and especially their breathing--than ever before. Ironically, athletes and others who pride themselves on taking care of their bodies actually put themselves at greater risk. Why? Because they&#39;re asking their body to take on next-level demands, but failing at life&#39;s most essential skill: efficient breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Proper breathing is the world&#39;s most powerful biohack. Learning it will help you feel better, avoid injury, and perform at your very best (including in bed!). Champion gladiators, master martial artists, even spearfishers all had one thing in common: efficient breathing to achieve flawless execution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An elite few still understand: Navy SEALs who need to make the perfect shot, super-elite weightlifters who truly understand how to harness and channel their energy, free-divers who can spend seemingly impossible amounts of time underwater, and high-profile execs who keep calm before multi-billion-dollar presentations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can learn their secrets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the corporate athlete to the tactical ninja, &lt;i&gt;Breathing for Warriors&lt;/i&gt; is a practical, science-forward book that focuses on everything related to breathing and performance--from muscles and workouts to an impenetrable inner game.&lt;/p&gt;" />
