The student does not know the successful route through high school. We are here to show him that success is possible, and now we expect it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Education is of low priority and the low scores are just the result of a greater symptom. While there is work to do at the state and national level, the real work is at the home level. We will address helping your student to communicate with the teacher, to understand the implications of fighting, and that practice is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join us in changing the results of education through this creative approach for understanding your student, creating an atmosphere of achievement, and building the foundation for a successful education and future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
