  <title>The Art of Passion - Shadrack Midenyo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In life I have discovered one great thing that pushes the will of human beings to go and do the impossible, and that is something called passion, and out of it, my thoughts ran wild, and my experience curved out truth about it all. And out of passion did I learn about this great ability that we all possess within us. And I learned how to use it, and I am still learning how to use it, and how it has helped me in my various walks of life. I have learned of its ways, of its hiding place, of its personality and of its character, and how it is to be compared with many other things that surrounds us in this life. Knowing about how to use your passions is perhaps one of the greatest achievements one can ever have, for with passion, you will find yourself elevated in places in your life you never thought you would ever reach. Enjoy this book, feed on its words, and remember it as long as you live, but most of all, I did not write this so you can just read it, I wrote it so that you can apply it in your life." />
