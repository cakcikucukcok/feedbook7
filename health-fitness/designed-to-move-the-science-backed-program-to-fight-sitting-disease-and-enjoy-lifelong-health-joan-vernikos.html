  <title>Designed to Move: The Science-Backed Program to Fight Sitting Disease and Enjoy Lifelong Health - Joan Vernikos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Science has proven that sitting too much is bad for your health, but what can you do about it if you&#39;re stuck at your desk all day? &quot;Designed to Move&quot; gives deskbound professionals a practical, easy-to-follow movement plan to fight the debilitating and life-shortening effects of sitting disease. Dr. Joan Vernikos, former director of NASA&#39;s Life Sciences Division, draws on decades of scientific research on astronauts to show readers how to use gravity-based movement to counteract the effects of prolonged sitting and maintain lifelong good health.  Written for everyone who spends most of their lives sitting in chairs, &quot;Designed to Move&quot; provides readers with a science-backed health program that helps people stay healthy while at work. Expanding upon her groundbreaking previous book, &quot;Sitting Kills, Moving Heals,&quot; Dr. Vernikos shows how developing simple new lifestyle habits at the office can reverse the symptoms of sitting disease and even aging itself, and lead to a life of bountiful health." />
