It is filled with practical, creative, effective, down-to-earth solutions to life&amp;#8217;s challenging problems.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;Michele Weiner-Davis, author of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Divorce Busting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 20th&amp;#160;anniversary edition of a self-help classic, updated with a new preface: Tapping into widespread popular interest in highly effective, short-term therapeutic approaches to personal problems, author Bill O&amp;#8217;Hanlon offers 10 Solution Keys to help you free yourself from &quot;analysis paralysis&quot; and quickly get unstuck from aggravating problems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tired of feeling stuck all the time when you&amp;#8217;re trying to solve a problem or are facing conflict? Do you get easily flustered or angry when a negative confrontation arises? Have you ever wished you could communicate more easily with your spouse, kids, colleagues, or anyone else you have a difference in opinion with? In this newly updated edition of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Do One Thing Different&lt;/em&gt;, Bill O&amp;#8217;Hanlon will arm you with his ten easy Solution Keys so that you can move quickly from &quot;stuck&quot; to &quot;smooth sailing&quot; in all aspects of your life. Humorous, direct, and&amp;#8212;most important of all&amp;#8212;effective, these keys will help you change how you view and &quot;do&quot; your problems&amp;#8212;from difficult relationships to enhancing sexuality and resolving conflicts of all kinds. The next time you have a problem, try one of these Solution Keys:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Break Problem Patterns: Change any one of what you usually do in the problem situation by doing one thing different! Example: If you usually get angry and defensive, sit quietly and listen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find and Use Solution Patterns: Import solutions from other situations where you felt competent. Examples: What do you know on the golf course that you forget when you get behind the wheel of your car? What do you say to resolve a problem with an angry customer that you don&#39;t say to your angry partner?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shift Your Attention: Focus on what you would like to have happen rather than on what is happening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grounded in therapeutic practice,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Do One Thing Different&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;will put you back in control of your emotions and your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
