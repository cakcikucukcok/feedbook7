  <title>Games of Make-Believe - Julie Ann Wambach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Julie Ann Wambach, an Arizona resident for fifty years, sets her new book, &lt;em&gt;Games of Make-Believe&lt;/em&gt;, in the early Phoenix, Arizona, area where the population by 1990 had grown by seven and half times of that in 1960. During these years, the explosive building boom and rapid cultural changes brought by an influx of diverse people from many other parts of the country imposed a heavy price tag on residents. For Dr. Wambach, a retired college professor whose early writings were primarily in the academic arena, this is her first work of fiction. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Amidst the 1960-1990 Phoenix transformation, the Prince family struggles to create what we now call a &amp;ldquo;blended family&amp;rdquo; before they ever heard the term. When a prosperous gentleman convinces her to marry him, Bella&amp;rsquo;s arduous existence suddenly holds the promise of enchantment. Thus begins twenty-eight stories, some in the style of a romantic fairytale, others of a comedy or a tragedy. Together, the stories explore the role of make-believe in a dysfunctional stepfamily trying to make sense of their lives in the changing community around them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the center of the family discord is the daughter who Bella&amp;rsquo;s husband brings into the marriage. Renata immediately rejects her new stepmother and two stepsisters. No one knows how to unify this group. As an adult survivor of child abuse, Bella struggles to create a convincing self-identity within her new husband&amp;rsquo;s affluent world. Her take-charge approach to running the family convinces others, but not herself. In an effort to make sense of it all, Bella latches onto a series of religions and pop psychologies, while her husband wholly devotes himself to the intense competition surrounding his flourishing home development business.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
