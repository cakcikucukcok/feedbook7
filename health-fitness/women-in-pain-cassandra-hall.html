  <title>Women in Pain - Cassandra Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="And the vessel that He made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter; so he made it again into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make (Jeremiah 18:4).
Women in Pain is a sequel to my first book, The Stages of Womanhood: Partnering with God to Birth His Will in Your Life. In birthing the will of God, pain is inevitable as it is in giving birth naturally. There is bound to be an oasis in the midst of every desert. This book helps the reader to find ones oasis in the midst of that painful event. The reader is helped to find that innate strength in order to push through and overcome the pain and come into the original will of God for ones life.
In this book, Women in Pain, Cassandra has unraveled the mystery surrounding physical and emotional pain when its presented to God and has highlighted how to hold on until change comes. Scriptures have been shared that will encourage women to look beyond the pain (Psalm 121:12) and look up to God, who is able to bring back to life the things that are dead in their lives. Cassandra has reminded us that storms do not rage forever. It stops at some point, and the sun shines again. I deem this book a healing manual indeed! Such an incredible insight not only for women; it is a must-read for everyone (Reverend Victoria Beecham)." />
