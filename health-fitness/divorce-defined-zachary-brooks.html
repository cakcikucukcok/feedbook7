  <title>Divorce: Defined - Zachary Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When your wife throws you out of the house, no one gives you an instruction manual. Youre officially on your own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zachary Brooks was once in that exact situationleft on the sidewalk like the trash. He felt alone, scared, helpless, and unsure what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His number one priority was maintaining a close relationship with his son. So many questions swirled through his head:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When will I be allowed to see my son again? &lt;br /&gt;What did I do to deserve this?&lt;br /&gt;What could happen next?&lt;br /&gt;How am I supposed to get through this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he went to the Internet and libraries to search for information, he found legal jargon and condescending rhetoric from lawyers, social workers, politicians and overly educated individuals who had never personally experienced the sheer brutality of a divorce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote this guide to help other dads better understand and manage the critical elements of their divorce while remaining a beacon of light in the lives of their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a divorced dad, while reading this book, I found myself relating to each story, each situation, and each feeling associated with the process of divorce. A book, such as this, would have benefited me immensely if it was released before or during my eviction. This is the person that you want to learn from.&lt;br /&gt;Seth Lerman, professor, author&lt;/p&gt;" />
