  <title>The Chariot Has Come - Donald R. Ware</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After many tries for conception, Callie was finally pregnant.  But early on in the pregnancy, she began to bleed and was about to lose the baby and possibly her life.  After being told by many Doctors at more affluent hospitals to abort the unseen child, she and her husband, Henry pushed on and found comfort and help in the County Hospital. They knew that if this baby did not come, there would be no other. She must have a hysterectomy to permanently stop her life threatening bleeding.  This would end any chance of future of natural motherhood, The baby Donald was born but developed polio at an early age ; yet he overcame that and became a professional dancer. He was raised in a poor neighborhood but conquered that to become a well-known doctor and change agent. He came back to his home only to be faced with opposition from doctors, a local hospital and one of the largest Hospital Corporations of its kind in the world. Along the way the Holy Spirit revealed itself in signs and wonders in his life to give him the victory over tyranny; for the benefit of all of us. 
This story is about victory against all odds.  It says that God is alive; is interested in the least of us; and will intervene in our lives for the good of all." />
