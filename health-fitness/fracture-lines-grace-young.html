  <title>Fracture Lines - Grace Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Grace Young believes that we are all warriors and miracles who, through various struggles and challenges, have each acquired fracture lines. With the hope of bringing peace, empowering women, and encouraging a movement that emphasizes inner strength, self-love, and courage, Young shares details of her amazing journey through life, during which she overcame seemingly insurmountable odds, learned to trust her power and find her voice, and eventually healed her own fracture lines.
Young begins by offering a glimpse into her chaotic childhood, overshadowed by a violent, alcoholic father whose unpredictable rages cast a dark cloud over a dysfunctional family situation. After her mother suddenly died and her father remarried, she quickly learned to trust her intuition in order to survive within a volatile home environment. Even after she was raped by an uncle at age seventeen, she somehow managed to pick herself up, attend college, and marrywithout any idea that soon life would once again test her strength.
Fracture Lines is the true story of one womans life experiences as she finds the power within to overcome her greatest challenges and define her destiny." />
