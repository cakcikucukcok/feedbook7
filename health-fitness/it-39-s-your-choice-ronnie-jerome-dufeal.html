You will experience a complete change of attitude. What you discover will amaze you. See life as youve never seen life before. Your self-esteem will dramatically increase. You like me will discover that your positive emotional feelings are a protective shield around you.  The natural laws and principles presented here will help you easily solve your problems. They will instill in you the energy of self-motivation. You will come to the awareness that what we do we do for the Experience of it. Your life is a reflection of your thoughts. You will attract people and things of your predominant thoughts, your strongest thoughts. 
You will realize that you can easily feel proud to own the person you are. Yes you can be proud of the person that is you. You will discover that it is much easier to do things when you are happy. Yes you can easily solve any problem you may have by discovering and applying these natural laws and principles. The book will help you so you could help yourself. The book will program new thoughts in you. Your new thoughts will enable you to do and have things you never thought possible for you. I ask of you two things as you start this journey. 
I ask that you read with an open mind and be honest and true to yourself. Have the courage to admit certain lack or shortcomings of yours to you. When you do you put yourself in a position to change you.  You may not understand or agree with everything in these pages but certain things will ring true. To believe someone or something is special you just have to continue to think they are special. People do just that in everyday life without being quite aware of it. As long as you continue to think they are special you will believe they are special. If you believe they are special you will treat them in special ways. The Breath Method takes away the pain. As you use the Breath Method you will come to later you will notice that it takes away emotional pain. There is a saying amongst teachers. Teachers said that repetition is the mother of retention. The repetition methods I have used in my books have proven to be very successful for retention of knowledge. As you go through the material you will discover this to be true. These laws and principles will make it easier for you to do and have anything you want including money." />
