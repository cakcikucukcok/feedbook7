  <title>Getting Over John Doe - Suzanne Yalof</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is there anything worse than being in love with someone who -- suddenly, out of the blue, with no reason at all -- stops loving you back?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a remedy for that all-too-familiar chapter in every girl&#39;s life: getting dumped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not really Ben &amp;#38; Jerry&#39;s that soothes the sting -- or getting even -- though that certainly helps. Rather, it&#39;s learning to lose him and respect yourself that puts you on the path to sanity-and gives you some Zen with men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this quirky romantic comedy of errors, Suzy Yalof tells her John Doe story from the pitch &quot;open -- minded, smart, funny&quot; to sex, the L-word, and the big dump (a subzero day on a chairlift) to finally getting over John Doe (Hint: Do the things he always hated). Like all of us, Suzy Yalof has survived the exaltation, embarrassment, and disappointment of romance. But with the realization that for every frog there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a prince, she&#39;s rebounded with style. Hers is an exemplary story of a woman scorned -- and then inspired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every woman who has ever loved and lost and then gone on to exhaust &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; mom, her pals, and the neighborhood bartender with her John Doe story will find a well of unconditional empathy in &lt;em&gt;Getting Over John Doe.&lt;/em&gt; It is a love lesson for our time -- and far more titillating than dating John ever was.&lt;/p&gt;" />
