  <title>When Your Doctor Has Bad News - Al B. Weir, Joni Eareckson Tada</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When the diagnosis is serious, what makes the difference between hope and despair?As a practicing oncologist, Dr. Al Weir works daily with patients who receive bad news. A medical doctor with a pastor’s heart, Dr. Weir knows from experience that it’s the patient’s focus, not the diagnosis, that indicates whether one will slip into despair and hopelessness or have the courage to live each day fully. Resilience of spirit can powerfully influence recovery and healing, and within our crisis, the choices we make are important. When Your Doctor Has Bad News offers no easy answers, no quick outs. But it does equip you to weather the storm you are facing and emerge whole again. Practical tips provide questions for you to ask your doctor and choices you can make to achieve your best chances for healing. Real-life stories show how others have coped with life-threatening illness, walked with God, and won. You can deepen communion with God in the midst of medical crisis. When Your Doctor Has Bad News gives you proven principles that will enable you to choose a life worth living, no matter what news the doctor has given you.  “Dr. Weir . . . guides the reader—especially the one who has received bad news—past the soul-numbing shock of a dismal medical report. He reminds us of the soothing comfort available in the Word of God, of the heartwarming precepts upon which we can build a new life, and of the simple steps a family can take to promote hope and healing.”—Joni Eareckson Tada (from the introduction)" />
