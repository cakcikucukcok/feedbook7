  <title>What We Don’T Understand About Relationships - Dr. Larry Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Keeping a relationship alive and successful can be immensely challenging in todays world. More often than not, relationships fail because the nucleus of the partnership has been based on selfish needs, desires, and purposes instead of spiritual truths. In his guidebook What We Dont Understand about Relationships, Dr. Larry Adams offers practical tips, Scriptures, and advice that will help anyone learn to apply Christian values and principles to their relationship, ultimately realizing a lasting and loving partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Adams, a biblical counselor and Bible teacher for nearly thirty years, relies on his education and the word of God as he carefully reexamines relationships from a spiritual perspective and reveals misunderstood truths about relationships and why they fail. By teaching concepts that relationships are not natural and should not be based on emotional or physical feelings, Dr. Adams introduces a fresh perspective that focuses on spiritual commitments, effective communication, forgiveness, and thinking of others first before ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What We Dont Understand about Relationships shares practical advice and applicable Scriptures that will help anyone struggling within a relationship to lay a new foundation based on seeking oneness with God first, and then each other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
