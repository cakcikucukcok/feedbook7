  <title>Testimonies of His Love - Lisa N. Aldridge - Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For years, I prayed for a closer walk with God.  My answer was the Scripture, to whom much is given, much is required.  Some may view this implied responsibility as a tempting invitation to become complacent, but I beg to differ.  In fact, I declared it as His Vision Statement for my family. Its Godly wisdom to get a vision and make it plain. Therefore, I knew it was a wise decision.
I wanted more of Him and no enemy in hell was going to stop me, and He knew it.   For this journey to be effective, The Flesh had to remain in restraints with the Holy Spirit in possession of the key. During the initial assignment, I quickly learned, there was No Room for Doubt.  At this level, He put an end to childs play or, as we refer to it as, the baby Christian stage, and opened the door to grown folks business.  Proper ID was required of me to enter this level, and upon entrance, per Him, my beauty would be my weapon and the words out of my mouth were His prophesy.  More often than I can recall, He sent me on special assignments that were to take place for, Forty Days and Forty Nights with very strict rules.  To activate each assignment, I had to, Heed, Discern and Respond to His voice. As I continued on my journey- and reached a point where I needed more, as promised, He blessed me with a fresh anointing along with an elevation in both the Spiritual and the natural.   
As you will see, God gave me specific directions to reach true intimacy with Him. As I share with you some of my journey, I invite you to take Him out the box and seek His intimate place and purpose for your life so that Hes able to give you specific instructions for your life as well." />
