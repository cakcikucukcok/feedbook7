  <title>Still in Bondage - James F. Plain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is not only a must read for children.  However, it can serve as a valuable source of information and reference for couples with children, and who may find value in its reference to parenting.
     Theres no myth in the fact that within the African-American community, a lack of education is responsible for it rapidly decaying. Without intervention, there is little hope in reversing the current trends plaguing these communities, and our nation. What affects a few of us, affects all of America. Thus, in order for us to move forward as a nation, we must come together for this great cause. For the benefit of all Americans, the ultimate goal should be to educate, re-direct, and uplift the African-American community.  
     Reading through chapter one The Pitfalls of the African-American Community, one can clearly see that it is rapidly decaying. For example; Black-on Black crime across America is rampant, out of control, and continues to be at an all-time high. In addition, the mass-incarceration of Black men continues to be disproportionate to that of other ethnic groups across America. 
     Chapter four offers valuable information pertaining to career planning.  Like education, career planning is a valuable component of success, and is the key to realizing the American dream.
     Couples who may be contemplating marriage will find value in chapter five The Financial Challenges of Marriage and in chapter six The Essence of Marital Reciprocity. 
     Chapter seven reveals why ethnic loyalty is of the essence in the African-American community. While it emphasizes marrying someone of your own ethnic identity, it does not advocate alienation or separation. 
     Chapter eight, Emancipation though Education, is included as a solution toward reversing the negative effects of black on black crime and subsequent, incarceration related to crimes such as drug dealing, bank robberies and other incriminating offenses." />
