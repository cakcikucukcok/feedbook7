  <title>The Healing Power of Self Love - Oscar Bamwebaze Bamuhigire</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the field of alcoholism and drug addiction treatment, there have always been questions for which there were no satisfactory answers: Is substance abuse a problem of discipline or a disease? Why is it that most alcoholics/ drug addicts do not seek for, or receive treatment? Why is it that only 5- 10% of alcoholics/ drug addicts respond to treatment? Why do untreated addicts have a better chance at breaking the bond of addiction than addicts who get treated? Why has the incidence of recovery without the help of formal treatment continued to rise? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Are the successes of Alcoholics Anonymous (A.A) nothing more than spontaneous remission? Why are some people able to quit their addiction without treatment, while others only get worse after treatment? Why does treatment have a negative effect? Why are some treatment programs more effective than others? Why has the world continued to experience a steady increase in the rate of addiction and self destruction? Why is it that 1 in 2 Americans has a diagnosable mental disorder each year, and 81 Americans commit suicide every day? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Why do non-Hispanic blacks bear a disproportionate burden of disease, injury, death, and disability? Why do the most successful treatment programs for addicts have a spiritual component? Why do non white people suffer from a high rate of substance abuse and self destruction? Why does Africa have the highest rate of suicide, poverty, and disease in the world? Why are some treatment programs more effective than others? Etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In a unique blend of psychology, psychiatry, metaphysics, medicine, orient and western religions, The Healing Power of Self Love provides answers to these and many more questions. In making its revolutionary contribution to the scientific world, it also explains how addicts can enhance their chances of recovery from addiction through the treatment programs of their choice, by utilizing the ancient tools of discipline, lateral thinking, and insight from the life experiences of the worlds greatest leaders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Even though this book was initially designed to meet the needs of alcoholics and drug addicts in treatment, it may be of great value to people who are struggling with other types of addiction, and to those who are faced with major obstacles to their self-realization or self actualization." />
