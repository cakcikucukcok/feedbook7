From author&amp;rsquo;s examples of her innovations readers will learn: how to create innovations; how to solve business and personal problems; how to understand 3 types of economies: market, planning, and mixed; capture what capitalism, socialism, and communism are; how to calculate interest earned on money; how to look at the messengers; that nothing happened by an accident, there is a reason for that; and how skills are transferable from one industry to another.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Innovations are not designed in a vacuum. They are functions of the outside world, such as economical and political environments inside the USA and in the world. To solve any problem, 1st, one must &amp;ldquo;look through the window&amp;rdquo; to see what is going on outside&amp;mdash;another skill introduced in this book.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sadly, today&amp;rsquo;s generation is oblivious to the outside world. &amp;ldquo;Doped&amp;rdquo; on social media, texting, &lt;em&gt;Dancing with the Stars,&lt;/em&gt; and the Kardashians, they lack the skills needed to survive, solve problems, and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The author would like to see this tragic trend reversed. She challenges readers to differentiate between true knowledge and the fluff of social media and to choose what information, skills, and knowledge they need to put into their brains&amp;rsquo; databases to help them navigate this challenging, unstable, and changing world and to better run their lives and the country.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Books by Alla P.
