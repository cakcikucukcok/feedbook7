  <title>Fitness, Health &amp; Longevity a Personal Journey - Frank Manganella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="FITNESS, HEALTH AND LONGEVITY A Personal Journey is my story about the passion I have for fitness and exercise and to provide information that I feel is useful in todays fast pace world. Its more than illustrations and descriptions of exercises. Its my desire to share the amazing changes that happen to people, not just physically but emotionally and spiritually as well. 
From witnessing teenage high school students experience, for the first time, their strength potential, to those who are middle age on the edge of becoming a candidate for requiring prescription medication to needing no medication at all, and finally seniors who were fragile become fit, energetic and agile is so extremely motivation that I became inspired to undertake this project and share it with you. 
FITNESS, HEALTH AND LONGEVITY A Personal Journey takes you into my life as a personal trainer, strength and conditioning coach, and a person whose life changed dramatically once my calling was realized and fulfilled. I share my discovery that because we all are body, mind and spirit, you too can expect dramatic changes in your life. 
Time to sit back, relax and enjoy reading this book. Then check with your health care provider, get up off your backside, start moving, and enjoy your personal journey to fitness, health and longevity." />
