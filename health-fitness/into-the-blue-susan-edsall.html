The doctors told Susan the best her family could hope for was that he would learn to play checkers. Susan knew if her dad couldn&#39;t fly, he&#39;d just as soon not breathe, so she chose another path. Battling the pessimistic conclusion of the experts---and her own looming fears---she and her sister, Sharon, aka the Blister Sisters, decided to take matters into their own hands. With no medical training but double doses of determination, they bushwhacked their own rehab program and got their father back behind the controls of his beloved open-cockpit biplane and into the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susan Edsall&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Into the Blue&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful family memoir about two feisty sisters from Montana who bring their father back to life---and discover themselves in the process. Inspiring, gritty, and often hilarious, it&#39;s also the story of anyone who has ever fought back from a dire prognosis to pursue a cherished dream.&lt;/p&gt;" />
