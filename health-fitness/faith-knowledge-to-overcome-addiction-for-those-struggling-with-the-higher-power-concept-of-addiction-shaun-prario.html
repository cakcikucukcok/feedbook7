  <title>Faith &amp; Knowledge To Overcome Addiction For Those Struggling With The Higher-Power Concept Of Addiction - Shaun Prario</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For the addict who needs another to identify with, who has been involved in the deepest levels of the life-style. This book&#39;s a transcendant experience over other programs or any other available reading material. One needs to have wisdom in all areas of this world we live in, so life for them becomes manageable, and they can succeed in properly helping others. Many people are also turned off by the idea of a Higher-Power, or struggle to put it to use, for good in their lives. However, the Higher-Power concept has never been explained and promoted in such a way, as in this book. This piece of literature supplies a great multitude of topics, and is far more than just a book for addicts, or Christians. It&#39;s meant to deliver assistance, and important awareness towards historic and modern sociology. Our ultimate goal&#39;s receive salvation, however, we beseech the Kingdom of God whence on Earth as well. Therefore, no longer will the antichrist operate by covert means &amp; cause harm: because nobody, can hide from ? Him." />
