  <title>Unexpected Family: A Life Saved - A Life Redeemed - Bette Noble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mom!&amp;quot; The urgency in the young man&amp;#39;s voice awakened Bette from a deep sleep. The dream was so vivid that it prompted Bette to pray, &amp;quot;Lord, help my son, please help my son,&amp;quot; not knowing which of her sons was in need of prayer. This cry for help ushered in the most dramatic season of Bette&amp;#39;s life, as the Lord orchestrated a reunion with the son she had placed for adoption at birth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Forty years earlier, Bette was a single graduate student with a crisis pregnancy. Her desperation led her to two abortion attempts and an emergency delivery at six months. With no way to care for a baby, Bette placed him for adoption. She returned to her studies and went on with her life, eventually marrying and having two sons. Yet, she always wondered what had happened to that tiny baby.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Four days after her dream and call to prayer, Bette received a life-changing phone call. &amp;quot;Hello, my name is Michael Moore. I have a personal matter I would like to discuss with you dating all the way back to 1970. I&amp;#39;ve been trying to find my birth mother, and your name turned up in my search.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With her world up-ended, Bette consulted with her husband and a friend who had recently experienced a similar reunion with the granddaughter she had never met. Through their advice and much prayer, Bette summoned the courage to talk with Michael about his birth and discovered that indeed, this was her son.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Michael had been born three months premature and was adopted at three months of age. Amazingly, he had survived his mother&amp;#39;s early first abortion attempt in which a possible twin was lost, the less than adequate nutrition his young mother had provided, along with&amp;nbsp;her drastic weight loss. The second abortion attempt had prompted his early delivery. Bette&amp;#39;s past experience in development disabilities testing had led her to fear severe mental and physical problems for the child. It was a miracle he had simply survived--much more amazing with his health, mental, and physical abilities all intact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When Bette and her husband agreed to meet with Michael and his family, she discovered that she had not only a son, but a daughter-in-law and three grandchildren. The children were eight-year-old twins - a boy and a girl - and a younger four-year-old son.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; With her family now reunited, Bette and her husband have been able to experience birthday parties for the children as well as attend school, church, and sporting events and other performances. Most remarkable of all have been the acceptance and developing relationship of Bette&amp;#39;s two sons with their unexpected older half-brother. They see Michael as someone they can trust with questions about relationships and spiritual matters as well as enjoy his companionship. This close relationship led her older son to invite Michael to be a groomsman in his wedding and for the children to be a part of the ceremony.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Unexpected Family is the story of a life saved and a life redeemed. You will be amazed by the many miracles that God performed during this remarkable journey of reconciliation and redemption, as He has indeed made beauty out of the ashes of the past.&lt;/p&gt;" />
