  <title>Cosmic Crossroad Countdown - Dr. Peter Hofmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Cosmic Crossroad Countdown, is both astronomical and historical - linking Gods time to mans time and joining a mysterious Fig Tree lesson to the Stars and to our prophetic generation.  Just as God used Daniel and the stars to point to His first coming, does it not make sense that He will again use Daniel and Stars to point to His next appearance! He has given us generational periods with their numerical sequences, a wise rabbi, a dragon and child, and a once-in-a-hundred-year Solar Eclipse to catch out attention. The Fig Tree riddle is the key to unlock a great mystery that every beating heart from every world view needs to unpack and understand quickly. It will illumine the cryptic Wheels of Time before it crosses the Divine Time-Line and shine a light on a 3500 year old debate concerning the cross in the wilderness.
The Divine foot print started thousands of years ago leaving measured Signs that we can follow if we study His-Story.  Dr. Hofmann will show how carefully our history is orchestrated with  two prophetical generational periods linking the past to the future, and the natural to the supernatural.   In the center is Jerusalem, the Holy of Holies, a LOST TIME mystery, and new beginnings.  Will we learn from Noahs time, when many scoffers perished, or will the wheel of time repeat itself because of a lie? If you do not decide, time will make the decision for you. This is a warning beacon to our Last Generation to investigate the truth,  solve the puzzle of the century and choose your path!  This is not date setting, it is putting everyone on notice that something big is on the way and God wants us to prepare. Just as the scribes and scholars missed the historic Sign 2000 years ago, most people will be uninformed unless they read this book." />
