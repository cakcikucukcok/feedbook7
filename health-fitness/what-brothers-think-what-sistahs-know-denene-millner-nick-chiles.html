  <title>What Brothers Think, What Sistahs Know - Denene Millner, Nick Chiles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the author of &lt;em&gt;The Sistahs&#39; Rules&lt;/em&gt; and her husband comes a &lt;em&gt;Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus&lt;/em&gt; for African Americans.Denene Millner&#39;s sassy, shrewd reaction to &lt;em&gt;The Rules&lt;/em&gt; became a bestseller. &lt;em&gt;The Sistahs&#39; Rules&lt;/em&gt; spent six months on the BlackBoard list. Then, proving the value of her own advice about dating and mating, Denene married Brother Mr. Right, Nick Chiles. Once she&#39;d laid claim to his heart, she took a really long look at his head to find out what his words and actions &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; meant. Together they decided to go boldly where few couples dare: inside the minds of a sistah and a brotha to reveal the real deal on what Black men think of commitment, monogamy, and other mysteries--and what sistahs know about staying true to themselves.&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Brothers Think, What Sistahs Know&lt;/em&gt; is the first book for African Americans that decodes the inscrutable ways of the opposite sex. In this funny, honest, provocative book, Millner and Chiles step across the great divide to create--once and for all--real understanding between sistahs and brothers. They give the real deal on:&lt;p&gt;* The perfect date&lt;br /&gt;* Why brothers think all sistahs are angry&lt;br /&gt;* Why so many men could run down Michael Johnson in an effort to escape commitment&lt;br /&gt;* Whether it&#39;s fair for sistahs to scream when brothers chase white girls&lt;br /&gt;* Why good sex matters&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Brothers Think, What Sistahs Know&lt;/em&gt; covers everything from first dates to lasting commitments, from myths and misunderstandings between brothas and sistahs to the kind of communication that fosters love &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; respect. It reveals, for the very first time, the motivations and fears coursing through that warm-blooded animal on the other side of the bed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
