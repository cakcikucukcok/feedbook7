Walker&#39;s illegal activities quickly incite chaos in the town and Lee Ann&#39;s marriage, leading to drastic transformations of beliefs, identities, and relationships.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Bev Magennis &lt;/B&gt;was born in Toronto, Ontario, and immigrated to the US in 1964. She received her MA in Art from the Claremont Graduate School, Claremont, California.
