  <title>The Most Beautiful Thing I’ve Seen - Lisa Gungor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lisa Gungor thought she knew her own story: small-town girl meets boy in college and they blissfully walk down the aisle into happily ever after. Their Christian faith was their lens and foundation for everything&amp;mdash;their marriage, their music, their dreams for the future. But as their dreams began to come true, she began to wonder if her religion was really representative of the &amp;lsquo;good news&amp;rsquo; she had been taught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She never expected the questions to lead as far as they did when her husband told her he no longer believed in God. The death of a friend, the unraveling of relationships and career, the loss of a worldview, and the birth of a baby girl with two heart defects all led Lisa to a tumultuous place; one of depression and despair. And it was there that her perspective on everything changed. &lt;em&gt;The Most Beautiful Thing I&amp;rsquo;ve Seen&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of what can happen when you dare to let go of what you think to be true; to shift the kaleidoscope and see new colors and dimension by way of broken pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisa&amp;rsquo;s eloquent, soul-stirring memoir brings you to a music stage before thousands of fans and a front porch where two people whisper words that scare them to the core. It is the story of how doubt can spark the beginning of deeper faith; how a baby born with a broken heart can bring love and healing to the hearts of many, and ultimately, how the hardest experience in life often ends up saving us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
