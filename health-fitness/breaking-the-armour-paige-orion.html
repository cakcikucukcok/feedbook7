  <title>Breaking the Armour - Paige Orion</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered what life really is all about? Why bad things happen to good people? Is there really a spiritual realm guiding us on our life journey? This book may help answer these questions and more. It contains suggestions on ways to heal yourself from any painful, past experiences, and how to view life from different perspectives. This book aims to show you that you are the creator in your own life, and how to start creating the life that you are meant to live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paige Orion will take you on her own journey of healing and growing out of adversity, in hopes that, through her experiences, you can learn, grow, andmost importantlyheal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The concepts in this book are life-changing. Read it with an open mind and heart and youll find that each seed that is planted will grow with little effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John. C., general manager/partner of Vector Communications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Breaking the Armour&lt;/i&gt; was amazing and beneficial in so many ways. It has taught me that every action has a reaction, whether positive or negative. It has helped me open up to understand why certain things occur in my life, and how I can work to change them. I was apprehensive in the beginning, but learning that my outcomes are up to me has helped me for the better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenna. O. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; So much wisdom is being shared. So many aha moments! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorinne B., spiritual therapist at Joyous Me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Upon reading this book, I, too, am learning to embrace the spiritual part of my life. I see how we all have this within us and that its not just for some people. I learned that life is what you make it to be. The tools in the back of the book seem so easy to do and once I started doing them, they have become powerful healing techniques. &lt;/p&gt;
