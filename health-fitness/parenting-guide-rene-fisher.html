  <title>Parenting Guide - Rene Fisher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book 1: Learn from an experienced parent and deep thinker how to improve your parenting skills. You must be doing a lot right already, and parenting is not an easy job, but with the relationship rewards and the fulfilment countless individuals have pointed at, it&amp;rsquo;s worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many parents have been puzzled over boundaries, time management, and control. If you jump into parenting without any foreknowledge, or you base all your assumptions and patterns on what your parents taught you, you&amp;rsquo;re bound to make some mistakes. Nobody is perfect, but some mistakes can be avoided by reading about what others have done and how that worked out for them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
You will read about things like:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How to plan,&amp;nbsp; reward, prioritize, and evaluate your time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Becoming better at multi-tasking, controlling emotions, and managing your finances while raising children.&lt;br /&gt;
Ways to set healthy boundaries, make them clean up their rooms, or eliminate distractions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Terrible mistakes the author has seen parents make, with all the inevitable consequences that came with those mistakes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
How being too controlling, having no bedtimes inconsistency, or bad nutrition make all the difference in what your children feel and how they behave.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Things that children said they loved most about their parents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The value of a functioning father in the home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
How super dads can think of games, use their imagination, and spark new life into their discouraged children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Thoughts on role models, fatherhood and mentioned cases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Book 2: The population has been on a decline in many areas in the world. People seem to shy away from parenting altogether. Many factors contribute to this, and in a spirit of research and analytical criticism, the author brings some of these aspects to light.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Following this careful examination, a compilation of new knowledge and reminding realities is brought forward by the same author, dealing with some of the most common dilemmas of parenting: How to talk to your children, how to get them to bed and stay there, and whether to be strict or lenient. With these fresh beliefs and keen observations, valuable lessons can be learned, such as:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How the average number of children per family is affecting the world economy.&lt;br /&gt;
How important it is to decide to have a baby and which factors to take into account when you do.&lt;br /&gt;
Why having children can be a joy and a fulfilling way to live your life.&lt;br /&gt;
The best ways to give your children compliments without saying the same things over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;
Insights about a child&amp;rsquo;s expectation and his or her attachment to the judgment of a caretaker or parent.&lt;br /&gt;
The difference between authoritative, authoritarian and permissive parenting styles.&lt;br /&gt;
How to decide on the best bedtime rituals to put your children to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;
The best ways to avoid a screaming, tantrum throwing toddler when they get tired.&lt;br /&gt;
Ideas about exercises, nutrition, and other elements that determine a child&amp;rsquo;s health.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book bundle will really take you to the other side of parenting with illustrated examples, funny anecdotes, horrifying mistakes, valuable insights, and wise advice. Don&amp;rsquo;t wait and get it now!" />
