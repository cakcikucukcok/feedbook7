  <title>Get Younger, Live Longer Naturally - Victor Resnick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When people turn over their forties or fifties, so many of us would love to be younger and live a long life. One can find million recommendations. Some of those are helpful, but neither one is fit for everybody. Why? Because of our aging process is individual, like age-related diseases. It depends on genetics, activities, environment, etc. So, each of us needs special rejuvenation program that might be updated from time to time. Instead of one &amp;ldquo;silver bullet&amp;rdquo;, the author suggests five ways of activity based on previous analysis. These are breathing exercise (most importunately), internal cleansing, contrast temperature, some new diet ideas, and special physical exercise. The first and last ones can be combinable. All that should be customized regarding gender, age, bodily composition, and other factors considered in the book. Also, some age-related diseases are considered as well from the point of preventing those, not how to cure them. If one would like to be in control of personal rejuvenation program the second chapter explains how different bodily systems are aging with the time, and what is affecting them. The last chapter is about how to build up your own rejuvenation program.&lt;/p&gt;" />
