  <title>Sit with It: the Truth Behind Weight Loss - Anders Grant Ms Rd Ldn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you are just looking for a quick fix, a magic pill, a wave-of-the wand transformation, lazy, or still calling food your comfort, or have a million excuses as to why you can not lose weight, this book is not for you. However, if you desire to be healthy and have a desire to face the truth about the real way, the hard way, the life-time committed way, to maintain a healthy weight, this book is for you. There are so many things in life out of our control, but we can start by taking control of our health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A book everyone will understand regardless of age, sex, or cultural background  Sredna, eldest daughter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Move over Dr. Phil......... Ms. Grant&#39;s forthright yet empathetic remarks about the challenges of weight loss were right on target. She provided realistic solutions to the challenges people face. She directs the reader to examine core beliefs and change those beliefs when appropriate. We are challenged to search for the &#39;why&#39; we eat. Her book was a delight and must have for the individual who wants to make healthy living a way of life.&quot; -- Susan R. McFadden, MS.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;This book lets you in on the REAL truth behind weight loss:  it&#39;s not just about losing weight, it&#39;s about gaining a healthy mind and spirit.  That way, the weight you lose stays lost and the insight you gain stays found!&quot;  Terra Walters" />
