  <title>Tested, Tried and Justified - James M.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Min. Matthew M. Gamble went through many trials and tribulations in his life. One being growing up in the church but living a life of homosexuality. He endured rejection and persecution, but through it all knew that there was a God who was a Deliverer. The Bible states, &quot; And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony.... &quot;Rev 12:11, and through it all God&#39;s Grace and Mercy kept him but always God&#39;s love accepted him. Losing a friend to street violence in 2007, he realized that life was short and he began making the choice to live for Christ. Know those who seek HIM find HIM and know that those, who seek HIM diligently, in faith, are rewarded. 
Tested, Tried and Justified, a title that was inspired by his wife CIjiGamble, is a self-help book that was written to help people know and understand that God is still able to do the unthinkable despite what others may think. After all the obstacles he realized that he had been Tested in the fire, Tried in the storm and now he could truly say that he was Justified by God." />
