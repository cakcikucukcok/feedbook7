      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From actress Sanaa Lathan to Georgia State Supreme Court chief justice Leah Ward Sears, many African-American women attribute much of their success to having a positive father figure &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Daughters of Men&lt;/em&gt;, author Rachel Vassel has compiled dozens of stunning photographs and compelling personal essays about African-American women and their fathers. Whether it&#39;s a father who mentors his daughter&#39;s artistic eye by taking her to cultural events or one who unwaveringly supports a risky career move, the fathers in this book each had his own unique and successful style of parenting. The first book to showcase the importance of the black father&#39;s impact on the accomplishments of his daughter, &lt;em&gt;Daughters of Men&lt;/em&gt; provides an intimate look at black fatherhood and the many ways fathers have a lasting impact on their daughters&#39; lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
