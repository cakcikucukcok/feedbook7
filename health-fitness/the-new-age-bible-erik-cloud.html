  <title>The New Age Bible - Erik Cloud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This magical literature full of religious logic, metaphysical common sense, and
supernatural wisdom has given way to a new astrological star chart reading
fashioned formidably from a keyed up individuals molded mind, body, and
soul all the while exposed to everyday occurrences such as light and dark, positive
and negative, genetics and environment, ECT. Th e key used for utility coded in our
modern day western zodiac, four basic elements, and three states confronts many
everyday problems such as health, money, love, and self-defense in an importable
composition for all to use. Can modern day literature do what the literature from
our past has done? Th e overall Biblical character and feel consisting of many numbers
combined with letters is very similar to our current Holy Scriptures and is here to
help with economic and weather conditions. Th is coupled with scientifi c prediction
in cognition helping to understand the immediate present by reviewing our past
history by providing eff ective future caliber predictions on both micro and macro
levels in our lifetimes through the areoles of time in universal form lending to Ages
similar to time travel. Could philosophical genius occult practices be construed and
accepted as more than dogmatic science fi ction and/or fantasy and on to fashioned
fi ndings from omnipresent God and science itself? Why not let your qualities defi ne
you whatever they are? A higher state of conciseness would be the calling on to
uncharted places indeed! On to a more mentally focused atmosphere as opposed
to the current physical realms is where the book takes us through its profound
knowledge providing for a real time utopia! Th e precision of 1 and 365 odds (even
more when factored with the eastern zodiac) combined with the generality of 365 to
1 is very enticing existing in a perfect state laying somewhere in the zodiacs twelve
star signs using an ark key for utility coded within the four elements and three states!
It makes us rethink all that we have learned in our educations rounding conspiracy
theory by placing accepted God as more of a common factored force while not too
sexual, accidental, and humane!" />
