  <title>Parental Death - Michelle Shreeve</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to a recent U.S. census, approximately 2.5 million children under the age of eighteen have experienced the death of a parent. Losing a parent at such a young age can have devastating consequences. Beyond the grief children and young adults experience, they can be at risk for many negative outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms, as well as diminished self-esteem. Their academic success and relationships with others can also be adversely affected. For these young adults, help is not always easy to find. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Parental Death: The Ultimate Teen Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Michelle Shreeve offers a variety of ways in which young people can cope with this tough experience. In addition to outlining the universal difficulties of losing a parent, the author also points out the unique dynamics of specific losses--sons who lose fathers, daughters who lose mothers, sons who lose mothers, and daughters who lose fathers&amp;mdash;and what those losses can mean for their future development. This book also identifies how the challenges of life without a parent can affect a young adult at different stages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring real stories and quotes from teens about their experiences, this book shows young adults a variety of views about the death of a parent, and provides coping strategies that young people can call upon to help them through this difficulty. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Parental Death: The Ultimate Teen Guide &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;serves as a valuable resource for all teens, whether they are dealing with tragedy personally or are looking for ways to console friends or siblings. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
