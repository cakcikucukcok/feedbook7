  <title>Liquid Nutrition: The Complete Guide to Juicing for Good Health - Kristy Jenkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Juicing is more than a fad&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s an investment in your health&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Be Prepared&amp;rdquo; might sound a little cheesy, but it&amp;rsquo;s one of the best pieces of advice you&amp;rsquo;ll ever hear. You can never go wrong when you take a little time to prepare yourself for the future. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s bringing an umbrella with you on a cloudy day, keeping a pack of water bottles in your car or setting up a retirement plan, we all try to &amp;ldquo;be prepared&amp;rdquo; for the future in different ways.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But what are you doing to prepare for the future of your health?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This one is a little less obvious, since we can&amp;rsquo;t always predict how our bodies will change over time. Thankfully, juicing makes it easy to invest in your own future by ensuring that you eat a balanced diet full of all the essential nutrients for a long, happy life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The information inside Liquid Nutrition: The Complete Guide to Juicing for Good Healthexplains why fruits and vegetables are so important, and how eat the right amount by juicing them. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple process that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require spending a ton of money or following complicated instructions, so you can start eating more healthfully in no time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Creating a balanced diet is about more than just eating more vegetables and cutting down on processed foods. It&amp;rsquo;s about ensuring that you eat a variety of foods in the right quantities so that you get the perfect amount of nutrients for your body. A huge&amp;mdash;and often overlooked&amp;mdash;part of this is making sure you don&amp;rsquo;t eat too much of any food or get too much of any nutrient.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every day that you replenish the minerals and electrolytes lost during activity, you add another one onto your life. Juicing helps you introduce powerful antioxidants that can reduce the signs of aging, improve your immune system, and even lower your cholesterol. After just a few days of drinking fruit and vegetable juice, you&amp;rsquo;ll already feel healthier, stronger, and ready for whatever the future has in store." />
