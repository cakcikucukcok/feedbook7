  <title>I Will Not Be Broken - Jerry White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A guide to recreating a happy and fulfilling life after catastrophe strikes that Bob and Lee Woodruff call &quot;a road map for the individual and their family to re-enter the land of the living&quot;*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of a loved one, a painful divorce, or a serious physical injury---we must all, at one point, face tragedy---unavoidable moments that divide our lives into &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after.&quot; How do we muscle our way through tough times and emerge stronger, wiser---even grateful for our struggle? In 1984, author Jerry White lost his leg---and almost his life---in a landmine accident. He has endured the pain of loss and the challenge of rebuilding.  As cofounder of Survivors Corps, White has interviewed thousands of victims of tragedy.  With his book &lt;i&gt;I Will Not Be Broken&lt;/i&gt;, he shares what he has learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White outlines a very specific five-step program to coping with disaster; to achieving strength and hope; and to turning tragedy into triumph.  In their own words, his survivor friends and colleagues share their stories.  It&#39;s a group that includes the well known, like Lance Armstrong, Nelson Mandela, and the late Princess Diana, and also everyday survivors of death, loss, injury and heartbreak. Through their stories and the author&#39;s words, the book takes readers step-by-step through the process of not only surviving tragedy and victimhood, but going on to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Bob and Lee Woodruff, authors of &lt;i&gt;In an Instant&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
