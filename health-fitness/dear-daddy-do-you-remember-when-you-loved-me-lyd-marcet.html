  <title>Dear Daddy, Do You Remember When You Loved Me? - Lyd Marcet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=Profiles style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-tab-count: 1&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;I&gt;Dear Daddy, Do You Remember When You Love Me?&lt;/I&gt; chronicles the relationship between a father and daughter, which began as strong and as loving as a relationship ever could. As a little girl she always felt cherished and protected, knowing she was safe as long as he was there. She was his little princess. Life was full of love and laughter, fun filled days at the beach, and singing songs together in the car.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=Profiles style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-tab-count: 1&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;The relationship changed dramatically when, at thirteen, she made what he deemed an unforgivable mistake. Suddenly she was no longer daddys little princess, but rather someone he now simply seemed to tolerate, criticizing her and finding fault with everything she did. Feeling frightened and unprotected, she struggled with her new role in his life while self-doubt and insecurity overwhelmed every aspect of her life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=Profiles style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-tab-count: 1&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;After trying to fight her way out of the abyss for ten exhausting years, she received help from an unexpected source. She gained tremendous strength from this source and learned to live a fuller and richer life. Until one day when bad news struck, and she was plunged back into the darkness once more. &lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-tab-count: 1&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=Profiles style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-tab-count: 1&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;She found herself taking care of her father amidst many mixed emotions such as love, compassion, anger, and resentment, but mostly love. Her love was unconditional.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=Profiles style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-tab-count: 1&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;All she ever wanted from him was to hear the words, Im proud of you&lt;/P&gt;" />
