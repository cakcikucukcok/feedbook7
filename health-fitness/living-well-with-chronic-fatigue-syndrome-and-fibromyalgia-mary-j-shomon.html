  <title>Living Well with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia - Mary J. Shomon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the author of &lt;em&gt;Living Well With Hypothyroidism&lt;/em&gt;, a comprehensive guide to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia--vital help for the millions of people suffering from pain, fatigue, and sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent studies indicate that 3 to 6 million Americans suffer from fibromyalgia--a chronic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and multiple tender points. This terrible condition is often accompanied by chronic fatigue syndrome, a persistent and debilitating sense of exhaustion that is estimated to affect 800,000 Americans--twice the number of people with multiple sclerosis. Yet there are no official blood tests of diagnostic procedures that can confirm that yes, you definitely have these conditions, and in fact, a whole segment of the medical world doesn&#39;t even believe these two diseases actually exist. In addition, the few books that are on the market tend to focus on single solutions or eschew conventional and pharmaceutical approaches, which could alienate readers who use conventional medicine in whole or part. In her trademark accessible, easy-to-follow style, patient advocate Mary J. Shomon integrates the latest findings regarding these misunderstood conditions. Highlighting the pros and cons of the antibiotic, metabolic/endocrine, hormonal, musculoskeletal, and many other approaches to treatment, Shomon explores the fads and viable alternatives--both conventional and alternative--and provides helpful, clear solutions to help sufferers of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At various points since 1995, Mary J. Shomon has been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. Since then, she has transformed her health challenges into a mission as a nationally-known patient advocate. She has worked for more than 20 years in writing, advertising, public relations, and communications and is the founder and editor-in-chief of several thyroid, autoimmune, and nutrition newsletters, as well as the internet&#39;s most popular thyroid disease website, www.thyroid-info.com. &lt;/p&gt;" />
