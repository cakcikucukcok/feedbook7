  <title>Raw Food Life Force Energy - Natalia Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Looking for a whole new approach to weight loss, health, and beauty without necessarily going all raw or strictly vegetarian? Welcome to Raw Food Life Force Energy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to top nutritionist Natalia Rose, everyone is entitled to a beautiful lean body, youthful radiant skin, abundant energy, and a state of natural bliss. The secret is tapping into the ultimate source of well-being&amp;#8212;Life Force Energy. If we can properly harness and increase our Life Force Energy through simple dietary and environmental principles, and therefore cleanse and bring our bodies back to their natural, harmonious frequency, we can experience radically improved levels of health, beauty, and happiness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raw Food Life Force Energy&lt;/em&gt; is entirely compatible with the principles laid out in Rose&#39;s previous book, &lt;em&gt;The Raw Food Detox Diet&lt;/em&gt;, but presents her diet-lifestyle in an excitingly progressive framework that reminds us that we are not just physical bodies, but dynamic beings who thrive on harmonious high vibrations and Life Force Energy. Rose presents four fundamental energy principles and practical applications, leading us to the best sources of natural energy&amp;#8212;such as raw fruits and vegetables, sunlight, and fresh air, to name a few. These principles lay the groundwork for Rose&#39;s comprehensive 21-day program, followed by more than seventy original, mouthwatering recipes that range from healthful cooked fish dishes to raw vegetarian soups, entrees, and desserts to accommodate all levels of raw food energy dieters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rose offers a new vision of how to honor and revitalize our bodies and become powerfully attractive inside and out. &lt;em&gt;Raw Food Life Force Energy&lt;/em&gt; shows us how to break out of our destructive, energy-draining patterns of poor eating, unsuccessful dieting, and stressful living to lift ourselves to a whole new stratosphere of well-being.&lt;/p&gt;" />
