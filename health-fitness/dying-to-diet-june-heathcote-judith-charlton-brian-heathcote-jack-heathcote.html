  <title>Dying to Diet - June Heathcote, Judith Charlton, Brian Heathcote, Jack Heathcote</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
Obesity is the materialisation of a frightening internal struggle, and loss of control with your eating. It is a battle fought and lost with food each day. Being overweight is about being overwhelmed by food. Food has become the nurturing internal carer, a substitute parent which offers sustenance at a damaging price. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Compulsive eating, comfort eating, yo-yo dieting, mindless eating and eating to soothe stress, become the easy option in a desperate attempt to fill a vast emptiness inside that seems insatiable and has very little to do with hunger. Throughout childhood and the pressures of our environment we can lose sight of ourselves because of the need to find love and attachment in security. The secret of our true identity lies within the realms of the child within. Reaching that lost child and reclaiming that innocence and spontaneity will, I believe, take you towards your true self and then onto a journey of self care and self love which, although challenging gives new insights into how to manage around food.
