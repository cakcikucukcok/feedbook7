  <title>Where Angels Walked - Georgia Verble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Where Angels Walked&lt;/I&gt; is the story of Jenny Goolsby, a beautiful baby girl born with hemangioma.  Through her parents faith, the support and prayers of a loving family, husband, and community, and the strength of her spirit, Jenny overcomes physical limitations to achieve personal and business successes.  Most importantly, she reaches out to everyone with love, even in the midst of her own strife.  Although despair could have been Jennys story, she chose to pen her life with faithfaith bright and beautiful.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A unique challenge for its author, &lt;I&gt;Where Angels Walked&lt;/I&gt; chronicles the extraordinary defeats and triumphs of Jennys life, offering assurance and courage to those who have suffered with and lost a loved one.  Jenny demonstrates with her life that it is through weakness that Gods strength can shine through.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In riveting detail, Ms. Verble writes eloquently her memories of Jenny: girlhood pretending and playing; moments of utter despair and hopelessness; and Jennys persistence to live life fully time and time again. She describes how they helped each other in life; their marriages and the children they shared; the family dinners and gatherings; and the constant stream of the love that flowed between these special, angelic sisters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Tragically, Jennys life is shortened following a diagnosis of colon cancer.  Not only does the family lose their beloved sister; they lose Dewey, Jennys devoted and loving husband.  To add to this heartache, all of Jennys possessions are lost, never to be cherished by her family.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The combination of losing Jenny and what she created and worked for brought much sadness and grief to Georgia.  The author began writing to explain her heartaches and her personal journey from taking full responsibility for her sisters death to final complete acceptance of it.  After 10 years of writing, &lt;I&gt;Where Angels Walked&lt;/I&gt; has been published.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This emotionally compelling personal story raises many spiritual questions about life, illness, death, and finding peace in the midst of personal nightmares.  The pages are filled with detailed memories and the story contains laughter and surprise, suspense and drama, sorrow and pain; but most significant, the assurance of Gods steadfastness to his beloved children.  Ms. Verble gives freely of her memories, ideas, and feelings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Follow Jenny and Georgias journey from despair to joy, back to despair, and finally to joyful acceptance of Gods plan.  &lt;I&gt;Where Angels Walked&lt;/I&gt; is difficult to put down and impossible to forget.&lt;/P&gt;" />
