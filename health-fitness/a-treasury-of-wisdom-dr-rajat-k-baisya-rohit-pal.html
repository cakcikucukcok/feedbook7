  <title>A Treasury of Wisdom - Dr. Rajat K. Baisya, Rohit Pal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book contains on every page the wisdom of all nations, insights into the secrets of life, and a key to your success and happiness. Here is an exhaustive collection of quotable wisdoms from Lao Tse (570BC), Lord Buddha, and Socrates to the present (2015). It contains nearly 1,900 gems of art, wisdomm and humor from great thinkers, philosophers, poets, and worlds sharpest statesmen and sages. Proverbs signify the ocean of wisdoms of the universe. These are ineffaceable guides for the humanity. A collection of proverbs is, therefore, a good asset in the universal knowledge made available to the common men.
A special feature of this book is that its contents know no barriers; they transcend language, country, culture, and civilization. In fact, it represents the quintessence of the wisdom of ages from far and near. While it is useful to anyone interested in enriching the fund of knowledge and enlarging the frontiers of his understanding, it should prove an invaluable companion to young scholars, and therefore, I would specially recommend it to them.
All quotations and wise sayings have serially been numbered under suitable chapters for easy understanding. And some of these have been highlighted to draw the attention of readers towards these, which may be more relevant, useful, and applicable to solve our day-to-day problems.
The book acts like a medicine that relieves tension and brings peace of mind. It is an ideal gift of love for someone you love dearly." />
