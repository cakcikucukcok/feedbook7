  <title>I&#39;d Like To Call For Help But I Don&#39;t Know the Number - Abraham J. M.D. Twerski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you have to be religious to be spiritual? Can you have a spiritual life and not believe in God? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These and other profound questions are explored by Dr. Twerski in &lt;i&gt;I&#39;d Like To Call For Help But I Don&#39;t Know the Number: The Search for the Spirituality in Everyday Life&lt;/i&gt;. He shows us how to open ourselves up to the deeper aspects of our lives that are often obscured by concerns about success and material wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;True spiritual discovery, Dr. Twerski suggests, involves more than overcoming selfishness or dependency; it also requires a journey of self-improvement, character development, and respect for others. Inspired by the Alcoholics Anonymous groups he encountered in his clinical practice, Dr. Twerski outlines a twelve-step program for spiritual growth through self-awareness, service, and self-management. He illustrates his program throughout with true success stories he has witnessed over the years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Abe Twerski provides us with an understanding of our spiritual side . . . It&#39;s like a conversation with a warm and trusted friend.&quot; - Betty Ford&lt;/p&gt;" />
