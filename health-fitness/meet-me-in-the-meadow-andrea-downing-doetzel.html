  <title>Meet Me in the Meadow - Andrea Downing Doetzel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Meet me in St. Louis, then further south I ask you to travel with me past the Mississippi RIver town of Kimmswick to a valley along Glaize creek to my secret meadow.  As you Meet Me in the Meadow, I will tell my tales to you, Take a peek through time and history, some are fantasy, some true. 
A memory of my Great Grandmother before the the 1904 St. Louis World&#39;s Fair and her encounter with a Gypsy woman traveling through the area. Stories of hardships of my fathers pioneer grandparents as they settled their Homestead in Northern Missouri in the 1830&#39;s and kept a diary of the daily challenges. An August picnic a hundred years ago and the pictures I found. 
On to my own experiences as I lost a classmate in third grade. Some unique ways I look at things, and what types of foods entice me to the County Fair. As a dancer, my escape from a very rude gentleman visiting from Greece. My curiosities and certain circumstances in life.
In My Meadow, I describe the area where I found peace to write and where I made some eerie discoveries. Years of interest in archaeology are the subject of several narrative poems as I ventured througn the virgin woodlands along the creek. 
I am inviting you to Meet Me in the Meadow. Picture a warm Spring day as we sit together and I share my world of Adventure, Humor and Mystery." />
