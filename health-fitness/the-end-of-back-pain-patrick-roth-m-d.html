  <title>The End of Back Pain - Patrick Roth, M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Back pain manifests itself in many different forms, attacks without warning, and damages its victims&amp;#8217; physical and emotional health. Everyone suggests a different cure for the effects of a weak core: surgeons want to cut, chiropractors want to adjust, physical therapists want to perform physical therapy.&amp;#160; In &lt;em&gt;The End of Back Pain,&lt;/em&gt; neurosurgeon Patrick Roth, M.D., reveals that, more often than not, back pain is caused by a set of underdeveloped core muscles that control the stability and alignment of the spine that are not being used. He details a specialized exercise program to strengthen and develop those muscles to relieve, control, and even prevent chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The End of Back Pain&lt;/em&gt; helps patients view the body from a totally different perspective, and inspires readers to push their bodies in order to cure its maladies. After years of treating back pain, Dr. Roth has seen time and time again that a back that is not used to its full capacity is a back that is unhealthy. When we don&amp;#8217;t use our backs, we are not utilizing the core set of muscles designed to help us stay strong, increase stamina, and look our very best.&lt;/p&gt;" />
