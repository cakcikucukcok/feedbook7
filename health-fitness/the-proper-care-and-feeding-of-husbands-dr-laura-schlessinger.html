  <title>The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands - Dr. Laura Schlessinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In her most provocative book yet, Dr. Laura urgently reminds women that to take proper care of their husbands is to ensure themselves the happiness and satisfaction they yearn for in marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women want to be in love, get married, and live happily ever after. Yet disrespect for men and disregard for the value, feelings, and needs of husbands has fast become the standard for male-female relations in America. Those two attitudes clash in unfortunate ways to create struggle and strife in what could be a beautiful relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countless women call Dr. Laura, unhappy in their marriages and seemingly at a loss to understand the incredible power they have over their men to create the kind of home life they yearn for. Now, in &lt;em&gt;The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands,&lt;/em&gt; Dr. Laura shows you&amp;#8212;with real-life examples and real-life solutions&amp;#8212;how to wield that power to attain all the sexual pleasure, intimacy, love, joy, and peace you want in your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Laura&#39;s simple principles have changed the lives of millions. Now they can change yours.&lt;/p&gt;" />
