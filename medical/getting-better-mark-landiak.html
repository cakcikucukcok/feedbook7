  <title>Getting Better - Mark Landiak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are backpacking with your daughter in a remote part of the Grand Canyon and a mysterious illness decides to show up just as you are trying to make the climb out. Your chest is pounding, youre having trouble breathing and your legs feel like lead, but theres no one around to help you. You make it out alive only to learn that the climb back to health is going to be even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One doesnt normally connect humor with healing, but Getting Better is both helpful and, at times, hilarious. The book is an entertaining collection of one patients stories, thoughts and philosophies about how to deal with the physical and emotional trials of being seriously injured or ill. The author shares what he has learned about how relationships, faith, mental/physical fitness, and a sense of humor combine to help one cope with the ups and downs of the healing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If youre a patient, youll learn, laugh and nod along as we examine some ideas for getting better in some facets of our lives. And, Getting Better isnt just for patients. Family members, friends, and caregivers will also find this book to be entertaining and full of ideas about how they can help the healing process for the people they care about.&lt;/p&gt;" />
