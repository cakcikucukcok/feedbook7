  <title>Vertigo and Dizziness - Béla Büki, Alexander A. Tarnutzer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Vertigo and dizziness rate among the most frequently occurring presenting complaints in neurology and in general medical practice. Since most patients do not have acute complaints at the time of examination, the clinician requires keen judgment in making a diagnosis, as patients often report confusing, real, or hypothetical causes of their problems. An improvement in the scientific understanding of vestibular physiology in recent years has led to the development ofnew diagnostic tests and more effective therapies. However, many of these advances have been slow to be adopted into routine clinical practice. Part of the Oxford Neurology Library (ONL) series, Vertigo and Dizziness helps clinicians improve their management of patients with these conditions. The text provides an overview of clinical vestibular physiology as well as of the latest developments in bedside examination, diagnosis/differential diagnosis, and state-of-the-art therapy. Vertigo and Dizziness serves as an essential clinical guide for neurologists, otorhinolaryngologists, and trainees in those disciplines, andfor general practitioners and medical students." />
