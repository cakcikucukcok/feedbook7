  <title>Addictions Nursing - American Nurses Association, International Nurses Society on Addictions</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Co-published with the International Nurses Society on Addictions and ANA
This new edition contains up-to-date information on this dynamic specialty that applies a holistic approach employing biological, psychological, social, and spiritual factors to provide treatment to patients who are affected by alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use and persistent and recurrent maladaptive behaviors and addictive disorders. Much of the addictions nurse’s job involves teaching patients about the dangers of substance abuse and possible treatment options. Since addiction is both a mental and physical disease, these nurses are trained in both general medicine and mental health.
This go-to guide contains the most up-to-date information on this practice specialty. It specifies the who, what, where, when, why, and how of addictions nursing practice. The 16 standards are those by which all RNs in addictions nursing are held accountable for in their practice. Each standard is measurable by a set of specific competencies that serve as evidence of minimal compliance with that standard.
Additions Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice is a must-have title for clinicians, educators, students, and other healthcare works directly involved in this area of practice." />
