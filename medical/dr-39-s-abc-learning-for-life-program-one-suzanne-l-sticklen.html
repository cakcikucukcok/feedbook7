  <title>DR&#39;S ABC Learning for Life - Program One - Suzanne L Sticklen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The DR&#39;S ABC Learning for Life- Program One is recommended for infant to 6 years of age. Our aim in this package is for the parent/care giver to teach a young child *How to Raise the Alarm* in an Emergency situation especially when there is no-one around just you and the child, Grandchild etc, especially if you DO have health issues. Note* fill in your own country&#39;s Emergency Services Number where provided in the book  ( _ _ _ )   This book contains Q &amp; A&#39;s, once the child can answer them correctly and with confidence, the parent/care giver or who ever is interacting with the child can fill in and cut out the AWARD certificate provided in the book. This can be displayed in the child&#39;s room, gradually building their confidence as children LOVE being awarded for their achievements.  Our singer is such a talented 6yr old, she sounds very cute and in beat to the actual rhythm of the CPR compressions. This CD teaches everyone the step-by-step knowledge needed, to learn How to Memorise CPR effectively, plus it&#39;s a catchy and recognisable jingle I&#39;m sure your young children will love. By the time they are 3 years old, most children know the words and love dancing along to it.  This book/cd would be a great benefit for every household for the price, considering it could save a loved one&#39;s life. You never know, one day your child&#39;s quick actions in an emergency could save your life or any of their loved one&#39;s lives.  Wouldn&#39;t it be wonderful, in the near future, if...  EVERYONE CAN SAVE A LIFE YOU AND ME! ******" />
