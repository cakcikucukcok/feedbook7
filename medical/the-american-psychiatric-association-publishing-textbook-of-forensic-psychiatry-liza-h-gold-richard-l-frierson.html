  <title>The American Psychiatric Association Publishing Textbook of Forensic Psychiatry - Liza H. Gold, Richard L. Frierson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The inaugural edition of The American Psychiatric Association Publishing Textbook of Forensic Psychiatry was the first of its kind, and subsequent editions have raised the bar, earning it a spot as a leading text in this fascinating subspecialty of psychiatry. This new, third edition is the product of a painstaking and exhaustive revision process that resulted in a significantly expanded and restructured work. This edition is a thorough review of the field yet is flexible enough to be useful to a diverse audience. Because the topics in and structure of this edition were informed by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology&#39;s Content Outline for the Certification Examination in Forensic Psychiatry, it can be used as a core text during forensic psychiatry fellowship training or as a review text to prepare for the certification or maintenance of certification exam. An excellent resource on legal issues in clinical practice, the book will also be an invaluable reference for general psychiatrists, who frequently encounter complicated forensic issues, such as informed consent, confidentiality, and the physician-patient relationship. The editors, two of the foremost experts in forensic psychiatry, faced the challenge of creating a text that accurately and fully reflects the latest advances in both the law and psychiatry, while enhancing learning. This comprehensive, yet accessible volume does just that.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Every chapter has been revised, and 10 new chapters address topics of critical importance -- presented in a structure that facilitates study:  ? The book highlights the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law&#39;s Landmark Cases in Forensic Psychiatry, listing the cases at the beginning of each chapter and highlighting them within the text. This helps readers master the key points in all topic areas, while fostering understanding of the impact of the evolution of legal principles in statutory and case law in forensic psychiatry. ? A new section on criminal justice includes chapters that address evaluations of competencies in the criminal justice system, assessment of criminal responsibility, and the role of psychiatry in death penalty cases.? An entire section is devoted to forensic psychiatric issues involving children and adolescents, including general principles of evaluation of juveniles, evaluations of juveniles in civil law, and evaluations of juveniles in the criminal justice system? New and revised chapters address the impact of technology on forensic psychiatry, including neuroimaging, the Internet, and telepsychiatry? The book thoroughly addresses forensic assessments of all kinds, and introduces two new and critical chapters on risk assessment of suicide and violence? Finally, an index of Landmark Cases and an extensive subject index provide the foundational knowledge and navigational tools to identify relevant cases and topics quickly and easily. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The American Psychiatric Association Publishing Textbook of Forensic Psychiatry takes the reader from fundamental concepts to cutting-edge research. Practicing general and forensic psychiatrists, psychiatry residents, and those enrolled in forensic fellowship programs will come to depend on both its accessibility and its rigor.&lt;/P&gt;" />
