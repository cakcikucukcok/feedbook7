  <title>Manual of Simulation in Healthcare - Richard H. Riley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Practising fundamental patient care skills and techniques is essential to the development of trainees&#39; wider competencies in all medical specialties. After the success of simulation learning techniques used in other industries, such as aviation, this approach has been adopted into medical education. This book assists novice and experienced teachers in each of these fields to develop a teaching framework that incorporates simulation.
The Manual of Simulation in Healthcare, Second Edition is fully revised and updated. New material includes a greater emphasis on patient safety, interprofessional education, and a more descriptive illustration of simulation in the areas of education, acute care medicine, and aviation. Divided into three sections, it ranges from the logistics of establishing a simulation and skills centre and the inherent problems with funding, equipment, staffing, and course development to the
considerations for healthcare-centred simulation within medical education and the steps required to develop courses that comply with &#39;best practice&#39; in medical education.
Providing an in-depth understanding of how medical educators can best incorporate simulation teaching methodologies into their curricula, this book is an invaluable resource to teachers across all medical specialties." />
