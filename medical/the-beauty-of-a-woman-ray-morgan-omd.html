  <title>The Beauty of a Woman - Ray Morgan Omd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What do women want? Freuds most famous question is answered by Dr. Ray Morgan in his new book, The Beauty of A Woman-Her Four Emotional, Physical &amp; Spiritual Phases. In this book, Dr. Morgan brings his candor, wit and solid wisdoms as he chronicles each phase of a womans journey from puberty through post-menopause. Hot flashes, night sweats, bone loss, mid-life slumps, loneliness, marital and family stress, work anxieties and issues of power all take on new urgency as women contemplate the decades ahead. 
Dr. Morgan explores a woman&#39;s needs, concerns, problems, passions, hopes and frustrations while drawing from the many confessions he has gained from thousands of women over the years. He guides the contemporary woman through the turbulent challenges and surprising pleasures that comes with each change in a concrete and compassionate way. Dr. Morgan reveals in this major new book that it is between puberty and post-menopause that life precisely happens and it is during this time that women are most likely to reinvent themselves and become masters of their fate. 
The Phases:
Teens: A Time of Confusion and New Discoveries.
Twenties: A Time of Lifes Great Expectations and Ideals-The Superwoman
Thirties: Mid-Life Malaise-The Emotional Water Shed
Forties: The Climacteric Season of Change 
Fifties: The Best of Life- Daring to Leave the Past Behind" />
