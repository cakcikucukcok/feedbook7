  <title>The EHRA Book of Pacemaker, ICD, and CRT Troubleshooting: Case-based learning with multiple choice questions - Haran Burri, Carsten Israel, Jean-Claude Deharo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An essential companion for both the aspiring and practising electrophysiologist, The EHRA Book of Pacemaker, ICD and CRT Troubleshooting assists device specialists in tackling both common and unusual situations that that they may encounter during daily practice. Taking a case-based approach, it examines pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronisation therapy.Much more than just a technical manual of device algorithms, the cases help readers to consolidate their technical knowledge, and improve their reasoning and observation skills so they are able to tackle device troubleshooting with confidence. The 70 cases are arranged in three sections by increasing levels of difficulty to walk readers through all the skills and knowledge they need in an easy to use and structured format. Each case contains a short clinical description and a device tracingfollowed by a multiple choice question. Answers are supplied with detailed annotations of the tracing and an in-depth discussion of the case, highlighting practical hints and tips as well as providing an overview of the technical function of devices. A useful summary of principal device features andfunctions is also included. The EHRA Book of Pacemaker, ICD and CRT Troubleshooting is the perfect companion for electrophysiologists, cardiology trainees and technical consultants working with device patients as well as for those studying for the EHRA accreditation exam in cardiac pacing.This print edition of The EHRA Book of Pacemaker, ICD, and CRT Troubleshooting comes with a years access to the online version on Oxford Medicine Online.
