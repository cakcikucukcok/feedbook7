  <title>How to Become a Schizophrenic - John Modrow, Bertram P. Karon Ph.D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="demonstrates the physical, psychological, and social harm resulting from the label schizophrenic and the continuous need to reexamine the underpinnings and attitudes of psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Of all the books written about schizophrenianone is more comprehensive, accurate, thorough, and clearer in style and statement than John Modrows classic &lt;i&gt;How to Become a Schizophrenic&lt;/i&gt;.  Modrow, who is a recovered schizophrenic and is, perhaps, the unrecognized and unappreciated worlds foremost authority on this disorder, has performed a truly invaluable service and has made the major contribution to our understanding of the causes and cures of this pseudodisease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Robert A Baker, Ph.D., former chairman of the Department of Psychology, University of Kentucky; author of &lt;i&gt;They Call It Hypnosis, Hidden Memories:  Voices and Visions from Within and Mind Games: Are We Obsessed with Therapy?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best things Ive read on the subjectI am struck by the richness of the ideas and the research and the soundness of the conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Peter Breggin, M.D., founder and director of the International Center for the Study of Psychiatry and Psychology; author of &lt;i&gt;Toxic Psychiatry and Talking Back to Prozac&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a very important contribution to the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Theodore Lidz, M.D., former chairman of the Department of Psychiatry, Yale University; author of &lt;i&gt;The Origin and Treatment of Schizophrenic Disorders and Schizophrenia and the Family&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;well researched and easily readable (a difficult combination to achieve)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Judi Chamberlin, author of &lt;i&gt;On Our Own: Patient-Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;meticulously challenges all the major research that claims that schizophrenia is a biological disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Ty C. Colbert, Ph.D., author of &lt;i&gt;Broken Brains or Wounded Hearts: What Causes Mental Illness&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before reading the book, I was largely convinced that schizophrenia was primarily a brain disease. Modrow has forced me to take a second look, however, and reconsider the psychological causes of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Vancouver Sun&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is ennobling that despite bad and discouraging treatment he was able to understand himself and others, and share that acquired knowledge in an accurate and helpful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Bertram P. Karon, PhD., professor of clinical psychology, Michigan State University; author of &lt;i&gt;Psychotherapy of Schizophrenia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gives clear proof that theres real hope. Truly a remarkable book!&lt;/p&gt;
