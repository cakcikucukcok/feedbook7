  <title>Paramedic: M.O.S. - C.B. Garris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While a profound and much deserved amount of attention has always been directed toward the firefighters and police officers who were affected by the events of September 11, 2001, seldom has there been any attention provided to the often unrecognized rescuer who bears the title of Emergency Medical Technician or Paramedic who suffered equal consequences. These very special people have routinely been referred to simply as &quot;emergency workers&quot; or &quot;ambulance drivers,&quot; rather than by the title they continuously demonstrate by the nature of their very trying profession.  PARAMEDIC: M.O.S., pulled from the author&#39;s EMS experiences; was assembled to provide deeper insight into the mind of one such New York City Emergency Medical Technician/Paramedic and is dedicated to all emergency service workers and first responders.  Inspired by true events pre-September 11th, a Paramedic of NYC EMS finds his world suddenly turned upside down by a series of in-the-line-of-duty events. In an effort to understand what brought him there, he begins reconnecting the events in his work and personal life that created this unforeseen scenario. Facing daily crises and how they apply to how he entered this line of work, readers are also shown the closeness that is felt and experienced working in such close proximity to those who face death and destruction together as a team daily.  Comforted and kept together by his female mate, readers are taken through the sometimes playing field and often minefield of Emergency Medical Services in New York City and what it means to be a Member of the Service.  PARAMEDIC: M.O.S. is a profound and deeply personal look into the experiences on the front lines of Emergency Medical Services in New York City.  EMTs and paramedics not only experience the highs and lows of constant exposure to psychologically traumatic events but in addition to the constant intensity of patients revived or lost due to these events.  Furthermore, EMTs and Paramedics are also forced to deal with coworkers who are sometimes ineffective, self-serving, uncaring, as well as bureaucratic red tape, politics, and often personal tragedy within their own fraternal public safety family.  These incidents rarely, if ever, get reported in the general media. This book was created to share the human condition of EMT&#39;s and Paramedics, their camaraderie, bravery, and skill.  Although September 11, 2001 claimed at least eight precious lives of these specialized rescuers, not even this was enough to direct attention toward the New York City Emergency Medical Technicians and Paramedics who lose their lives daily or are permanently scarred in the line of duty. The title of &quot;hero&quot; for those that have died and those that are out there every day risking their lives to save others existed long before September 11th changed calendar days. This book is an offering to share that view." />
