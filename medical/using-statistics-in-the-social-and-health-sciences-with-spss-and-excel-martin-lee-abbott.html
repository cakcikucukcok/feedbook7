  <title>Using Statistics in the Social and Health Sciences with SPSS and Excel - Martin Lee Abbott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Provides a step-by-step approach to statistical procedures to analyze data and conduct research, with detailed sections in each chapter explaining SPSS® and Excel® applications&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book identifies connections between statistical applications and research design using cases, examples, and discussion of specific topics from the social and health sciences. Researched and class-tested to ensure an accessible presentation, the book combines clear, step-by-step explanations for both the novice and professional alike to understand the fundamental statistical practices for organizing, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from research data in their field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book begins with an introduction to descriptive and inferential statistics and then acquaints readers with important features of statistical applications (SPSS and Excel) that support statistical analysis and decision making. Subsequent chapters treat the procedures commonly employed when working with data across various fields of social science research. Individual chapters are devoted to specific statistical procedures, each ending with lab application exercises that pose research questions, examine the questions through their application in SPSS and Excel, and conclude with a brief research report that outlines key findings drawn from the results. Real-world examples and data from social and health sciences research are used throughout the book, allowing readers to reinforce their comprehension of the material.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Using Statistics in the Social and Health Sciences with SPSS® and Excel® &lt;/i&gt;includes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use of straightforward procedures and examples that help students focus on understanding of analysis and interpretation of findings&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Inclusion of a data lab section in each chapter that provides relevant, clear examples&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Introduction to advanced statistical procedures in chapter sections (e.g., regression diagnostics) and separate chapters (e.g., multiple linear regression) for greater relevance to real-world research needs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emphasizing applied statistical analyses, this book can serve as the primary text in undergraduate and graduate university courses within departments of sociology, psychology, urban studies, health sciences, and public health, as well as other related departments. It will also be useful to statistics practitioners through extended sections using SPSS® and Excel® for analyzing data.&lt;/p&gt;" />
