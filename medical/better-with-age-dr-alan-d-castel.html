  <title>Better with Age - Dr. Alan D. Castel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Age is an important number, but it can also be deceiving. After 40, most people say they feel younger than their years, some lie about their age, and many attempt to hide the signs of growing old.
&lt;em&gt;Better with Age&lt;/em&gt; addresses the many myths and paradoxes about the aging process. Although most people think of their later years in terms of decline, they can be one of the best times in life.  This book presents the latest scientific research about the psychology of aging, coupled with insights from those who have succeeded in doing it well, such as Maya Angelou, Bob Newhart, Jared Diamond, John Glenn, and John Wooden.
We are all aging, and many people are concerned about what to expect with advancing years.  Retirement, happiness, and brain health are some of the many topics covered in this book.  &lt;em&gt;Better with Age&lt;/em&gt; shows what we can do now, at any stage in life, to make sure we enjoy old age." />
