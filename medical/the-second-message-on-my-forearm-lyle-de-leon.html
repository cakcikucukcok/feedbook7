  <title>The Second Message on My Forearm - Lyle De Leon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;MAJOR SPIRITUAL EVENTS IN MY WHOLE LIFE&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;1. When I was 7 years old, during World War II, my mother had severe malaria. The few neighbors thought that early evening that this could be her last hour on earth. At that same moment she was in another world. She had a near-death experience (NDE). She met the Lord Jesus and asked him if he could see God. Jesus answered her that God was too bright for her to see. She was told to back to earth and take care of the children especially the eldest as God has a plan for him.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;2. When I was 20, a very loud voice awakened me at 4:00 in the morning.. He said: &quot;Thou shall prophesy!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;3. At 29, at 3:00 a.m, a Spirit possessed me for 30 minutes.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;4. At 46, I was awakened by a strange noise. I felt a small piece of paper (the size of a medium-size stamp). This was placed on my right palm. The message was &quot;I have called Thee.&quot; Below the message was Isaiah 43:1&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;5. At 48. Lord Jesus, appeared before me in the clouds.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;6. In 2014, a message was written on My Right Forearm.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;7. In 2015, a second message was written on My Right Forearm.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;MALACHI 4:5&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Behold. I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadfull day of the Lord.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;ISAIAH 46:11&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executes my counsel from a far country: yes, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.&lt;/P&gt;" />
