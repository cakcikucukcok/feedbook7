  <title>Manual of Neural Therapy According to Huneke - J. Peter Dosch, Mathias Dosch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="More and more patients with chronic pain and other disorders are relying on neural therapy - a treatment concept based on employing the properties of local anesthetics to regulate disorders of the autonomic system - to alleviate their symptoms. Yet there are precious few spezialized, didactic resources for medical practitioners interested in learning about this highly effective therapeutic alternative.The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Manual of Neural Therapy According to Huneke&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; offers accessible, practical information on all aspects of neural therapy as it is practiced today. Designed for use in the classroom and in the clinic, this illustrated manual comprises three sections:- Theory and Practice of neural therapy according to Huneke -- including detailed definitions of all terminology; discussions of experiments, successes, and failures of neural therapy; the scientific theory behind segmental therapy and interference fields; and practical applications.- Encyclopedia of neural therapy -- featuring an encyclopedia of conditions and indications in every anatomic region, as well as numerous case studies.  - Techniques of neural therapy --  a comprehensive, substantially illustrated list of  injection procedures, including detailed guidance on insertion points, direction, and depth.  Distilling decades of clinical research and hands-on experience, this unique book is essential reading for practitioners of all disciplines interested in exploring how contemporary neural therapy can complement and enhance the way they practice medicine." />
