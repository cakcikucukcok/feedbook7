  <title>Compendium for the Antenatal Care of High-Risk Pregnancies - Harini Narayan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="High-risk pregnancies are increasing and form a significant proportion of the pregnant patient population. Compendium for the Antenatal Care of High-Risk Pregnancies takes a unique approach to over 140 conditions, combining Fact Files, Care Pathways, and Information for Patients in one volume. The book is designed to provide a practical and accessible individualised framework of information for doctors in busy clinical environments, and to integratethe specialist care offered to women with high-risk pregnancies.For each condition, the book covers vital points on risk reduction, clinical governance, discussion with patients, and required documentation. This is important in a litigious environment with high patient expectations, and demonstrates how clinical governance and risk management are interwoven in daily clinical practice.The model care pathways are designed as clear, practical templates, ensuring the best care for the patient, while ensuring that visits, staff time, and resources are not wasted. The information for patients section is a valuable resource for busy staff, especially as it is increasingly important that patients are informed participants in their care.Following current RCOG and NICE guidance, the book is heavily referenced and evidence-based, resulting in a reliable resource for obstetricians of all grades. Due to its integrated approach, the book is beneficial to midwives, and any specialists from other disciplines involved in the care of patients with high-risk pregnancies." />
