  <title>Ultrasound Guidance in Regional Anaesthesia: Principles and practical implementation - Peter Marhofer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ultrasonographic guidance for regional anaesthetic blocks is an innovative technique that allows for the direct visualization of nerves, adjacent structures and the position of the needle, as well as for the precise observation of the spread of local anaesthetic. The advantages of the technique allow for the exact administration of moderate volumes of local anaesthetic, reducing the risk of complications. Written by a physician with 16 years experience in ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia, this second edition of the well-received practical handbook provides a concise summary of the basics of ultrasound technology and the most recent techniques in the use of ultrasound to guide peripheral nerve blocks, focusing specifically on ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block techniques.All chapters have been carefully revised to provide the most recent knowledge in the topic of ultrasound in regional anaesthesia. A strong focus has still been attached on anatomical descriptions and subsequent practical implementations. Paediatric applications are now included in this new edition to aid paediatric anaesthesiologists, as well as the incorporation of neuraxial techniques to complete the entire topic. With illustrated colour images throughout, this book is highly relevant toanaesthesiologists and pain specialists with an interest in regional anaesthesia." />
