  <title>The Remarkable Developments of Heart and Chest Surgery in the 20Th Century - Armand A. Lefemine Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author is a board-certified thoracic and heart surgeon who studied and learned the craft of thoracic surgery under one of the great pioneers in the development of heart surgery. The rapid multiplication of heart and lung operations as well as the diagnostic tools and the mechanical, electrical, and chemical means to support life during surgery is a story that needs to be told. It is not an uncomplicated story but one that is easy to appreciate particularly if you are one of those who benefited and thousands did. The table of contents gives some idea of the impressive extent of the blossoming of thoracic surgery particularly in the last fifty years of the twentieth century." />
