  <title>A Good Death - Sandra Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Having a good death is our final human right, argues Sandra Martin in this updated and expanded version of her bestselling and award-winning social history of the right to die movement in Canada and around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winner of the BC National Award for Canadian Non-Fiction, finalist for both the Donner Prize in Public Policy and the Dafoe Prize for History, A Good Death has a new chapter on Canada&amp;#8217;s Medical Assistance in Dying Law.&amp;#160; The law allows mentally competent adults, who are suffering grievously from incurable conditions, to ask for a doctor&amp;#8217;s help in ending their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does the law go far enough? No, says Martin. She delivers compelling stories about the patients the law ignores: people with life-crushing diseases who are condemned to suffer because their natural deaths are not reasonably foreseeable. With a clear analytical eye, she exposes the law&amp;#8217;s shortcomings and outlines constitutional challenges, including the presumed right of publicly-funded faith-based institutions to deny suffering patients a legal medical service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin argues that Canada can set an example for the world if it can strike a balance between compassion for the suffering and protection of the vulnerable, between individual choice and social responsibility. &lt;em&gt;A Good Death&lt;/em&gt; asks the tough question none of us can avoid: How do you want to die? The answer will change your life&amp;#8212;and your death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;[An] excellent new book. . . .The timeliness is hard to overstate.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;The Globe and Mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What truly distinguishes this book is the reportage on individuals and families who have fought to arrange for a better death. . . .
