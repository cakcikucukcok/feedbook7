  <title>Facial Danger Zones - Brooke Seckel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Subperiosteal, extended sub-SMAS, deep plane, and composite rhytidectomy are all names that have been used to describe the current, more extensive operations for facial rejuvenation. Although these procedures provide superior results, they also involve deeper dissections with the potential for injury to the facial nerves. In order to avoid injury to these nerves, a thorough understanding of their locations is crucial for surgeons performing these operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facial Danger Zones, 2nd Edition&lt;/strong&gt;, by Dr. Brooke Seckel, provides the key to safety in these procedures. Drawing on his expertise in neurology and plastic surgery, Dr. Seckel has created a practical and beautifully illustrated color atlas to alert surgeons to the facial danger zones encountered in these deep plane face lifts. Divided into seven major facial danger zones, this clinical atlas takes each zone and graphically demonstrates the nerve and consequence of injury, the anatomic borders of each facial danger zone, and the techniques for safe surgical dissection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are performing, or preparing for, the more extensive face-lift procedures, this book will help you avoid the surgical complications of facial nerve damage. It is a must for every plastic surgeon performing face lifts or any facial procedure.&lt;/p&gt;" />
