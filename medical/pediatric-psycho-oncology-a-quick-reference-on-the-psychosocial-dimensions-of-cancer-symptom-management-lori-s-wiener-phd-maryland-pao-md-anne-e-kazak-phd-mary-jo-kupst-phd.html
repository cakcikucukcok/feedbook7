  <title>Pediatric Psycho-Oncology: A Quick Reference on the Psychosocial Dimensions of Cancer Symptom Management - Lori S. Wiener PhD, Maryland Pao Md, Anne E. Kazak PhD, Mary Jo Kupst PhD...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pediatric Psycho-Oncology is a comprehensive handbook that provides best practice models for the management of psychological, cognitive, and social outcomes of adolescents living with cancer and their families. Chapters cover a wide range of topics including psychological aspects of particular pediatric cancers and their treatments, how to talk to a child and family at critical times during the disease course, genetic testing, individual, family, educational, psychological and psychiatric interventions, and caring for international patients . Each chapter highlights the necessity of embracing an interdisciplinary approach to ensure that each child has the best options for living with cancer and, when cure is not possible, that death occurs with as much dignity as possible for the child and family. An extensive resource section is appended to provide information on written, online, video, community, national and international services and programs. This book features contributions from experts designed to help clinicians review, anticipate and respond to emotional issues that often arise in the context of treating pediatric cancer patients. Numerous cross-references and succinct tables and figures make this concise reference easy to use. Pediatric Psycho-Oncology is an ideal resource for helping pediatric oncologists and nurses recognize when it may be best to refer patients to their mental health colleagues and for those who are establishing pediatric oncology services or adding psychosocial components to existing clinics." />
