  <title>Laughing Gas, Viagra, and Lipitor: The Human Stories behind the Drugs We Use - Jie Jack Li</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The stories behind drug discovery are fascinating, full of human and scientific interest.  This is a book on the history of drug discovery that highlights the intellectual splendor of discoverers as well as the human frailty associated them. History is replete with examples of breakthrough medicines that have saved millions of lives. Ether as an anesthetic by Morton; penicillin as an antibiotic by Fleming; and insulin as an anti-diabetic by Banting are just a few examples.  The discoverers of these medicines are doubtlessly benefactors to mankind--for instance, without penicillin, 75% of us probably would not be alive because some of our parents or grandparents would have succumbed to infections.  Dr. Jack Li, a medicinal chemist who is intimately involved with drug discovery, has assembled an astounding amount of facts and information behind important drugs through extensive literature research and interviews with many inventors of the drugs including Viagra and Lipitor.  There have been many myths and inaccuracies associated with those legendary drugs.  The inventors perspectives afforded this book an invaluable accuracy and insight because history is not history unless it is true.  The text is supplemented by many anecdotes, pictures and postage stamps.  Both specialist and layman will find Laughing Gas, Viagra, and Lipitor informative and entertaining. Students in chemistry, pharmacy, and medicine, workers in healthcare and high school science teachers will find this book most useful." />
