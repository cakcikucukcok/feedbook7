  <title>Hidden Lives - Andrew Boden, Lenore Rowntree, Gabor Mate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A revised and updated edition of a collection of personal essays that illuminate what life is like for those who live with mental illness, and how it impacts their family members.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 4 million Canadians and 57 million Americans suffer from a diagnosable mental illness, and yet there are still considerable stigmas and a great deal of misunderstanding surrounding even the most common diagnoses—schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, clinical depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and dissociative identity disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than analyze the diagnoses and symptoms, these first-hand accounts focus on the very essence of a psycho-emotional breakdown, and respond to the mental, physical, and emotional turmoil it inevitably causes. What does a mother do when her teenage son&#39;s personality suddenly fractures? How does a police officer cope when his employer refuses to provide adequate care until he can prove his PTSD is work-related? How do children grow up under the care of a manic father whose illness lands him in and out of medical and social incarceration?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw, honest, and painful, these essays communicate disappointment and despair, but also courage and compassion. They offer a lifeline for sufferers and support for their friends and family, and promote new and improved attitudes toward those with mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a foreword by respected physician, bestselling author, and renowned speaker Dr. Gabor Maté, &lt;i&gt;Hidden Lives&lt;/i&gt; gives readers a place to turn, and provides a platform to share their struggle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
