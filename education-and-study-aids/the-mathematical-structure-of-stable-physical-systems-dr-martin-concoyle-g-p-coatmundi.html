  <title>The Mathematical Structure of Stable Physical Systems - Dr. Martin Concoyle, G.P. Coatmundi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is an introduction to the simple math patterns used to describe fundamental, stable spectral-orbital physical systems (represented as discrete hyperbolic shapes), the containment set has many-dimensions, and these dimensions possess macroscopic geometric properties (which are also discrete hyperbolic shapes). Thus, it is a description which transcends the idea of materialism (ie it is higher-dimensional), and it can also be used to model a life-form as a unified, high-dimension, geometric construct, which generates its own energy, and which has a natural structure for memory, where this construct is made in relation to the main property of the description being, in fact, the spectral properties of both material systems and of the metric-spaces which contain the material systems, where material is simply a lower dimension metric-space, and where both material-components and metric-spaces are in resonance with the containing space. Partial differential equations are defined on the many metric-spaces of this description, but their main function is to act on either the, usually, unimportant free-material components (to most often cause non-linear dynamics) or to perturb the orbits of the, quite often condensed, material trapped by (or within) the stable orbits of a very stable hyperbolic metric-space shape." />
