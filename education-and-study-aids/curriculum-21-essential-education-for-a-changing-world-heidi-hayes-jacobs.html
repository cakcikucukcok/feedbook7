  <title>Curriculum 21: Essential Education for a Changing World - Heidi Hayes Jacobs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;What year are you preparing your students for? 1973? 1995? Can you honestly say that your school&#39;s curriculum and the program you use are preparing your students for 2015 or 2020? Are you even preparing them for today?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With those provocative questions, author and educator Heidi Hayes Jacobs launches a powerful case for overhauling, updating, and injecting life into the K-12 curriculum. Sharing her expertise as a world-renowned curriculum designer and calling upon the collective wisdom of 10 education thought leaders, Jacobs provides insight and inspiration in the following key areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Content and assessment--How to identify what to keep, what to cut, and what to create, and where portfolios and other new kinds of assessment fit into the picture.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Program structures--How to improve our use of time and space and groupings of students and staff.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Technology--How it&#39;s transforming teaching, and how to take advantage of students&#39; natural facility with technology.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Media literacy--The essential issues to address, and the best resources for helping students become informed users of multiple forms of media.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Globalization--What steps to take to help students gain a global perspective.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Sustainability--How to instill enduring values and beliefs that will lead to healthier local, national, and global communities.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Habits of mind--The thinking habits that students, teachers, and administrators need to develop and practice to succeed in school, work, and life.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answers to these questions and many more make &lt;i&gt;Curriculum 21&lt;/i&gt; the ideal guide for transforming our schools into what they must become: learning organizations that match the times in which we live.&lt;/p&gt;" />
