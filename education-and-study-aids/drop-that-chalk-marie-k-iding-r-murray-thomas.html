      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Drop that Chalk! A Guide to Better Teaching at Colleges and Universities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is designed for those planning to teach &amp;ndash; or already teaching and hoping to improve instruction &amp;ndash; in colleges, universities, or other institutions of higher education.

Guidelines for creating effective on-line courses are presented. This book also explains thirteen aspects of student diversity to help teachers understand their students, more effectively plan instruction for them, and shares a range of other suggestions to help maintain positive and effective learning environments that ensure students&amp;rsquo; success. The techniques and myriad examples shared in this book are based on the authors&amp;rsquo; over sixty years of combined teaching experiences, and on current research in educational psychology and related disciplines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
