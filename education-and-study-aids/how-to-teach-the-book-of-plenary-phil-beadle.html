  <title>How to Teach: The Book of Plenary - Phil Beadle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You paint an outside wall. It rains. What happens to the paint? It runs off, of course! So it is with our students. We teach them something. We can&#39;t be bothered to do the recap, the plenary, as we don&#39;t have any ideas. They leave the lesson. They promptly forget what you have taught them. There was no point their being in the lesson in the first place. The world continues turning. This practical little book of plenaries does what it says. It delivers a series of simple ideas for how to make your lesson endings - or mid-lesson recaps - interesting, engaging and cognitively challenging. Apply the ideas in this book and your students will leave the lesson with the information you have taught them still in their heads." />
