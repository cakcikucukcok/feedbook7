  <title>Empower Thyself! - Jeffrey Sams, Med</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You just received your college acceptance letter and you are thrilled as you celebrate with family and friends. Youre ready to undergo a whirlwind of orientations, explore the beautiful campus and ride that matriculation wave toward your degree. When you started you were pumped! Bring it on you said. You bought the paraphernalia, pens, book bags with the school logo. But, you never saw this coming - after a few semesters the novelty of this new venture began to wear off. What do you do when the courses become more-challenging? What do you do when you finally realize that instructors come from a pool of the good, the bad, and the ugly? What happens when your social life takes a dive, or even pregnancy occurs? What do you do when you just dont feel like it anymore? Or a loved-one becomes terminally ill? When it has gotten hard and you are no longer motivated and just want to get a job and move on with life; what do you do? At this point its easy to make poor decisions out of frustration. But if you combine the academic and biblical principles that I speak about in this book, you can become a better student and person overall.
As a longtime advisor to college students, I offer advice on how to succeed during your most challenging times in college and life itself. This book presents information on the mental toughness, the physical stamina, the spiritual strength and the healthy relationships that will make your college journey successful. 
You can learn why it is alright to take risks; to let some people go, and to fight injustice and discrimination on campus. You will discover what qualifies a mentor and why you need one.
As you go through college, never live by the opinions of others. Your future is in your own hands, and the life-changing biblical and academic principles that they dont teach you in freshman seminarbut that you can learn hereare all you need to Empower Thyself!" />
