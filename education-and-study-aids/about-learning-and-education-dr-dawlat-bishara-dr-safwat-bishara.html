  <title>About Learning and Education - Dr. Dawlat Bishara, Dr. Safwat Bishara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Developed societies have world-class healthcare and good education. Both command a good portion of the budget and public interest. America has healthcare services that are the envy of the world. But education has been suffering over the past few decades as evidenced by our childrens low scores on the international PISA Test when compared with other industrialized nations in math, science, and reading. Many blamed lack of funding, poverty, and minority students. Education powerhouses, Finland and Korea, regularly recruited their teachers from the top of their graduating class. Students were serious and studied hard; their parents were cognizant of the significance of education and set high expectations for their children. The society respected the teaching profession. Children were aware of their teachers achievements; they were respectful and spared no effort to learn." />
