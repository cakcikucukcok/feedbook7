  <title>The A, B, Cs to Z of Godly Parenting - Beverly J. Bond-Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This inspirational little parenting book was written across many days and nights as were the two previous books by Dr. Cox.  Unlike the other two books, however, this book began during the parenting years of her and her husbands four children and represents the congealment of wisdom across the years based on Dr. Coxs day-to-day experiences as a mother of four, clinical psychologist; seminary trained ordained minister, trained spiritual director and chaplain.  This book is the how-to book that places God at the Center of parenting.  At the heart of her writing is Dr. Coxs view of parenting as a sacred duty that must be taken seriously and done intentionally.  She hopes that the readers, regardless of faith tradition find Godly wisdoms within these pages.  Most of all, she hopes that she conveys that parenting is hard work with no short-cuts.  Parenting is not one thing.  For example, it is not just discipline, though discipline is important. And it is not just love, though love is essential.  Parenting is multifaceted.  Parenting requires commitment and energy.  Her greatest hope is that parents will work on getting-it-right before its too late.  Dr. Cox considers this her most important work, to date." />
