  <title>Integrated Algebra on the Ti-73 - Kathleen Noftsier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Integrated Algebra on the TI-73&lt;/i&gt; presents a graphing calculator workbook with exercises designed to be completed with the TI-73 graphing calculator. Many can also be completed with the TI-83+/TI-84+ graphing calculator.
Intended to serve as a guide for students preparing for the New York State Integrated Algebra Regents Exam, this textbook also
	gives alternate strategies for solving math problems that you already learned how to solve or calculate in integrated algebra class;
	provides extra practice on regents-type questions;
	demonstrates how to work around quirks in the programming of the calculator;
	teaches developing skills needed for the Geometry and Algebra 2/Trigonometry exams, as well as college calculus and statistics courses.
Some of topics covered go beyond the scope of the Integrated Algebra exam in order to accommodate use as a text as a mathematics elective. These can be omitted if the workbook is used as a supplement to a course leading to the Integrated Algebra regents. 
Prepare for the exam, learn your graphing calculator more thoroughly, and improve your knowledge of integrated algebra with &lt;i&gt;Integrated Algebra on the TI-73.&lt;/i&gt;" />
