  <title>Yes, We Are Stupid in America! - Dr. Vicky Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Students in countries such as Finland, South Korea, and Singapore continue to outperform their peers in America. But that hasnt stopped the United States government from spending more money on education as achievement plummets.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Dr. Vicky Wells, a former school principal, explores whats going on at the federal, state, and local levels so that members of the public can hold bureaucrats accountable. In a series of reality checks, she explains how to&lt;/P&gt;
	meet the growing crisis head on;&lt;/br&gt;
	equip students with the necessary skills upon graduation;&lt;/br&gt;
	make decisions based upon the input of real-life educators; and&lt;/br&gt;
	ignore politics in order to best serve students.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Teachers and parents trust leaders to make decisions based on whats best for the students. Even so, all too often, decision making seems to be more about politics and quid pro quoand this does not best serve students, educators, or the community.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The educational system continues to decline, and students keep dropping out or graduating without the knowledge they need to succeed. Its time to stop constantly changing curriculum and start focusing on the real problems confronting teachers and students.&lt;/P&gt;" />
