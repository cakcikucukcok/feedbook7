  <title>How to Think Critically Using Sun Tzu’S Art of War Stratagems - Daniel Theyagu, Sandra Daniel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This short and informative book is targeted at middle and higher level leaders as well as tertiary level students.  In recent years critical thinking has become an essential tool for leaders dealing with a highly volatile and ever changing market forces.  To become an excellent critical thinker requires the application of the right strategies that will allow you to address any given situation effectively and develop the ability to assess the best case scenario.  Once youve managed to do this the process of critical thinking will then allow you to analyse options and alternatives in case the best case scenario does not work in your favour.  
Sun Tzus Art of War stratagems provide an excellent metaphor and parable to direct your thinking into a critical mode.  By appreciating the underlying and hidden meaning of the stratagems it becomes possible to hone your critical thinking skill and become a better problem solver, solution finder and more importantly an effective decision maker. Ultimately, it is not how much body of knowledge you have that counts.  It is whether you are able to use that body of knowledge to a positive effect.  Knowledge without application is useless.  This book cuts through the jargons that are associated with critical thinking and gives you in a crisp and concise language what you need to do to become a critical thinker." />
