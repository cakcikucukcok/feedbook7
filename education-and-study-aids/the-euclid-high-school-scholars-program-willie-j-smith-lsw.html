  <title>The Euclid High School Scholars Program - Willie J. Smith Lsw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Euclid High School Scholars Program, in Euclid, Ohio, began in September 2006 with twenty-four students.  The students were selected from the African American male population in eleventh and twelfth grades with a grade point average of 3.0 or higher. At the first meeting, the young men had an opportunity to meet and greet each other. To their amazement, they realized that they were part of a new minority of academic achievers that existed in the entire school. 
The first goal for the group was improving the graduation rate among African American students in the school; the successful completion of this goal would accomplish another goalthat of closing the achievement gap between African American students and white students in the school. The group also aimed to establish a culture of academic excellence among the African American students in the school. 
In addition to sharing the compelling story of a successful educational program for young African American men, &lt;i&gt;The Euclid High School Scholars Program&lt;/i&gt; offers educators, parents, and students, a creative way to implement Positive Behavior Supports with their male students." />
