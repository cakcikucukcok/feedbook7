  <title>Diaspora of Thoughts - Cash Onadele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always&quot;&gt;
&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in&quot;&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;This book was born out of a passion for literature and the need to establish a cultural legacy for our next generation dispersed all over the World. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in&quot;&gt;&lt;I&gt;A Diaspora of Thoughts&lt;/I&gt;  fittingly &lt;I&gt;the dispersal of thoughts&lt;/I&gt;. Like many, I have always wondered how to communicate the African wise sayings, poems and prose we learned from our grandparents to our children- the next generation. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in&quot;&gt;Many children of our time fill their times with new computer games since we have failed to challenge them to recite and learn our culture through sayings, poems and prose, this has been the greatest reason to do this work.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in&quot;&gt;What you are about to read is a combination of wise sayings and poems mostly from early life in an African village, of course subsequent life experiences as well as comments from observing the life of others who have lived significant lives.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in&quot;&gt;Some poems cover views on matters that concern the oppressed peoples of the world and especially the colored race .&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in&quot;&gt;It expresses a sense of community enough for us to care about ourneighbor. Some of theserecitals deal with the excessiveness of the rich and the abjectness or lack in the poor and the responsibilities of both parties.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in&quot;&gt;Thiscollection of poems &amp; proseis for the individual or teacher interested in leisure reading and general literature as a whole. It is more about African and American sociologicalheritage wrapped in poetry &amp; prose.&lt;/P&gt;
