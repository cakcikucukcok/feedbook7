  <title>Building Winning Partnerships - Hari Baskaran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book draws upon the Out Source Service Agents Programme that was launched in Xerox India in 1998. It covers the transformation of a group of Service Technicians with no background of business into successful entrepreneurs. It captures their fears and challenges as they set off on an unfamiliar journey and how they gradually learned the ropes to become successful business men .There were failures and setbacks for some and successes for others. The book is a factual assessment of the programme, covering more than a decade since its launch.
The book covers what makes for good programme management and successful outsourcing of service operations through in- depth studies of thirteen of the early adopters of this programme. Each story provides rich material for use as case studies in training programmes and is also very good instructional material for those involved with customer services and outsource programme management.
The book covers some of the issues that led to less than acceptable results from the companys perspective and how these could have been avoided." />
