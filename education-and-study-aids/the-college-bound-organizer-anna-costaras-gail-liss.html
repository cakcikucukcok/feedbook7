  <title>The College Bound Organizer - Anna Costaras, Gail Liss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nearly three million students are expected to enroll as first-time freshmen in degree-granting institutions in the United States this school year. Each of these students will apply to many schools — five, 10, perhaps as many as 20 — and each of those applications has a daunting number of T’s to cross and I’s to dot. With standardized test taking and school visits, essays to write and forms to fill out, there is so much to do. It goes without saying that a student also attends school, keeps up homework, maintains that spot on the team or the lead role in the school play, volunteers at the local soup kitchen and possibly even holds down a part-time job. Applying to college is intimidating and overwhelming for both teenagers and their parents. 
The challenge is to be well informed, prepared, focused and organized throughout the multistep college search and admission process. 
The solution is The College Bound Organizer, the ultimate guide to help students effectively navigate this very complicated and stressful process. 
The book helps students:
•	Build a personal profile
•	Plan a individualized testing schedule
•	Research colleges to identify schools that are a good fit 
•	Develop a balanced list of schools
•	Complete and submit applications 
•	Apply for financial aid and scholarships 
•	Meet all deadlines
•	Sort through and manage application results 
•	Make a final decision 
Author tips and advice, and interviews with admission professionals offer insight into the process, including what admission officers are looking for in an applicant, common mistakes students make on their applications and when applying for financial aid, and other valuable information." />
