  <title>Committing to the Culture - Steve Gruenert, Todd Whitaker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In their follow-up to &lt;em&gt;School Culture Recharged&lt;/em&gt; and the best-selling &lt;em&gt;School Culture Rewired,&lt;/em&gt; Steve Gruenert and Todd Whitaker go deep into the roots of culture change and explore how school leaders can positively shift their cultures in a sustainable way.
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from the authors&#39; extensive experience and research, &lt;em&gt;Committing to the Culture&lt;/em&gt;
 &lt;br&gt; - Unpacks questions around the nature of culture, including the importance of vision and climate and how the tension between the past and the future can keep a culture stagnant. 
&lt;br&gt; - Explains how toxic cultures come about, why they can be so resistant to lasting change, and how not to change those cultures. 
&lt;br&gt; - Describes how to build a positive culture based on trust, collaboration, and commitment rather than fear, competition, and compliance. 
&lt;br&gt; - Offers advice to help leaders ensure that positive change endures, withstanding fads, toxic mindsets, and other threats.
&lt;p&gt;The authors provide real-world scenarios to illustrate how their ideas and approaches work in practice. Leaders will gain profound insight into how to create meaningful change, with the goal not just to &quot;transform&quot; their school but also to get all members of the school community to commit to culture change&amp;mdash;and make sure that change sticks.
