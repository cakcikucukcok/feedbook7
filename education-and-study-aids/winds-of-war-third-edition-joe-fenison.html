  <title>Winds of War Third Edition - Joe Fenison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Very clearly, the Church will be here until the seventh (last) trumpet, which sounds in Rev. 11:15, not 4:1. A lot happens before this trumpet sounds; it is a long trumpet process, commencing in Rev. 10, reported in 11:15 and the great harvest happens in Rev. 14:14-16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the interim, Rev. 12 is a drama from Jesus&amp;#39; day, ending today in great satanic fury and God&amp;#39;s protection of His people. The major part of today&amp;#39;s woes are in Rev. 11 and 13, with the mark of the beast being the most destructive. The Church will go through great persecution but will be harvested out in Rev. 14:16.Immediately thereafter Jesus treads the Grapes of God&amp;#39;s Wrath in 14:17-20, in preparation for the 7 vials of wrath, His wrath to follow in Rev. 15-19:5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The Church is not appointed to wrath and will not be on earth from 14:16. Note: The trumpets are over one-third of the earth; the vials of God&amp;#39;s wrath will be over 100% of those remaining. This &amp;ldquo;wrath&amp;rdquo; is recorded in over 18 verses in the New Testament.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I believe we are now in the entry of this final drama preceding the Rapture. MANY prophetic Scriptures have been or are being fulfilled right now. Much of the &amp;ldquo;language of God&amp;rdquo; has always been in the forces of nature... which is screaming out to us today to embrace Christ as our Savior and Master. Don&amp;#39;t focus on the world&amp;#39;s problems, but keep looking up and trusting obediently all the way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
