  <title>Learning Without Classrooms - Frank Kelly, Ted McCain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;With foreword by Jason Ohler&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite technological advancements, most secondary schools still function on ideas that are more than 100 years old. &lt;i&gt;Learning Without Classrooms&lt;/i&gt; outlines new guidelines for how schools must operate to remain relevant and effective as we move further into the 21st century. Making a persuasive argument for moving beyond the long-established idea of operating schools with traditional classroom instruction to a personalized learning environment for individual students, the authors detail six crucial elements of school management (community, instruction, time, technology, school facilities, and funding) and how to address them concurrently to improve secondary school learning environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transform secondary schools systemwide, from restructuring the physical learning environment to supporting personalized learning:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn the six elements of schooling, and understand how changing any one element influences the others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore nine critical skills students need for success in the modern world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the structure and methodology behind an advisory-based concept for school management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider scenarios of what learning will look like in the near future as powerful new technological tools become available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study seven visionary designs for how to renovate existing secondary school facilities to support technologically infused, personalized learning environments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
