  <title>The Songs of the Reed by Rumi: A Hermeneutical Perspective - Seyed Mohammad Hosseini Fard, Amin Karimnia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The present book encompasses all 23 English-translated versions of &quot;The Songs of The Reed&quot;, the first 18 couplets of Masnavi Manavi, Book I by Rumi, the greatest Iranian Mystical poet, called Nei Name, from 1772 to 2015 and offers a hermetical model of refreshed innovation to shed some light of those aspects of any given literary text unknown or feebly-explored hitherto. It should not go unsaid that the proposed model provides copious examples to a better and more profound appreciation of these newly examined dimensions. Even though only one form of literary text, poetry, was dealt with through this model, it would be a gross underestimate to relegate its functionality to this only genre. However, as there are and will be infinite answers to any given question, the author firmly stipulates that the proposed model is far from perfect and hopes it would spur the interested readers into making attempt to reconstruct the model and improve its effectiveness." />
