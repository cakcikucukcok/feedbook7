THE FRESHMAN SURVIVAL GUIDE&#39;s updated edition features new research and advice on issues such as mental health, sexual assault, and finding balance. It also features expanded sections on dating, money management, and an increased focus on how the over 1.5 million incoming freshman can prepare themselves for the biggest change they&#39;ve encountered in their lives: heading off to college." />
