  <title>Practical Research and Statistics - K.J. Kovach, P.A. Richardson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The main aim of this new book is to provide a single, efficient, and effective source for college and university students to understand research development and learn, then apply, statistical concepts while developing a Research Proposal or Research Study using the American Psychological Association (APA) format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a specialist text particularly well suited for introductory, accelerated, and short courses that emphasize quantitative approaches within research activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After teaching over 30 years, the authors know that several different texts commonly must be bought or used in learning to develop a research proposal or research study. Additionally, many colleges and universities have combined various research and statistical courses into one course or program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students, therefore, have to learn &lt;em&gt;what research is&lt;/em&gt; and its many concepts, learn various &lt;em&gt;descriptive and inferential statistics&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;apply APA format for completed reports&lt;/em&gt; during one school term. Instructors as well as students easily appreciate that a detailed grasp of the above three components during a single university course would be a daunting task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, the authors offer this practical integration and application of all three components into a single, recommended text, as an efficient, effective bridge to learning these complex areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind Maps are used to help readers organize the many detailed concepts and techniques herein. These Mind Maps are presented with the central concept at or near the middle of the diagram and subordinate concepts and techniques arranged as branches clockwise from the upper right around to the upper left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Instructors adopting this text, an Instructor Guide, chapter PowerPoint&amp;reg; files, and Test bank will be provided to facilitate the one course concept &amp;mdash; email a request to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:KJKovach@btinternet.com&quot;&gt;KJKovach@btinternet.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also the authors&amp;rsquo; web site, &lt;a href=&quot;https://practicalresearchandstatistics.com/&quot;&gt;https://PracticalResearchandStatistics.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors&amp;rsquo; Note: Certain technical examples and tables may not display as desired in the ebook version of our text, particularly on smaller screens.
