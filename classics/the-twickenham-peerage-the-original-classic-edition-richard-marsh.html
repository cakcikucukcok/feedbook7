&lt;p&gt;
Look inside the book: &lt;p&gt;There was Miss Desmond, as she said her name was, helping me make a rice pudding--as if she herself had ever seen one made in all her life before!--and carrying on with my two youngsters in the kitchen, just as much at her ease, for all I could see, as if children and kitchens were what she always had been used to; and now, if I could believe my eyes, was an Earl&#39;s son, come, as it seemed, to keep her company. 
...&#39;Well, Marchioness--I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the proper way in which to address a lady in your position, but if it isn&#39;t you&#39;ll have to excuse me till I do know--you are now one of the greatest ladies in the land, and I shall have to behave to you as such. 
...She smiled, in that quiet way she had, and when the one who spoke and looked as if she was a perfect lady--and I&#39;m sure she was much more of a lady than ever I shall be--came back again, Miss Desmond got rid of her with some excuse or other, and glad enough I was.
&lt;p&gt;About Richard Marsh, the Author:&lt;P&gt; A story about a mysterious oriental figure who pursues a British politician to London, where he wreaks havoc with his powers of hypnosis and shape-shifting, Marsh&#39;s novel is of a piece with other sensational turn of the 19th to 20th century fictions such as Stoker&#39;s Dracula, George du Maurier&#39;s Trilby, and Sax Rohmer&#39;s Fu Manchu novels.   Like Dracula and many of the sensation novels pioneered by Wilkie Collins and others in the 1860s, The Beetle is narrated from the perspectives of multiple characters, a technique used in many late 19th-century novels (those of Wilkie Collins and Stoker, for example) to create suspense and to confuse gender boundaries." />
