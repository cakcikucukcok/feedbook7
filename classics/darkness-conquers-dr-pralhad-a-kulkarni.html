      <meta name="description" content="Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely! Was this reason learn which Lala, a veteran freedom fighter toiled for his motherland, Markatstan? Complete freedom was Lalas dream. He and his followers toiled to gain freedom from Bears. But it was not the end but the beginning of a new epoch. This pure and fertile land, which gave shelter to monkeys, camels, tigers, horses, deer, zebra, giraffe became infected by an irresistible disease  CORRUPTION.  
Certainly Lala, Raman, Gbur, Roger and others had not sacrificed and fought with Bears for this day! How Lalas dream of an ideal nation shattered, is shown in this political fable.
	What is the meaning of freedom? It is behaving as you like? Does freedom give the administration right to exploit its own citizens? 
Lala and his followers struggled for freedom, total freedom. But what was the end? We see an end of a dynasty, an end of a culture in this fable." />
