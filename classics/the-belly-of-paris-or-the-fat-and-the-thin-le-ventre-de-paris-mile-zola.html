  <title>The Belly of Paris; Or, The Fat and The Thin (Le Ventre de Paris) - Émile Zola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The third novel in Zola&#39;s twenty-volume series entitled &quot;Les Rougon-Macquart,&quot; this story revolves around and within the 21-acre market Les Halles Centrales of Paris. The starving scholar Florent has escaped his unwarranted exile on Devil&#39;s Island, and he is alternately entranced and disgusted by his refuge in &#39;the belly of Paris.&#39; Zola describes the market and Florent&#39;s experiences in the midst of it with his characteristically captivating comprehension, foreshadowing the total mastery of working-class speech in his later works. Florent makes a friend of Claude Lantier, a painter who explains the battle being waged in the vast Central Markets between the &#39;fat&#39; burghers and &#39;thin&#39; lower class, in which Florent is soon embroiled. He is a man caught between the fat and the thin, and this lack of allegiance leads to painful condemnation and Florent&#39;s ultimate disintegration. Presented here is the somewhat expurgated 1895 translation of Ernest Alfred Vizetelly, entitled &quot;The Fat and the Thin&quot;." />
