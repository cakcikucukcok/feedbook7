The person concerned in the event had been told the real story of Abigail Clergy, and why Joshua Maples was called &amp;ldquo;Ali Baba,&amp;rdquo; and why Miss Clergy drove at four, always alone and with the curtains drawn, and why the children were afraid of her and called her witch, trying &amp;nbsp;to make their mothers admit that the Clergy house was haunted. That person was Thurley Precore&amp;mdash;born in Arcadia, the Corners admitted, although they did not call it by that name. They said, &amp;ldquo;Wherever Thurley Precore managed to get that smile and face and voice of hers and to sing more and more like an angel when every one knew&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo; and so forth and so on, the deduction arrived at being that God had let Himself realize His dream of beauty when He created Thurley Precore&amp;mdash;Thurley with the most worthless, indifferent parents about whom the Corners had ever heard tell." />
