  <title>A Piece Untitled - Latonya Binky Toran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lani is a young bi-racial girl. She was raised in the southern grit of sudsidized housing, in the heart of Nashville, Tennessee. She was raised by Cash, an African-American reformed alcoholic, after she was abandoned at birth by her Caucasian mother. Lani is devastated when she is faced with the sudden death of her only beloved parent. She is forced to make a choice to become a bride, rather than spend the rest of her teen years in a foster home. Lani discovers that poetry can be a refuge, when confronted with life&#39;s most challenging times. She struggles to find her voice in the mist of a controling husband, four children and a very overbearing mother-in-law. Lani learns about life, love and redemption in, &quot;A Piece Untitled.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
