          &lt;strong&gt;The last Cavanaugh to fall…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Assistant district attorney Janelle Cavanaugh understood how dangerous working on a high-profile criminal case could be. But when her assignment took a deadly turn, she was given a ruggedly handsome and infuriatingly quiet bodyguard.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Detective Sawyer Boone absolutely didn&#39;t want to babysit the maddening yet attractive daughter of the chief of detectives. Then Janelle&#39;s world came crashing around her, and Sawyer found himself &lt;em&gt;wanting&lt;/em&gt; to protect her. Risking his life was part of the job. Risking his heart became quite another matter.&lt;/p&gt;
