          &lt;strong&gt;“Nobody’s messing with my baby.” &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Nick wakes up in a hospital room with a case of amnesia – and a beautiful woman at his bedside, he can only remember being held captive for five gruelling years. Surely he wouldn’t forget someone as easy on the eyes as Laura. But Laura assures him that she and their son are very real.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Laura never forgot the man who stole her heart six years ago – even after he disappeared. She knows Nick will someday have to face his demons. But that day comes sooner than imagined when their son is kidnapped. Now he and Laura must rescue their child – and their last chance for a future together.&lt;/p&gt;
