Bistritz.&amp;ndash;Left Munich at 8:35 P.M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty. (Mem. get recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter, and he said it was called &amp;quot;paprika hendl,&amp;quot; and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I found my smattering of German very useful here, indeed, I don&amp;#39;t know how I should be able to get on without it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country." />
