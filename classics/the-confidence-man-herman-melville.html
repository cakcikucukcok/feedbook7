  <title>The Confidence-Man - Herman Melville</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A post-modern masterpiece; a century ahead of its time. The novel portrays a Canterbury Tales-style group of steamboat passengers whose interlocking stories are told as they travel down the Mississippi River toward New Orleans. The novel is written as cultural satire, allegory, and metaphysical treatise, dealing with themes of sincerity, identity, morality, religiosity, economic materialism, irony, and cynicism. And the novel itself tests the confidence of the reader as each character slides away beneath the muddy prose waters of the river. Melville introduces characters who change identities so rapidly that the reader is confronted with a portrait of the American frontier as perceived through a series of disguises." />

Though centered around the title character, The Confidence-Man portrays a group of steamboat passengers whose interlocking stories are told as they travel down the Mississippi River toward New Orleans.<br /><b><i>The Confidence-Man - Wikipedia</i></b> | Melville himself is something of an acquired taste and even among those who appreciate him, The Confidence-Man is something of an acid test. A dark carnival set aboard a Mississippi riverboat, Melville gives us no less than a disguise-shifting Satan to point up our human foibles, gullibilities, cruelties, and weaknesses, economic, social and religious.<br /><b><i>The Confidence-Man: Melville, Herman: 9781438284941 ...</i></b> | The Confidence-Man, satirical allegory by Herman Melville, published in 1857. This novel was the last to be published during Melville’s lifetime, and it reveals the author’s pessimistic view of an America grown tawdry through greed, self-delusion, and lack of charity.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Confidence-Man - Herman Melville</a> </h3></p><hr/>
