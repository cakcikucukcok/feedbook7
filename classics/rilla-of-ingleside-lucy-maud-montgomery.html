  <title>Rilla of Ingleside - Lucy Maud Montgomery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rilla of Ingleside is the eighth of nine books in the Anne of Green Gables series by Lucy Maud Montgomery, but was the sixth &amp;quot;Anne&amp;quot; novel in publication order.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book draws the focus back onto a single character, Anne and Gilbert&amp;#39;s youngest daughter Bertha Marilla &amp;quot;Rilla&amp;quot; Blythe. It has a more serious tone, as it takes place during World War I and the three Blythe boys&amp;mdash;Jem, Walter, and Shirley&amp;mdash;along with Rilla&amp;#39;s sweetheart Ken Ford, and playmates Jerry Meredith and Carl Meredith&amp;mdash;end up fighting in Europe with the Canadian Expeditionary Force. The book is dedicated: &amp;quot;To the memory of FREDERICA CAMPBELL MACFARLANE who went away from me when the dawn broke on January 25, 1919&amp;mdash;a true friend, a rare personality, a loyal and courageous soul.&amp;quot; Frederica, Maud&amp;#39;s cousin and best friend, grew up in Park Corner, PEI, but died in the worldwide flu epidemic of 1918/19.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Frederica may have been the model for Diana Barry, Anne of Green Gables&amp;#39; &amp;quot;bosom friend&amp;quot;: both had unusual, non-Christian first names, and the fictional Diana&amp;#39;s husband was named, perhaps not coincidentally, Fred. Rilla of Ingleside is the only Canadian novel written from a woman&amp;#39;s perspective about the First World War by a contemporary. The novel is also groundbreaking as it is one of the first non-Australian texts to mention the Gallipoli campaign and the sacrifice made by the ANZACs. At some point after Montgomery&amp;#39;s death in 1942, publishers quietly trimmed Rilla of Ingleside of a few thousand words, removing among other things passages containing historically accurate but now offensive anti-German sentiment. The trimmed version was the only available &amp;quot;in print&amp;quot; version for decades, until a new, restored and annotated edition of Rilla of Ingleside, edited by Benjamin Lefebvre (editor of Montgomery&amp;#39;s The Blythes Are Quoted) and Andrea McKenzie, was published by Viking Canada in October 2010." />
