  <title>Adieu - Honoré de Balzac</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The longish short story &amp;quot;Adieu&amp;quot; is an excerpt from Honore de Balzac&amp;#39;s sweeping masterpiece The Human Comedy. A ghost story of sorts, this tragic tale recounts the blossoming romance of two lovers whose relationship is torn asunder by the vagaries of war. When they reunite by chance years later, there is nothing left to be salvaged.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Honor&amp;eacute; de Balzac (20 May 1799 &amp;ndash; 18 August 1850) was a French novelist and playwright. The novel sequence La Com&amp;eacute;die humaine, which presents a panorama of post-Napoleonic French life, is generally viewed as his magnum opus.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Owing to his keen observation of detail and unfiltered representation of society, Balzac is regarded as one of the founders of realism in European literature. He is renowned for his multi-faceted characters; even his lesser characters are complex, morally ambiguous and fully human. Inanimate objects are imbued with character as well; the city of Paris, a backdrop for much of his writing, takes on many human qualities. His writing influenced many famous writers, including the novelists &amp;Eacute;mile Zola, Charles Dickens, Gustave Flaubert, Jack Kerouac, and Henry James, filmmakers Akira Kurosawa and Eric Rohmer as well as important philosophers such as Friedrich Engels. Many of Balzac&amp;#39;s works have been made into films, and they continue to inspire other writers." />
