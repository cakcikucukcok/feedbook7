  <title>The Red Badge of Courage (with an Introduction by William Targ) - Stephen Crane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First published serially in 1894 and lengthened for the book publication in 1895, “The Red Badge of Courage” is a classic modern depiction of the psychological turmoil of war from the perspective of an ordinary soldier. The story revolves around Henry Fleming, a member of the 304th regiment of the Union Army, serving during the American Civil War. At the start of the novel Henry is eager to show his patriotism in battle but when faced with the savagery of death he flees the frontline. Ashamed of his behavior, Henry spends the rest of the novel trying to redeem his earlier cowardice. Instantly popular from its original publication, “The Red Badge of Courage” garnered what H. G. Well’s would refer to as an “orgy of praise”, bringing Crane instant notoriety in the United States and abroad. Noted for its unique style, the work has been described as at once naturalistic, realistic, and impressionistic. Although never having seen battle Stephen Crane vividly depicted the grueling intensity of war in his landmark work. This edition includes an introduction by William Targ." />
