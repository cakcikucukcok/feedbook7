          &lt;strong&gt;The town of Whitehorse can still claim three eligible Corbett men, but not for long…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dalton Corbett’s secret past had finally caught up with him and taken residence above Whitehorse’s knitting shop – owned by the unsuspecting Georgia. Although Georgia had no reason to mistrust the woman she’d just rented to, Dalton knew how dangerous and deadly she was…just as he knew that Georgia was the type of girl his mother hoped he’d marry.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unwilling to see Georgia hurt, he devoted himself to ensuring her safety – and the more time he spent with her, the more he realised that she could be the woman for him!&lt;/p&gt;
