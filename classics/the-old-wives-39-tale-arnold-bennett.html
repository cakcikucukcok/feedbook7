  <title>The Old Wives&#39; Tale - Arnold Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Regarded as one of Arnold Bennett&amp;#39;s finest works, The Old Wives&amp;#39; Tale was first published in 1908.

Bennett&amp;#39;s inspiration was an encounter in a Parisian restaurant: &amp;quot;an old woman came into the restaurant to dine. She was fat, shapeless, ugly, and grotesque. She had a ridiculous voice, and ridiculous gestures. It was easy to see that she lived alone, and that in the long lapse of years she had developed the kind of peculiarity which induces guffaws among the thoughtless.&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I reflected, concerning the grotesque diner: &amp;quot;This woman was once young, slim, perhaps beautiful; certainly free from these ridiculous mannerisms.&lt;br /&gt;
