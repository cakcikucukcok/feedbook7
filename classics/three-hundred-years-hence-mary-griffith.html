  <title>Three Hundred Years Hence - Mary Griffith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three Hundred Years Hence is a utopian science fiction novel by author Mary Griffith.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is the first known utopian novel written by an American woman. The novel was originally published in 1836 as part of Griffith&amp;#39;s collection, Camperdown, or News from Our Neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The novel concerns a hero who falls into a deep sleep and awakens in the Utopian states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. Writers of utopian fiction generally need to set their imagined societies either in a remote place (as in Sir Thomas More&amp;#39;s original Utopia and many imitators), or in a different time. Griffith was the earliest American writer to project her protagonist into the future to encounter a vastly improved social order." />
