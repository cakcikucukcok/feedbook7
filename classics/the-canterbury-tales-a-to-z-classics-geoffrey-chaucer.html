One spring day, the Narrator of The Canterbury Tales rents a room at the Tabard Inn before he recommences his journey to Canterbury. That evening, a group of people arrive at the inn, all of whom are also going to Canterbury to receive the blessings of &amp;quot;the holy blissful martyr,&amp;quot; St. Thomas &amp;agrave; Becket. Calling themselves &amp;quot;pilgrims&amp;quot; because of their destination, they accept the Narrator into their company. The Narrator describes his newfound traveling companions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Host at the inn, Harry Bailey, suggests that, to make the trip to Canterbury pass more pleasantly, each member of the party tell two tales on the journey to Canterbury and two more tales on the journey back. The person who tells the best story will be rewarded with a sumptuous dinner paid for by the other members of the party. The Host decides to accompany the pilgrims to Canterbury and serve as the judge of the tales. (non illustrated)" />
