  <title>The Ayesha Collection - H. Rider Haggard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Ayesha Collection features She, Ayesha: The Return of She, She &amp;amp; Allan, and Wisdom&amp;#39;s Daughter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;She&amp;rdquo; is one of the classics of imaginative literature, and one of the best-selling books of all time. She was extraordinarily popular upon its release and has never been out of print. The story is a first-person narrative that follows the journey of Horace Holly and his ward Leo Vincey to a lost kingdom in the African interior. There they encounter a primitive race of natives and a mysterious white queen named Ayesha who reigns as the all-powerful &amp;quot;She&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;She-who-must-be-obeyed&amp;quot;. In this work, Rider Haggard developed the conventions of the Lost World subgenre, which many later authors emulated. &amp;ldquo;Ayesha, the Return of She&amp;rdquo; is a gothic-fantasy novel, a sequel to his far more popular and well known novel, She. &amp;ldquo;She and Allan&amp;rdquo; is a novel, in which Haggard brought together his two most popular characters, Ayesha from She (to which it serves as a prequel), and Allan Quatermain from King Solomon&amp;#39;s Mines. Wisdom&amp;#39;s Daughter is the final book in the Ayesha series.&amp;nbsp;" />
