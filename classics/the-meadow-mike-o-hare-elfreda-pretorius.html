  <title>The Meadow - Mike O’Hare, Elfreda Pretorius</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Get ready for a consciousness shift! The Meadow is the most intriguing, mysterious, beautiful love story Ive ever had the pleasure of reading. I am still amazed that the authors could have brought this masterpiece to life while living an ocean apart. The gamut of emotions they dare the reader to experience makes for a wild, but thrilling ride. The Meadow touched the very core of my being and gave me a whole new perspective on all those who have come and gone in my life, the ones that shared beauty with me as well as the ones who caused me pain.&lt;br&gt; 
Susan Nicholas, Reiki Master&lt;p&gt; 
The Meadow is a sensational and captivating account of two peoples lives as they meet again and again over many centuries. It weaves a path of wisdom through the ages, and awakens our curiosity, enriching our lives as we become involved with its wonderful characters.&lt;br&gt; 
Judy Suke, Motivational Humorist, President, Triangle Seminars, Professor, Sheridan College&lt;p&gt; 
There is a saying known by those on their path of enlightenment: Everything comes at the perfect time, in the perfect way. The Meadow is exactly the sort of work where if it somehow comes your way, it is a timely message and gift from the Universe to assist you in advancing your own spiritual evolution. The Meadow is a magical journey for the characters in the story and the reader alike. The lessons learned by the protagonists will shine a light on whatever issues a reader may be experiencing. The work is serendipity, synchronicity, and spirituality.&lt;br&gt;

The book The Meadow does not outline any particular totems that we have discussed on this blog in a definitive manner.
