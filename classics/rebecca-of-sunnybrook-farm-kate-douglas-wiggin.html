When they kindly agreed to take in the ten-year old daughter of a poor relation they never expected...Rebecca. Irrepressible and opinionated, Rebecca bursts into town like a bull in a china shop. The aunts do their best to turn Rebecca into a proper lady, but it may be easier to tame a wild horse! Rebecca has a mind very much her own and she has a real talent for mischief. She practically turns the sleepy town of Riverboro upside down. And happily, no one would have it any other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing about Rebecca: whenever and wherever she turns up, adventure is sure to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
