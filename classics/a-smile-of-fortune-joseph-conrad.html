  <title>A Smile of Fortune - Joseph Conrad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;A Smile of Fortune&amp;quot; is a masterly tale of misplaced loyalty, family feuds, and illicit bargaining.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Embarking in the tropics, a ship&amp;#39;s captain makes the instant acquaintance of a seemingly genial Mr. Jacobus and his irritable brother. One a respectable businessman with a considerable reputation, the other a confessed rogue and entrepreneur with no reputation left to lose, the captain is at a loss to determine which he should befriend. Yet as events unfold, he becomes increasingly in thrall to the less scrupulous of the two and finds himself the unwitting partner in a deeply unorthodox transaction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A masterpiece created by Joseph Conrad, best known for his chilling masterwork &amp;quot;Heart of Darkness&amp;quot; and placed by many critics as a forerunner of Modernism.&amp;nbsp;" />
