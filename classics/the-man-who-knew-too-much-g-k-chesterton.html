  <title>The Man Who Knew Too Much -  G. K. Chesterton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&amp;quot; is a classic British mystery written by G. K. Chesterton and appeared in 1922. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The eight short adventures in this classic &amp;nbsp;trace the activities of Horne Fisher, the man who knew too much, and his trusted friend Harold March. Although Horne&amp;#39;s keen mind and powerful deductive gifts make him a natural sleuth, his inquiries have a way of developing moral complications. Notable for their wit and sense of wonder, these tales offer an evocative portrait of upper-crust society in pre&amp;ndash;World War I England.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
G. K. Chesterton was an influential and prolific English writer of the early 20th century who is best known as the creator of detective-priest Father Brown (even though Chesterton&amp;#39;s mystery stories constitute only a small fraction of his writings)." />
