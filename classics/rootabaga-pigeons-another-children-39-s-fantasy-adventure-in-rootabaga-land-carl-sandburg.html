  <title>ROOTABAGA PIGEONS - Another Children&#39;s Fantasy Adventure in Rootabaga Land - Carl Sandburg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Carl Sandburg&amp;rsquo;s ROOTABAGA PIGEONS is the sequel to Rootabaga Stories.&lt;br /&gt;
This ebook is a most wonderful, magical flight of imagination that could ever be put in a printed format. Wonderfully whimsical in the same genre of Lewis Carroll&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&amp;rdquo;, and like Alice in Wonderland, this volume is not to be missed.&lt;br /&gt;
The whimsical, and sometimes melancholy stories, which often use nonsense language, were originally created for the three Sandburg daughters. The girl&amp;rsquo;s nicknames were &amp;ldquo;Spink&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Skabootch&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Swipes.&amp;rdquo; Each name appears in both Rootabaga stories, and offered here in the Rootabaga Pigeons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Rootabaga stories were born of Sandburg&amp;rsquo;s desire for American fairy tales to match American childhoods. He felt that the European stories involving royalty and knights were inappropriate in an American setting, and so set his stories in the fictionalized Rootabaga country-that closely resembles the American Midwest-a place filled with farms, trains, and corn fairies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A large number of the stories are told by the Potato Face Blind Man, an old minstrel from the &amp;ldquo;Village of Liver-and-Onions&amp;rdquo; who watches the world go by from in front of the local post office.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Originally published in 1923, the second volume of Carl Sandburg&amp;#39;s beloved Rootabaga Stories includes tales about &amp;quot;Big People Now&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Little People Long Ago.&amp;quot; The Pulitzer Prize-winning poet wrote these American fairy tales for his children while they were growing up in the American Midwest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
