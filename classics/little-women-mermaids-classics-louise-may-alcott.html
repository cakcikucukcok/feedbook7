Little Women was first published in two volumes in the years 1868 and 1869 and later as a single volume in 1880. It was a novel initially intended for girls and it steered away from the usual novels written for girls at the time but it was also considered a romance novel. Although the three major themes include domesticity, work and true love, the novel also contains issues of poverty, fear and pride. The novel became an instant success once it was first published and is considered today as one of the world&amp;#39;s best classics!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mermaids Classics, an imprint of Mermaids Publishing brings the very best of old classic literature to a modern era of digital reading by producing high quality books in ebook format.
