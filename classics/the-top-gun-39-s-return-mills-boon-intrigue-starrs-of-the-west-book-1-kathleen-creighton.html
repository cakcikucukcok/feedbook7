          &lt;strong&gt;Eight years ago, Jessie Bauer&#39;s life had changed forever. Now it was about to change back.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For the man she had loved with all her heart and soul - the one she had finally learned to live without - was coming home to her at last. Alive and in one piece - or was he? Military pilot Tristan Bauer had spent eight years in a living hell, not sure if he was dead or alive, with only the memory of his beautiful Jessie to keep him going.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now she was in front of him, his for the taking. If only he could. Because in every way that mattered, Tristan knew the husband he&#39;d been had died that day. And left his ghost in his place…&lt;/p&gt;
