Written in 1516, Utopia is a work of fiction and socio-political satire depicting a fictional island society and its religious, social, and political customs.&lt;br /&gt;

The name of the book has given an adjective to our language&amp;mdash;we call an impracticable scheme Utopian. Yet, under the veil of a playful fiction, the talk is intensely earnest, and abounds in practical suggestion. It is the work of a scholarly and witty Englishman, who attacks in his own way the chief political and social evils of his time." />
