  <title>The Will-o’-the-wisp - Baroness Emmuska Orczy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Will-o&amp;rsquo;-the-wisp&lt;/i&gt; was first published in 1947 during the last year of the author&amp;rsquo;s life. It is one of Orczy&amp;rsquo;s lesser known works and it has received very little attention from either critics or readers. The great success of the Scarlet Pimpernel series had provided the novelist with significant wealth, but she still enjoyed writing and chose to continue to produce books until close to her death. The title of her last novel arises from the phenomenon of atmospheric light of seeming unknown origins suddenly appearing. It is an occurrence which has an interesting history in folklore and is also known under a variety of other names, including Jack-&amp;rsquo;O-Lantern, Friar&amp;rsquo;s Lantern, Aleya, Boi-tata and &lt;i&gt;ignis fatuus&lt;/i&gt; (foolish fire).&lt;br /&gt;
The phenomenon has been interpreted by some folklore tales as a spirit or presence that arises over marshes and bogs in order to guide travellers away from the safe path and lead them into danger. British folktales variously describe it as a goblin, a pixie, a lost soul, or even a ghost; all of whom have nefarious intentions. In some Northern and Eastern European folklore traditions, it is a light that indicates the location of buried treasure. In literature, a will-o&amp;rsquo;-the-wisp occurs or is referenced either in relation to something sinister and unexplained, or it is employed to mean a sense of false hope; something that entices a fall in character and leads them to their misery or destruction." />

Baroness Orczy's sequels to the novel were less successful. She was also an artist, and her works were exhibited at the Royal Academy, London.<br /><b><i>The Will-o'-the-wisp by Emmuska Orczy - Goodreads</i></b> | I read Baroness Emmuska Orczy's first book, "The Scarlet Pimpernel," and I was immediately hooked with the character. Thus I was inclined to keep reading her next novels to know what happens in the adventurous life of the Scarlet Pimpernel. This book although not as brilliant as the first one, was still very interesting.<br /><b><i>I Will Repay: Orczy, Baroness Emmuska: 9781374817104 ...</i></b> | Early life. Emmuska Orczy was born in Tarnaörs, Heves County, Hungary, and was the daughter of composer Baron Félix Orczy de Orci (1835–1892) and Countess Emma Wass de Szentegyed et Cege (1839–1892). Her grandfather, Baron László Orczy (1787–1880) was a royal councillor, and knight of the Sicilian order of Saint George, her grandmother was the Baroness Magdolna Müller (1811–1879).<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Will-o’-the-wisp - Baroness Emmuska Orczy</a> </h3></p><hr/>
