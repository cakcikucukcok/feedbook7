  <title>Christmas Conspiracy (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) - Robin Perini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Four years ago, girl-next-door Kat Nelson had gone from being a tempting assignment to the fling&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;PI Logan Carmichael never forgot. Now he’d been hired to find her by a king claiming Kat was heir to the throne. Locating her wasn’t difficult. Learning he was the father of her toddler twins, however, made him ache.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But his job was to protect her from a madman who wanted her dead, and keep her away from the king who needed her alive. And yet one look at his children made the steely CIA vet yearn to be more than just a bodyguard.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Defusing bombs and taking out terrorists wasn’t as scary as being a father—and didn’t get his heart racing as much as the thought of spending every night by Kat’s side…&lt;/p&gt;
