  <title>Spoils - Brian Van Reet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is April 2003. American forces have taken Baghdad and are now charged with winning hearts and minds. But this vital tipping point is barely recognized for what it is, as a series of miscalculations and blunders fuels an already-simmering insurgency intent on making Iraq the next graveyard of empires. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In dazzling and propulsive prose, Brian Van Reet explores the lives on both sides of the battle lines: Cassandra, a nineteen-year-old gunner on an American Humvee who is captured during a deadly firefight and awakens in a prison cell; Abu Al-Hool, a lifelong mujahedeen beset by a simmering crisis of conscience as he struggles against enemies from without and within, including the new wave of far more radicalized jihadists; and Specialist Sleed, a tank crewman who goes along with a &quot;victimless&quot; crime, the consequences of which are more awful than any he could have imagined. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Depicting a war spinning rapidly out of control, destined to become a modern classic, &lt;i&gt;Spoils&lt;/i&gt; is an unsparing and morally complex novel that chronicles the achingly human cost of combat. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;The finest Iraq War novel yet written by an American&quot;-&lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;, 10 Best Novels of the Year &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;An electrifying debut&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt;) that maps the blurred lines between good and evil, soldier and civilian, victor and vanquished." />
