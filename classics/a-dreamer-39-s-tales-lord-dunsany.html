  <title>A Dreamer&#39;s Tales - Lord Dunsany</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Dreamer&amp;#39;s Tales is the fifth book by Irish fantasy writer Lord Dunsany, considered a major influence on the work of J. R. R. Tolkien, H. P. Lovecraft, Ursula K. Le Guin, and others.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book is actually Dunsany&amp;#39;s fourth major work, as his preceding book, The Fortress Unvanquishable, Save for Sacnoth (March, 1910), was a chapbook reprinting a single story from his earlier collection The Sword of Welleran and Other Stories (October, 1908).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In common with most of Dunsany&amp;#39;s early books, A Dreamer&amp;#39;s Tales is a collection of fantasy short stories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lord Dunsany (24 July 1878 &amp;ndash; 25 October 1957) was an Anglo-Irish writer and dramatist; his work, mostly in the fantasy genre, was published under the name Lord Dunsany. More than eighty books of his work were published, and his oeuvre includes many hundreds of published short stories, as well as successful plays, novels and essays.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He is best known for his 1924 fantasy novel The King of Elfland&amp;#39;s Daughter. He achieved great fame and success with his early short stories and plays, and during the 1910s was considered one of the greatest living writers of the English-speaking world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Born and raised in London, to the second-oldest title (created 1439) in the Irish peerage, Dunsany lived much of his life at what may be Ireland&amp;#39;s longest-inhabited house, Dunsany Castle near Tara, worked with W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory, received an honorary doctorate from Trinity College, Dublin, was chess and pistol-shooting champion of Ireland, and travelled and hunted extensively. He died in Dublin after an attack of appendicitis." />
