					&lt;strong&gt;A JOB HE COULDN&#39;T REFUSE&lt;/strong&gt;
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago Army Ranger Cameron Morgan left his family&#39;s ranch with no plans to return… until his job as a bodyguard reunited him with his former sweetheart and the life he&#39;d fled.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					&lt;strong&gt;A PAST HE COULDN&#39;T FORGET&lt;/strong&gt;
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Jennie Ward had been injured and her ranch sabotaged, so Cameron was critical to surviving an investigation that was getting riskier by the minute. But keeping his professional distance was nearly impossible, especially after Jennie nearly lost her life on his watch.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Still, as his need to guard her mixed with his hunger to find the truth, Cameron found it hard to resist the pull of his old life–not to mention Jennie&#39;s offer of a second chance…&lt;/p&gt;
