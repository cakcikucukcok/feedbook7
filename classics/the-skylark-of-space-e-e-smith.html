  <title>The Skylark of Space - E.E. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Skylark of Space by E.E. Smith was written between 1915 and 1921 while Smith was working on his doctorate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the beginning of the story, Seaton accidentally discovers a workable space drive in combining pure copper with a newly discovered element &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; (suggested to be a stable transactinide element in the platinum group) in solution. Having failed to re-create the effect, Seaton realizes that the missing component is a field generated by DuQuesne&amp;#39;s particle accelerator, and thereafter sets up a business with his millionaire friend, Martin Crane, to build a spaceship.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
DuQuesne conspires to sabotage Seaton&amp;#39;s spaceship and build his own from Seaton&amp;#39;s plans, which he uses to kidnap Seaton&amp;#39;s fianc&amp;eacute;e, Dorothy Vaneman, to exchange for the &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;. In the resulting fight, DuQuesne&amp;#39;s ship is accidentally set to full acceleration on an uncontrolled trajectory, until the copper &amp;#39;power bar&amp;#39; is exhausted at a vast distance from Earth&amp;#39;s solar system. Using an &amp;quot;Object Compass&amp;quot; that once locked on an object, always points toward that object, Seaton and Crane follow DuQuesne in their own spaceship (the eponymous Skylark) to rescue Dorothy and her fellow-hostage, Margaret &amp;quot;Peg&amp;quot; Spencer, until the Skylark discovers DuQuesne&amp;#39;s ship derelict in orbit around a massive dead star (resembling a cold neutron star).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Having obtained the hostages, Seaton extracts a promise from DuQuesne to &amp;quot;act as one of the party until they get back to Earth&amp;quot;, in which relationship they leave orbit and travel further in search of additional fuel. On an Earthlike exoplanet, they obtain &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; from an outcrop almost purely of that mineral; then leave that planet in search of copper.&amp;nbsp;" />
