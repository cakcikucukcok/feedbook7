        &lt;p&gt;And then he&#39;d broken her heart. So if it hadn&#39;t been for that pesky gunshot wound in her arm, Margo certainly wouldn&#39;t have found herself being held captive–for her own good, of course–in his house, his &lt;em&gt;bed&lt;/em&gt;, handcuffed to his gorgeous, naked body.&lt;/p&gt;
