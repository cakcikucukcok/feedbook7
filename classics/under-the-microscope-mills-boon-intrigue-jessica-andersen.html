          &lt;strong&gt;HIS JOB WAS TO PROTECT THE CLIENT, NOT FALL IN LOVE WITH HER…AGAIN&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Medical expert Raine Montgomery never dreamed the drug she created would be responsible for so many deaths. Suspicions on high alert, Raine was convinced someone was out to destroy her reputation–and her life. Turning to the best for help, Raine knew she and investigator Maximilian Vasek had to put aside their rocky history and focus on who wanted her eliminated….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Being around Raine reminded Max of a past he&#39;d tried hard to forget. Still, he couldn&#39;t ignore the vulnerability in her brown eyes, or the sizzling tension between them. Keeping her safe he could do. Walking away in the end might not be so easy….&lt;/p&gt;
