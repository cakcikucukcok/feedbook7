&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Excerpt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The sunbeams were playing hide and seek with the ripples around the prows of three small vessels lying at anchor in the harbor of Portsmouth. Their decks were crowded with the colonists going to seek a home on the soil of Virginia. On the wharf all was bustle and confusion. The songs of the sailors loading the vessels with the goods of the voyagers mingled with the whip and snap of the sails as they were given to the breeze.&lt;br /&gt;
