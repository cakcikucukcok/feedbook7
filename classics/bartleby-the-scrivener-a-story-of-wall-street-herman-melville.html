It is either a long short story or a short novella. 64 pages in my lovely Art of the Novella edition. This is among the last works of Melville and is considered as the first work in the emerging style known as naturalism.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Bartleby, The Scrivener A Story of Wall-Street ...</i></b> | It was more than 10 years ago when I first read Herman Melville’s Bartleby, a short story about an unwonted young man employed as a scrivener by a Wall Street lawyer. At that time, Bartleby struck me as a plain eccentric, imprudent worker who had the temerity to reject his boss’s orders.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Bartleby, The Scrivener: A Story of Wall-Street - Herman Melville</a> </h3></p><hr/>
