  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The Frozen Deep - Wilkie Collins</i></b> | The Frozen Deep is an 1856 play, originally staged as an amateur theatrical, written by Wilkie Collins under the substantial guidance of Charles Dickens. Dickens's hand was so prominent—beside acting in the play for several performances, he added a preface, altered lines, and attended to most of the props and sets—that the principal edition of the play is entitled "Under the Management of Charles Dickens".<br /><b><i>The Frozen Deep - Wikipedia</i></b> | Based on the doomed 1845 expedition to the Arctic, and originally performed as a play starring both Collins and Dickens, 'The Frozen Deep' is a dramatic tale of vengeance and self-sacrifice which went on to inspire the character of Sydney Carton in Charles Dickens' 'A Tale of Two Cities'.<br /><b><i>The Frozen Deep by Wilkie Collins - Goodreads</i></b> | The Frozen Deep is a novella based on a play that Wilkie Collins write, with changes by Charles Dickens. It is about a woman and the two men who want her and a trip to the North Pole (Arctic expeditions being big at the time). The Frozen Deep is much shorter than the Woman in White, or the Moonstone, so it can be read quickly.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Frozen Deep - Wilkie Collins</a> </h3></p><hr/>
