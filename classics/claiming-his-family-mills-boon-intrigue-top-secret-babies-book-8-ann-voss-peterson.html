          &lt;strong&gt;SECRET BABY&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alyson Fitzroy had a secret. A precious baby she struggled to protect, until the harrowing day her child was stolen! Now the only man she could turn to was Dex Harrington. The powerful D.A. who could put her baby&#39;s kidnapper behind bars forever. The lover who had fathered her child…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;DETERMINED DADDY&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dex Harrington was shocked to discover he had a son–and determined to keep his baby safe. Even if that meant taking matters into his own hands. Even if that meant allowing Alyson Fitzroy into his heart. Because as soon as he joined forces with the beauty he believed had betrayed him, he realized so much was at stake. For he hungered to claim this woman and child as his own once and for all!&lt;/p&gt;
