          &lt;strong&gt;THE LAST LANDRY&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Shane Landry&#39;s life was simple: He ran the Lucky 7 ranch and steered clear of his tempting housekeeper, Taylor Reese. The first was embedded in his blood, the second almost impossible to resist, considering Taylor slept right down the hall.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then everything changed. Shane&#39;s long-missing parents were discovered to have been murdered years ago and his paternity was suddenly put into question. As suspect number one in a double homicide, he had to clear his name…and only one woman could help.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Would Taylor be his salvation…or the last Landry&#39;s undoing?&lt;/p&gt;
