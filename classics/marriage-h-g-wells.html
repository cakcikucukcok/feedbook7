  <title>Marriage - H. G. Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Happy is good. Holy is better.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your marriage is more than a sacred covenant with another person. It is a spiritual discipline designed to help you know God better, trust him more fully, and love him more deeply. &amp;nbsp;What if God&amp;rsquo;s primary intent for your marriage isn&amp;rsquo;t to make you happy . . . but holy?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sacred Marriage doesn&amp;#39;t just offer techniques to make a marriage happier. It does contain practical tools, but what married Christians most need is help in becoming holier husbands and wives. Sacred Marriage offers that help with insights from Scripture, church history, time tested wisdom from Christian classics, and examples from today&amp;#39;s marriages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sacred Marriage reveals how marriage trains us to love God and others well, how it exposes sin and makes us more aware of God&amp;#39;s presence, how good marriages foster good prayer, how married sex feeds the spiritual life, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The revised edition of Sacred Marriage takes into account the ways men&amp;#39;s and women&amp;#39;s roles have expanded since the book was first written. It has been streamlined to be a faster read without losing the depth that so many readers have valued.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sacred Marriage uncovers the mystery of God&amp;rsquo;s overarching purpose. This book may very well alter profoundly the contours of your marriage. It will most certainly change you. Because whether it is delightful or difficult, your marriage can become a doorway to a closer walk with God, and to a spiritual integrity that, like salt, seasons the world around you with the savor of Christ." />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Marriage - H. G. Wells</i></b> | I've always known H.G. Wells as one of the earliest science fiction writers. This novel about a marriage during the Edwardian age of England illustrates the relationships between a husband and wife during those times. It is a peek into the thoughts, attitudes, and struggles between man and wife as they attempt to forge a life together.<br /><b><i>Marriage by H.G. Wells</i></b> | At 551 pages, Marriage is one of H.G. Wells's longest novels. Biographers have noted that Wells drew on his own experiences in describing Trafford's situation, but the inner life of this chaste hero bears little resemblance Wells's own turbulent private life.<br /><b><i>Marriage (novel) - Wikipedia</i></b> | Published 1812 A parable, I suppose one might call this story. One of the loops, folds, turns, tribulations of marriage. Full of struggle and hardship, near the finale Wells seeks to interject an Eastern intervention – quiet, away from the milling of the city, the noise, all the people, their money and petty personal issues and interference.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Marriage - H.
