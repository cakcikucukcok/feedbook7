  <title>John Jagon henki tahi kuollutko vai elävä? - Wilkie Collins Translated by Anton Oskar Forsman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="William Wilkie Collins (8 January 1824 &amp;ndash; 23 September 1889) was an English novelist, playwright, and short story writer. His best-known works are The Woman in White (1859), No Name (1862), Armadale (1866) and The Moonstone (1868). The last is considered the first modern English detective novel.&lt;br /&gt;
Born into the family of painter William Collins in London, he lived with his family in Italy and France as a child and learned French and Italian. He worked as a clerk for a tea merchant. After his first novel, Antonina, was published in 1850, he met Charles Dickens, who became a close friend, mentor and collaborator. Some of Collins&amp;#39;s works were first published in Dickens&amp;#39; journals All the Year Round and Household Words and the two collaborated on drama and fiction.&lt;br /&gt;
Collins published his best known works in the 1860s and achieved financial stability and an international reputation. During that time he began suffering from gout. After taking opium for the pain, he developed an addiction. During the 1870s and 1880s the quality of his writing declined along with his health." />
