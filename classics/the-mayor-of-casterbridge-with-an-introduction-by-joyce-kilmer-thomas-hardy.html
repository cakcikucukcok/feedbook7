  <title>The Mayor of Casterbridge (with an Introduction by Joyce Kilmer) - Thomas Hardy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Set in the fictional town of Casterbridge, “The Mayor of Casterbridge” is Thomas Hardy’s tragic story of Michael Henchard, who over indulges in alcohol at a country fair and decides to auction off his wife and daughter to a sailor. When he recovers his sobriety, Mr. Henchard realizes his mistake, but it is too late to get his family back. Devastated by his impetuous actions he decides not to touch alcohol again for the next twenty-one years. The novel advances eighteen years to find the tee-totaling Henchard as the Mayor of Casterbridge and a successful grain merchant. When his wife and daughter return to town a precipitous decline in Henchard’s fortune is set in motion. One of Hardy’s Wessex novels, “The Mayor of Casterbridge” is a classic story of the terrible consequences of rash decisions that can be made under the influence of too much alcohol. This edition includes an introduction by Joyce Kilmer and a biographical afterword." />
