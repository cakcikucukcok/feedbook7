  <title>The Spark / (The &#39;Sixties) - Edith Wharton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Note: Book 3 of &amp;quot;Old New York.&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hayley Delane, a schoolboy when the Civil War started, was wounded at Bull Run, and spent a long time recovering in a hospital camp in Washington. There he met a mysterious stranger, whose memory has stayed with him all these years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this novella, a young man is more or less obsessed with an older man (in a friendly slash mentorly kind of way). He is pained when the older man&amp;rsquo;s wife yells at his object of obsession, but he slowly starts to realize he doesn&amp;rsquo;t know as much about the man as he once thought. But this is comedic story, so it&amp;rsquo;s not a dark secret. Instead, he finds out that this older man had fought in the Civil War, a fact that shocks him because he never ever talks about ti. Indeed, he was wounded at Bull Run/Manassas, spent time in a Washington DC hospital, but now is mostly known to be a socialite and a polo player. That he never ever talks about his past alarms and intrigues the younger man.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a kind of funny story about stories, and how the stories themselves can be kind of disappointing if the person who lived them isn&amp;rsquo;t that into them themselves.&lt;br /&gt;
