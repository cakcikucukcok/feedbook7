Wells about an August 1895 cycling holiday, somewhat in the style of Three Men in a Boat. In 1922 it was adapted into a silent film The Wheels of Chance directed by Harold M. Shaw .<br /><b><i>The Wheels of Chance - Wikipedia</i></b> | However, Wells lacks Jerome's gift for comedy and The Wheels of Chance is an awkward book. Wells has no evident affection for Hoopdriver, his protagonist, or Jessie, the woman who accompanies him on much of his travels.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: The Wheels of Chance (9781438536729): Wells, H ...</i></b> | Although H. G. Wells is best known for his science fiction stories he wrote in many genres including history, and social commentaries. The Wheels of Chance was written when the bicycle was beginning to become very popular (1890 -1905) and saw bicycles becoming a part of social changes in England.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Wheels of Chance - H.
