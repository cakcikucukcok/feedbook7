  <title>Great Short Works of Mark Twain - Mark Twain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Selected works of humour and criticism by a revered American master.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beloved by millions, Mark Twain is the quintessential American writer. More than anyone else, his blend of scepticism, caustic wit and sharp prose defines a certain American mythos. While his novel &lt;em&gt;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&lt;/em&gt; is still taught to anyone who attends school and is considered by many to be the Great American Novel, Twain&#39;s shorter stories and criticisms have unequalled style and bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a review that&#39;s less than kind to the writing of James Fenimore Cooper, Twain writes: &quot;Every time a Cooper person is in peril, and absolute silence is worth four dollars a minute, he is sure to step on a dry twig. There may be a hundred handier things to step on, but that wouldn&#39;t satisfy Cooper. Cooper requires him to turn out and find a dry twig; and if he can&#39;t do it, go and borrow one.&quot; It&#39;s difficult to imagine anyone else writing in quite this style, which is why Twain&#39;s legacy only continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;" />
