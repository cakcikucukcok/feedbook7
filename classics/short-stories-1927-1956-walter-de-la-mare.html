  <title>Short Stories 1927-1956 - Walter De La Mare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The publication of Short Stories 1927-1956 celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of Walter de la Mare&#39;s death. It is also the culmination of a major literary enterprise. For many people Walter de la Mare (1873-1956) is as great a writer of fiction as of poetry. But the majority of his short stories, of which there are a hundred, have long been unavailable. Short Stories brings them all together in three volumes in the first comprehensive collection to be published. De la Mare&#39;s earliest published works were stories, and he continued writing and rewriting stories throughout the rest of his life. There was always a creative counterpoint between the themes and imagery of his prose and his poetry - such as the dream, childhood, the house, night, love lost and regained, solitude and the traveller.
