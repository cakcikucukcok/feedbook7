  <title>A Man of Mark - Anthony Hope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you are a fan of classic action-adventure stories who loved Anthony Hope&amp;#39;s The Prisoner of Zenda, A Man of Mark should be right up your alley. Set amidst a political uprising in the fictional country of Aureataland, this fast-paced romp is a rip-roaring read.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sir Anthony Hope Hawkins, better known as Anthony Hope (9 February 1863 &amp;ndash; 8 July 1933), was an English novelist and playwright. He was a prolific writer, especially of adventure novels but he is remembered predominantly for only two books: The Prisoner of Zenda (1894) and its sequel Rupert of Hentzau (1898). These works, &amp;quot;minor classics&amp;quot; of English literature, are set in the contemporaneous fictional country of Ruritania and spawned the genre known as Ruritanian romance, works set in fictional European locales similar to the novels. Zenda has inspired many adaptations, most notably the 1937 Hollywood movie of the same name." />
