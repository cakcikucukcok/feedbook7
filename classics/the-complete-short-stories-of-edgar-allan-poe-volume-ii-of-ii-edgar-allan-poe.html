  <title>The Complete Short Stories of Edgar Allan Poe (Volume II of II) - Edgar Allan Poe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;TRUE! nervous, very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad?&quot; And so begins &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;, that compressed tale of Gothic composition. The characters and images that Edgar Allan Poe has gifted us are plentiful.
Hugely influential to the short story genre, Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) remains a lion of American letters. His morose explorations of human depravity render his tales exceptionally captivating. Here, in Volume II of II, is contained &quot;A Predicament&quot;, &quot;Mystification&quot;, &quot;and Eleonora&quot;, among many others. Many acknowledge Poe&#39;s tales as prototypes for the later development of the horror, mystery, and science fiction genres. Poe&#39;s life is perhaps as fabled and shrouded in mystery as his stories. His cryptic death remains a source of myth. Poe was firmly established in the Gothic movement of the time and further was a father of &quot;dark romanticism&quot; which explored the psychology of torment and death. These stories are sure to arrest and transport the reader to the unique world of Edgar Allan Poe." />
