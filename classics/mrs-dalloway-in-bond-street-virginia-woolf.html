      <meta name="description" content="Mrs. Dalloway in Bond Street is a story by Virginia Woolf published in 1923. The work is full of reflections on the British society of the time and begins by describing Clarissa Dalloway, lady of English high society.

In a highly conventional and conventional world, in fact, it is always very difficult to express oneself for what one really is." />
