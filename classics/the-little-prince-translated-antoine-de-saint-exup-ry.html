  <title>The Little Prince (translated) - Antoine de Saint, Exupéry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Little Prince is a charming and wondrous book which will enchant both children and adults alike. It is a timeless parable for all ages, championing the beauty and wisdom of childhood which fades when one grows up.
The book describes his journey from planet to planet, each tiny world populated by a single adult. It&#39;s a wonderfully inventive sequence, which evokes not only the great fairy tales but also such monuments of postmodern whimsy as Italo Calvino&#39;s &quot;Invisible Cities&quot;. And despite his tone of gentle bemusement, Saint-Exupéry pulls off some fine satiric touches, too." />
