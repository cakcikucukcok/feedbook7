      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;Gulliver&#39;s Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World&lt;/em&gt; (with the original color illustrations by Arthur Rackham). In Four Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships, commonly known as GULLIVER&#39;S TRAVELS (1726, amended 1735), is a prose satire by Irish writer and clergyman Jonathan Swift, that is both a satire on human nature and a parody of the &quot;travellers&#39; tales&quot; literary subgenre. It is Swift&#39;s best known full-length work, and a classic of English literature. The book became popular as soon as it was published. John Gay wrote in a 1726 letter to Swift that &quot;It is universally read, from the cabinet council to the nursery.&quot; Since then, it has never been out of print.
