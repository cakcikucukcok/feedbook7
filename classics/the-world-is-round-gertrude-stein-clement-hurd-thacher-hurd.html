  <title>The World Is Round - Gertrude Stein, Clement Hurd, Thacher Hurd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Published to commemorate its 75th anniversary, &lt;em&gt;The World Is Round&lt;/em&gt; brings back into print the classic story created by Gertrude Stein and Clement Hurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written in her unique prose style, Gertrude Stein&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt; The World Is Round &lt;/em&gt; chronicles the adventures of a young girl named Rose&amp;#8212;a whimsical tale that delights in wordplay and sound while exploring the ideas of personal identity and individuality. This stunning volume replicates the original 1939 edition to a T, including all of Clement Hurd&amp;#39;s original blue-and-white art printed on the rose-pink paper that Stein insisted upon. Also featured here are two essays that provide an inside view to the making of the book. The first, a foreword by Clement Hurd&amp;#39;s son, author and illustrator Thacher Hurd, includes previously unpublished photographs and sheds light on a creative family life in Vermont, where his father and mother, author Edith Thacher Hurd, often collaborated on children&amp;#39;s books. The second essay, an afterword by Edith Thacher Hurd, takes readers behind the scenes of the making of &lt;em&gt;The World Is Round&lt;/em&gt;, including the numerous letters exchanged between Hurd and Stein as well as images of Stein with the real-life Rose and her white poodle, Love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
