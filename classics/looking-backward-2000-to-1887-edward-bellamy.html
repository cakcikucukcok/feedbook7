  <title>Looking Backward: 2000 to 1887 - Edward Bellamy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="LOOKING BACKWARD: 2000-1887 is a utopian science fiction novel by Edward Bellamy, a journalist and writer from Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts; it was first published in 1888. It was the third-largest bestseller of its time. It influenced a large number of intellectuals. Erich Fromm writes &quot;It is one of the few books ever published that created almost immediately on its appearance a political mass movement.&quot;
Bellamy&#39;s novel tells the story of a hero figure named Julian West, a young American who, towards the end of the 19th century, falls into a deep, hypnosis-induced sleep and wakes up one hundred and thirteen years later. He finds himself in the same location (Boston, Massachusetts), but in a totally changed world: It is the year 2000 and, while he was sleeping, the United States has been transformed into a socialist utopia. The remainder of the book outlines Bellamy&#39;s thoughts about improving the future. The major themes include problems associated with capitalism, a proposed socialist solution of a nationalization of all industry, the use of an &quot;industrial army&quot; to organize production and distribution, as well as how to ensure free cultural production under such conditions.
In the United States alone, over 162 &quot;Bellamy Clubs&quot; sprang up to discuss and propagate the book&#39;s ideas. Owing to its commitment to the nationalization of private property and the desire to avoid use of the odious term &quot;Socialism,&quot; this political movement came to be known as &quot;Nationalism&quot; -not to be confused with the political concept of nationalism. The novel also inspired several utopian communities." />
