  <title>The Life, Adventures &amp; Piracies Of The Famous Captain Singleton - Daniel Defoe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Life, Adventures and Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton (1720) is a novel by Daniel Defoe. It is believed to have been partly inspired by the exploits of English pirate Henry Every.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The narrative describes the life of an Englishman, stolen from a well-to-do family as a child and raised by Gypsies who eventually makes his way to sea.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One half of the book concerns Singleton&amp;#39;s crossing of Africa and the later half concerns his life as a pirate in the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea. Defoe&amp;#39;s description of piracy focuses for the most part on matters of economics and logistics, making it an intriguing if not particularly gripping read. Singleton&amp;#39;s pirate behaves more like a merchant adventurer, perhaps Defoe&amp;#39;s comment on the mercantilism of his day." />
