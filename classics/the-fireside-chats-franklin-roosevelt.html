  <title>The Fireside Chats - Franklin Roosevelt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fireside Chats is the term used to describe a series of 30 evening radio conversations (chats) given by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt between 1933 and 1944.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Roosevelt spoke with familiarity to millions of Americans about the promulgation of the Emergency Banking Act in response to the banking crisis, the recession, New Deal initiatives, and the course of World War II. On radio, he was able to quell rumors and explain his policies. His tone and demeanor communicated self-assurance during times of despair and uncertainty. Roosevelt was a great communicator on radio, and the fireside chats kept him in high public regard throughout his presidency.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The series of fireside chats was among the first 50 recordings made part of the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress, which noted it as &amp;quot;an influential series of radio broadcasts in which Roosevelt utilized the media to present his programs and ideas directly to the public and thereby redefined the relationship between President Roosevelt and the American people in 1933.&amp;quot;" />
