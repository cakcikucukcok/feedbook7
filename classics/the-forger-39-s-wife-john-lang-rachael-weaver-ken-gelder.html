  <title>The Forger&#39;s Wife - John Lang, Rachael Weaver, Ken Gelder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;John Lang was Australia&amp;#39;s first locally born novelist, publishing early work in Sydney in the 1840s and going on to write several bestsellers. &lt;em&gt;The Forger&amp;#39;s Wife&lt;/em&gt; (1856) is a lively adventure novel, set in an unruly colonial Sydney where everyone is on the make. The forger&amp;#39;s wife is a young woman who follows her rakish husband out to Australia and struggles to survive as her marriage falls apart. She soon meets detective George Flower, a powerful man with a cavalier sense of justice and retribution. Flower literally controls the fortunes of the colony: taking on the local bushrangers, instructing colonial authorities, and helping himself to the spoils along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First serialised in &lt;em&gt;Fraser&amp;#39;s Magazine&lt;/em&gt; in 1853, &lt;em&gt;The Forger&amp;#39;s Wife&lt;/em&gt; was popular in its day and was reprinted many times over. It is Australia&amp;#39;s first detective novel &amp;ndash; and most likely, the first detective novel in the Anglophone world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ebook edition includes an introduction by Ken Gelder and Rachael Weaver, and a translation of the appendix by Sophie Zins. The text includes both the lightly modernised text of the print edition as well as the unamended original text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;It is a powerful, if occasionally painful, book.
