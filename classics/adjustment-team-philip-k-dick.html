      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After getting held up on his way to work, Ed Fletcher worries about the repercussions he will face when he reaches his office. Little does he know that his late arrival will give him a glimpse behind the very fabric of human existence and put him at odds with powers he cannot comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip K. Dick was an American science-fiction novelist, short-story writer and essayist. His first short story, “Beyond Lies the Wub,” was published shortly after his high school graduation. “Adjustment Team” was adapted into the 2011 film &lt;em&gt;The Adjustment Bureau&lt;/em&gt;, starring Matt Damon and Emily Blunt.  Many of Philip K. Dick’s other stories have been similarly adapted, including “The Minority Report,” “Paycheck,” “Second Variety” (adapted into the film &lt;em&gt;Screamers&lt;/em&gt;) and “We Can Remember It For You Wholesale” (adapted into the film &lt;em&gt;Total Recall&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HarperCollins brings great works of literature to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and celebrating reading in all its forms.
