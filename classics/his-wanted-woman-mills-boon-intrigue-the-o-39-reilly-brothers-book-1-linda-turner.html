          &lt;strong&gt;Special agent Patrick O&#39;Reilly was determined not to let Mackenzie Sloan&#39;s good looks sway him from his task. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The woman&#39;s innocent persona didn&#39;t mean she wasn&#39;t involved in illegal activities. And after keeping track of her day–and night–for weeks, he&#39;d almost convinced himself his interest was all part of his job.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When the case placed Mackenzie in danger, he could no longer deny his duty had turned to desire. He&#39;d lay down his own life to protect this woman. But laying down his embattled heart might be the truest test of his resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
