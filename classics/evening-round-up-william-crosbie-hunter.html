  <title>Evening Round-Up - William Crosbie Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Each evening, just before retiring, we will have a little Round-Up of the day&#39;s doings, of the problems in our business and home life, of our hopes and ambitions.
We&#39;ll try to solve perplexities, dissolve worries, absolve ourselves from pull-backs, and resolve to better our lives.
We&#39;ll plan and prepare that we may have more poise—efficiency—peace; that&#39;s Pep.
We&#39;ll learn how to establish helpful thought habit that our lives may be full of gladsome notes instead of gruesome gloom.
We&#39;ll aim at
LIFE—LOVE—LAUGHTER?
These, then, are the purposes of this book.
