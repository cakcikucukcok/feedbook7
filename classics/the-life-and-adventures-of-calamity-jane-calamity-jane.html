  <title>The Life And Adventures Of Calamity Jane - Calamity Jane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Originally sold by the traveling Kohl &amp; Middleton Dime Museum as a short souvenir booklet, &lt;em&gt;The Life and Adventures of Calamity Jane by Herself&lt;/em&lt; details the sensational life of Martha Jane Canary, better known as Calamity Jane. Orphaned early in life, Jane provided for her young siblings by working as a frontier scout at Fort Russell, Wyoming. After building a reputation as a rough-rider and a gun-slinger, Jane settled in Deadwood, South Dakota, throwing her lot in with the likes of Wild Bill Hickok and the legendary Buffalo Bill, eventually appearing in Buffalo Bill&#39;s Wild West Show and in the 1901 Pan-American Exposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Life and Adventures of Calamity Jane by Herself&lt;/em&gt; is as wild and outlandish as the author herself, offering a unique perspective into a woman who lived her life outside of the conventions of her time. Famous during her life, Calamity Jane became larger than life after her death in 1903 and her legend lives on through contemporary media, including in the 2013 novel &lt;em&gt;In Calamity’s Wake&lt;/em&gt; by Natalee Caple, and as a character on the popular HBO series &lt;em&gt;Deadwood&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HarperPerennial Classics brings great works of literature to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and celebrating reading in all its forms.

It gives Calamity's history in almost outline form, and certainly left me wanting to know more.
