          &lt;strong&gt;GINNY MATTHEWS HAD A SIX-FOOT-ONE-INCH, COMPELLING REASON TO STAY AWAY FROM GOLD PEAK, OREGON: A LONG AND LEAN COWBOY BY THE NAME OF CULLY BLACK&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when her beloved foster parents were brutally murdered, Ginny knew she had no choice but to return. Facing her past–and long-buried feelings for the handsome sheriff who still owned her heart–was harder than she&#39;d anticipated. The long months of hiding had taken their toll and Ginny could feel a presence lurking in the shadows. Watching. Waiting. And soon, she became a killer&#39;s next target. She&#39;d have to once again place her trust in Cully, the only man who could keep her alive. But was his protective embrace part of his official duty…or something more?&lt;/p&gt;
