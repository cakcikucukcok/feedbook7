  <title>A Righted Wrong, Volume 1 (of 3) / A Novel. - Edmund Yates</title>

&lt;br /&gt;
He had not waited for words in reply to his farewell; she &amp;#39;could not have spoken them, and he knew it; and while she tried to make out his figure among the groups upon the deck, formed of those who were about to set forth upon the long perilous ocean voyage, and those who had come to bid them good-bye, some with hearts full of agony, a few careless and gay enough, a suffocating silence held her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But when at length she saw him for one brief moment as he went over the side to the boat waiting to take him to the shore so long familiar to her, but already, under the wonderful action of change, seeming strange and distant, the Spell was lifted off her, and a deep gasping sob burst from her lips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Frances Cashel Hoey, pseudonyms Cashel Hoey and Frances Cashel Hoey, was an Irish novelist, journalist and translator.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
According to Elizabeth Lee in the old Dictionary of National Biography, Hoey was also largely responsible for Land at Last (1866), Black Sheep (1867), Forlorn Hope (1867), Rock Ahead (1868), and A Righted Wrong (1870). These five novels were published under the name of Edmund Yates. Hoey was sole author of the last work. Eventually, the secret of her authorship was revealed, and she also helped Yates in 1874 to plan, and then write, The World. P. D. Edwards in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography describes this account, circulated by Anthony Trollope who held a grudge against Yates, as &amp;quot;probably spurious&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
