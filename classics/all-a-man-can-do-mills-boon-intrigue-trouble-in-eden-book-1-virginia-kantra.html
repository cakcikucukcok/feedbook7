          &lt;strong&gt;Words to live by for Jarek Denko, a man looking to forget his past and find his future in Eden. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He had a department to run, a daughter to raise and an investigation to solve. A relationship with any woman would be a distraction, but one with reporter Tess DeLucca - the sister of one of his prime suspects - could be his undoing. Getting up close and personal with Eden&#39;s new chief of police was part of her job.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So was remaining dispassionate, objective and in control - three things that might be possible if she trusted cops. And if she weren&#39;t so damn attracted to this one.&lt;/p&gt;
