          &lt;strong&gt;Olivia Capri knew giving birth to quads would cause a stir in her media-starved small town.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But she didn&#39;t realize it would bring back Zac Bishop, the boy she&#39;d once loved with all her teenaged heart. Luckily, as sheriff, he&#39;d returned just in time. It seemed someone was after her and her babies thanks to a past she knew nothing about.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And though she knew whoever it was didn&#39;t stand a chance against Zac and his protective nature, reminiscing about old times stirred up too many long-buried emotions. Still, Zac assured her everything would be okay, all she had to do was trust him. And she did. With everything but her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
