  <title>Island Landfalls: Reflections from the South Seas - Robert Louis Stevenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Selected and introduced by Jenni Calder.  Ill health drove Robert Louis Stevenson from Scotland; the urge for new and adventurous places drew him to the Pacific. There were those at home who would have been happier to see him purely as a spinner of the picturesque, but Stevenson could not close his eyes to the impact of colonialism, the &#39;stir-about of epochs and races, barbarisms and civilizations, virtues and crimes&#39;.  This collection sets three of his imaginative works -The Bottle Imp, The Isle of Voices, and The Beach of Falesa - within the social and political contexts of Stevenson&#39;s letters and essays from the South Seas. Island ambience, the clash of cultures, moral ambiguities, all are there, and so too is Stevenson&#39;s swift narrative control, giving a true modernity to his prose." />
