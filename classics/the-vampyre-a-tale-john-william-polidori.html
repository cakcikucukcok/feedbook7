  <title>The Vampyre a Tale - John William Polidori</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Vampyre a Tale by John William Polidori.&lt;/b&gt; This classic vampire story has inspired generations of authors, from Bram Stoker to Charlaine Harris. A young English gentleman of means, Aubrey is immediately intrigued by Lord Ruthven, the mysterious newcomer among society&amp;#39;s elite. His unknown origin and curious behavior tantalizes Aubrey&amp;#39;s imagination. But the young man soon discovers a sinister character hidden behind his new friend&amp;#39;s glamorous facade. When the two are set upon by bandits while traveling together in Europe, Ruthven is fatally injured. Before drawing his last breath, he makes the odd request that Aubrey keep his death and crimes secret for a year and a day. But when Ruthven resurfaces in London&amp;mdash;making overtures toward Aubrey&amp;#39;s sister&amp;mdash;Aubrey realizes this immortal fiend is a vampyre. John William Polidori&amp;#39;s The Vampyre is both a classic tale of gothic horror and the progenitor of the modern romantic vampire myth that has been fodder for artists ranging from Anne Rice to Alan Ball to Francis Ford Coppola. Originally published in 1819, many decades before Bram Stoker&amp;#39;s Dracula, and misattributed to Polidori&amp;#39;s friend Lord Byron, The Vampyre has kept readers up at night for nearly two hundred years." />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The Vampyre a Tale - John William Polidori</i></b> | "The Vampyre" is a short work of prose fiction written in 1819 by John William Polidori as part of a contest between Polidori, Mary Shelley, Lord Byron, and Percy Shelley. The same contest produced the novel Frankenstein. The Vampyre is often viewed as the progenitor of the romantic vampire genre of fantasy fiction.<br /><b><i>The Vampyre - Wikipedia</i></b> | Written at the same gathering at which Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein, Polidori’s “The Vampyre” is a short story of convoluted but beautiful sentences, mostly narrative, that condense what could easily be a novel, and it ends in tragedy and loss. Filming it would be superb, if Kubrick were alive.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: The Vampyre: A Tale (9781530088980): Polidori ...</i></b> | This is one of those weird bits of fiction where the story behind its creation is actually more interesting than the work itself: it was the result of a writing challenge between Mary Shelley, Byron and Polidori, the very same challenge that resulted in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. The tale begins with a vampire arriving in London; he catches the eyes of the citizens with his uniqueness.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Vampyre a Tale - John William Polidori</a> </h3></p><hr/>
