  <title>The Kama Sutra - Vatsyayana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Kama Sutra is an ancient Indian Hindu text widely considered to be the standard work on human sexual behavior in Sanskrit literature written by Vaatsyayana. A portion of the work consists of practical advice on sexual intercourse. It is largely in prose, with many inserted anustubh poetry verses. &amp;quot;Kama&amp;quot; which is one of the four goals of Hindu life, means desire including sexual desire the latter being the subject of the textbook, and &amp;quot;sutra&amp;quot; literally means a thread or line that holds things together, and more metaphorically refers to an aphorism (or line, rule, formula), or a collection of such aphorisms in the form of a manual. Contrary to popular perception, especially in the western world, Kama sutra is not exclusively a sex manual; it presents itself as a guide to a virtuous and gracious living that discusses the nature of love, family life and other aspects pertaining to pleasure oriented faculties of human life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Kama Sutra is the oldest and most notable of a group of texts known generically as Kama Shastra (Sanskrit: Kama Sastra).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Historians attribute Kamasutra to be composed between 400 BCE and 200 CE. John Keay says that the Kama Sutra is a compendium that was collected into its present form in the 2nd century CE." />
