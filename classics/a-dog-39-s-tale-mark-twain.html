  <title>A DOG&#39;S TALE - Mark Twain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A sentimental short story praised for its moving plot and condemnation of scientific experimentation on animals, Mark Twain efficiently delivers a truly captivating piece. First appearing in Harper&amp;rsquo;s Magazine in 1903, &lt;em&gt;A Dog&amp;#39;s Tale &lt;/em&gt;was later published as a pamphlet for the National Anti-Vivisection Society. The tale focuses on the life of Aileen, a misunderstood dog who experiences the ups and downs of life, while cruelly subjected to suffering because of the shallow belief of her inferiority amidst humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is told from the point of view of Aileen Mavourneen, a self-proclaimed Presbyterian, whose mother is a Collie, and father is a St. Bernard. The story begins with Aileen&amp;rsquo;s life as a puppy, living together with her mother until she is later taken in by a loving family. Life at her new home seems perfect, as she lives in a well adorned house, and has an open space where she is free to roam and play with other dogs. Subsequently, the household welcomes the arrival of the owner&amp;rsquo;s baby and Aileen&amp;rsquo;s puppy, which adds joy to the home. However, the idyllic days are brought to a halt when a terrible accident occurs, prompting Aileen to risk her own life to save her owner&amp;rsquo;s infant from harm&amp;rsquo;s way. Despite the heroic deed, Aileen is rewarded with the utmost brutality that changes her life forever. A compelling piece of literature, &lt;em&gt;A Dog&amp;#39;s Tale &lt;/em&gt;efficiently depicts the dark and inconsiderate nature of humans, which is contrasted with the benign and loyal nature of dogs. Guaranteed to make one&amp;rsquo;s heart tingle, the short story evokes many powerful emotions throughout its short, yet overpowering pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twain successfully creates a piece that will captivate its audience, leaving them incapable of feeling indifferent to such a powerful message presented in the piece. Furthermore, Twain&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness to illustrate the inhumane and inconsiderate treatment of animals is heightened by allowing the audience to enter the mind of a dog and observe and feel life on the other side of the coin. Supplying a generous serving of humor, irony, love, cruelty, and heartfelt moments, &lt;em&gt;A Dog&amp;#39;s Tale &lt;/em&gt;encourages humanity to take a step back and carefully reflect on their actions and reconsider the roles played by both humans and animals in society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Audio Book of this title is also available for free at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iboo.com/en/audio-books&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;www.iboo.com/en/audio-books&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
