Later in life, he also wrote plays and essays. His two most famous works &amp;mdash; &amp;#39;War and Peace&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Anna Karenina&amp;#39;, are acknowledged as two of the greatest novels of all time and a pinnacle of realist fiction. Many consider Tolstoy to have been one of the world&amp;#39;s greatest novelists. Tolstoy is equally known for his complicated and paradoxical persona and for his extreme moralistic and ascetic views, which he adopted after a moral crisis and spiritual awakening in the 1870s, after which he also became noted as a moral thinker and social reformer.&lt;br /&gt; His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him in later life to become a fervent Christian anarchist and anarcho-pacifist. His ideas on non-violent resistance, expressed in such works as &amp;#39;The Kingdom of God is Within You&amp;#39;, were to have a profound impact on such pivotal twentieth-century figures as Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.&lt;/p&gt;" />
