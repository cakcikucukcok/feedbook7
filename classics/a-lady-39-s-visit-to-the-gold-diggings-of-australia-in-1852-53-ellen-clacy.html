  <title>A Lady&#39;s Visit to the Gold Diggings of Australia in 1852-53 - Ellen Clacy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you have visions of a middle-aged parasol-bearing lady smiling sweetly from her carriage as she tours Bendigo think again. In 1852, 20 year old clergyman&amp;rsquo;s daughter Ellen and her brother boarded ship for Melbourne then set off to walk to Bendigo. Dressed in her blue serge skirt which doubled as nightwear, she camped under a tent made of blankets, had mutton, damper and tea most meals and on arrival lent her hand to gold washing. And seemed to enjoy it ! And amongst other things she tells of colonial life , transportation, emigration and other gold-fields. But you will need to listen to hear more about bush-rangers and orphans as well as what she did with her parasol.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ellen Clacy (1830&amp;ndash;1901) is best known for her account of A Lady&amp;#39;s Visit to the Gold Diggings of Australia in 1852&amp;ndash;1853.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Born in 1830 in Richmond, Surrey, England, one of 5 children of clergyman Frederick Sturmer and Mary Norris.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1852 she travelled to Australia with her eldest brother to seek their fortunes on the goldfields of Victoria.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clacy returned to England by ship without her brother a couple of months after arriving in Melbourne, and gave birth to her daughter, also called Ellen Louise Clacy, on board ship during the return journey.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After her return from Australia, Clacy began writing under the pseudonym &amp;quot;Cycla&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1854, she married Charles Berry Clacy, a merchant&amp;#39;s clerk and mining engineer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There seems to be some indication that she was abandoned by her husband, and she was said to support herself by writing articles for newspapers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ellen Clacy died in London in 1901." />
