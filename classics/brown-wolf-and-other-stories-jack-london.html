  <title>Brown Wolf and Other Stories - Jack London</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Classic Jack London - Brown Wolf was first published in Everybody&amp;#39;s Magazine then later released in this collection by editors who felt a great demand for London&amp;#39;s American-pioneer writing style.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;BROWN WOLF &lt;/b&gt;(excerpt)&lt;br /&gt;
She had delayed, because of the dew-wet grass, in order to put on her overshoes, and when she emerged from the house found her waiting husband absorbed in the wonder of a bursting almond-bud. She sent a questing glance across the tall grass and in and out among the orchard trees.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Where&amp;#39;s Wolf?&amp;quot; she asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;He was here a moment ago.&amp;quot; Walt Irvine drew himself away with a jerk from the metaphysics and poetry of the organic miracle of blossom, and surveyed the landscape. &amp;quot;He was running a rabbit the last I saw of him.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Wolf! Wolf! Here, Wolf!&amp;quot; she called, as they left the clearing and took the trail that led down through the waxen-belled manzanita jungle to the county road.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Irvine thrust between his lips the little finger of each hand and lent to her efforts a shrill whistling.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She covered her ears hastily and made a wry grimace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;My! for a poet, delicately attuned and all the rest of it, you can make unlovely noises. My eardrums are pierced. You outwhistle----&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Orpheus.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I was about to say a street-arab,&amp;quot; she concluded severely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Poesy does not prevent one from being practical--at least it doesn&amp;#39;t prevent me. Mine is no futility of genius that can&amp;#39;t sell gems to the magazines.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He assumed a mock extravagance, and went on:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I am no attic singer, no ballroom warbler. And why? Because I am practical. Mine is no squalor of song that cannot transmute itself, with proper exchange value, into a flower-crowned cottage, a sweet mountain-meadow, a grove of redwoods, an orchard of thirty-seven trees, one long row of blackberries and two short rows of strawberries, to say nothing of a quarter of a mile of gurgling brook.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh, that all your song-transmutations were as successful!&amp;quot; she laughed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Name one that wasn&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Those two beautiful sonnets that you transmuted into the cow that was accounted the worst milker in the township.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;She was beautiful----&amp;quot; he began.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But she didn&amp;#39;t give milk,&amp;quot; Madge interrupted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But she was beautiful, now, wasn&amp;#39;t she?&amp;quot; he insisted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And here&amp;#39;s where beauty and utility fall out,&amp;quot; was her reply. &amp;quot;And there&amp;#39;s the Wolf!&amp;quot;...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;About Jack London:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jack London (1876-1916), was an American author and a pioneer in the then-burgeoning world of commercial magazine fiction. He was one of the first Americans to make a lucrative career exclusively from writing. London was self-educated. He taught himself in the public library, mainly just by reading books. In 1898, he began struggling seriously to break into print, a struggle memorably described in his novel, Martin Eden (1909). Jack London was fortunate in the timing of his writing career. He started just as new printing technologies enabled lower-cost production of magazines. This resulted in a boom in popular magazines aimed at a wide public, and a strong market for short fiction. In 1900, he made $2,500 in writing, the equivalent of about $75,000 today. His career was well under way.&lt;br /&gt;
