  <title>Biosensors and Nanotechnology - Zeynep Altintas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Provides a broad range of information from basic principles to advanced applications of biosensors and nanomaterials in health care diagnostics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book utilizes a multidisciplinary approach to provide a wide range of information on biosensors and the impact of nanotechnology on the development of biosensors for health care. It offers a solid background on biosensors, recognition receptors, biomarkers, and disease diagnostics. An overview of biosensor-based health care applications is addressed. Nanomaterial applications in biosensors and diagnostics are included, covering the application of nanoparticles, magnetic nanomaterials, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and molecularly imprinted nanostructures. The topic of organ-specific health care systems utilizing biosensors is also incorporated to provide deep insight into the very recent advances in disease diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Biosensors and Nanotechnology: Applications in Health Care Diagnostics&lt;/i&gt; is comprised of 15 chapters that are presented in four sections and written by 33 researchers who are actively working in Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Turkey, Denmark, Finland, Romania, Malaysia and Brazil. It covers biomarkers in healthcare; microfluidics in medical diagnostics; SPR-based biosensor techniques; piezoelectric-based biosensor technologies; MEMS-based cell counting methods; lab-on-chip platforms; optical applications for cancer cases; and more. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Discusses the latest technology and advances in the field of biosensors and their applications for healthcare diagnostics&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Particular focus on biosensors for cancer&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Summarizes research of the last 30 years, relating it to state-of-the-art technologies&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Biosensors and Nanotechnology: Applications in Health Care Diagnostics&lt;/i&gt; is an excellent book for researchers, scientists, regulators, consultants, and engineers in the field, as well as for graduate students studying the subject.&lt;/p&gt;" />
