  <title>Dawn of the New Everything - Jaron Lanier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Named one of the best books of 2017 by &lt;i&gt;The Economist, The Wall Street Journal, &lt;/i&gt;&amp; &lt;i&gt;Vox&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The father of virtual reality explains its dazzling possibilities by reflecting on his own lifelong relationship with technology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bridging the gap between tech mania and the experience of being inside the human body&lt;i&gt;, Dawn of the New Everything&lt;/i&gt; is a look at what it means to be human at a moment of unprecedented technological possibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a fascinating look back over his life in technology, Jaron Lanier, an interdisciplinary scientist and father of the term &quot;virtual reality,&quot; exposes VR&#39;s ability to illuminate and amplify our understanding of our species, and gives readers a new perspective on how the brain and body connect to the world. An inventive blend of autobiography, science writing, philosophy and advice, this book tells the wild story of his personal and professional life as a scientist, from his childhood in the UFO territory of New Mexico, to the loss of his mother, the founding of the first start-up, and finally becoming a world-renowned technological guru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding virtual reality as being both a scientific and cultural adventure, Lanier demonstrates it to be a humanistic setting for technology. While his previous books offered a more critical view of social media and other manifestations of technology, in this book he argues that virtual reality can actually make our lives richer and fuller.&lt;/p&gt;" />

His previous books "Who owns the future" and "You are not a gadget" were more intriguing and engaging to read. Dawn of the new everything is an interesting perspective on VR and what possibilities it might involve, and the directions in which it probably should go.<br /><b><i>Dawn of the New Everything: Encounters with Reality and ...</i></b> | “Dawn of the New Everything spirits us back to a time when a plurality of ideas about what the Internet could be were still in play . . . it pulses with kaleidoscopic insight. . .
