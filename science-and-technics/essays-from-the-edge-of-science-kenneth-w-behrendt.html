  <title>Essays from the Edge of Science - Kenneth W. Behrendt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Essays from the Edge of Science is author and researcher Kenneth W. Behrendts latest contribution to the literature of the New Age. It is an exciting and insightful analysis of various topics that takes the reader from the depths of our planets oceans to the farthest reaches of cosmic space and time while outlining what will most likely be accepted science by the end of this century.
Youll learn about the astonishing telepathic powers of the so-called lower animals. An entire chapter is devoted to the living subterrestrial creatures that inhabit the Earths crust and whose highly evolved paranormal powers are responsible for many of the events taking place in haunted houses. The soon coming elimination of fossil fuels and their replacement by free energy devices that use the power of permanent magnets is discussed. Even the nature of time as well as a means to travel through it is explored as the reader is taken on an imaginary ride aboard what could be the first truly functional time machine. In a highly controversial chapter, the author finally gives the real reason that our planets major governments dare not reveal what they know about the UFO phenomenon! All this, however, is only a small sample of what awaits one in this incredible work.
This book is sure to fascinate the general reader who has always suspected that what we have been taught is real is, in fact, only a very small portion of a much larger and stranger reality. Now that rarely seen hidden reality is exposed so that it can finally be a subject for serious scientific inquiry." />
