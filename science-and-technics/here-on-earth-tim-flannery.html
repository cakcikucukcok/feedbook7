  <title>Here on Earth - Tim Flannery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Credited with discovering more species than Darwin, praised for his &amp;#147;ability to take complex ideas and&amp;#151;seemingly effortlessly&amp;#151; make them accessible&amp;#8221; (&lt;I&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/I&gt;), Tim Flannery is one of the world&amp;#8217;s most influential scientists, head of Australia&amp;#8217;s Climate Change Commission, and a best-selling author. In his newest book, &lt;I&gt;Here on Earth&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#151;an immediate best seller in Australia&amp;#151;he has written a captivating and dramatic narrative about the origins of life and the history of our planet.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beginning at the moment of creation with the Big Bang, &lt;I&gt;Here on Earth&lt;/I&gt; explores the evolution of Earth from a galactic cloud of dust and gas to a planet with a metallic core and early signs of life within a billion years of being created. In a compelling narrative, Flannery describes the formation of the Earth&amp;#8217;s crust and atmosphere, as well as the transformation of the planet&amp;#8217;s oceans from toxic brews of metals (such as iron, copper, and lead) to life-sustaining bodies covering 70 percent of the planet&amp;#8217;s surface. Life, Flannery shows, first appeared in these oceans in the form of microscopic plants and bacteria, and these metals served as catalysts for the earliest biological processes known to exist. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From this starting point, Flannery tells the story of the evolution of our own species, exploring several early human species&amp;#151;from the diminutive creatures (the famed hobbits) who lives in Africa around two million years ago, to Homo erectus&amp;#151;before durning his attention to Homo sapiens, who first started leaving Africa some fifty thousand years ago. Drawing on Charles Darwin&amp;#8217;s and Alfred Russell Wallace&amp;#8217;s theories of evolution and Lovelock&amp;#8217;s Gaia hypothesis, Tim Flannery&amp;#8217;s &lt;I&gt;Here on Earth&lt;/I&gt; is a dazzling account of life on our planet. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also available:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Eternal Frontier&lt;/I&gt;		&lt;I&gt;Throwim Way Leg&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Future Easters&lt;/I&gt;		&lt;I&gt;The Weather Makers&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
