  <title>Earthbag Building - Kaki Hunter, Donald Kiffmeyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;P&gt;Over 70 percent of Americans cannot afford to own a code-enforced, contractor-built home. This has led to widespread interest in using natural materials&amp;mdash;straw, cob, and earth&amp;mdash;for building homes and other buildings that are inexpensive, and that rely largely on labor rather than expensive and often environmentally-damaging outsourced materials.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Earthbag Building&lt;/I&gt; is the first comprehensive guide to all the tools, tricks, and techniques for building with bags filled with earth&amp;mdash;or earthbags. Having been introduced to sandbag construction by the renowned Nader Khalili in 1993, the authors developed this &quot;Flexible Form Rammed Earth Technique&quot; over the last decade. A reliable method for constructing homes, outbuildings, garden walls and much more, this enduring, tree-free architecture can also be used to create arched and domed structures of great beauty&amp;mdash;in any region, and at home, in developing countries, or in emergency relief work.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This profusely illustrated guide first discusses the many merits of earthbag construction, and then leads the reader through the key elements of an earthbag building:&lt;br&gt; Special design considerations&lt;BR&gt; Foundations, walls and floors&lt;BR&gt; Electrical, plumbing and shelving&lt;BR&gt; Lintels, windows and door installations&lt;BR&gt; Roofs, arches and domes&lt;BR&gt; Exterior and interior plasters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With dedicated sections on costs, making your own specialized tools, and building code considerations, as well as a complete resources guide, &lt;I&gt;Earthbag Building&lt;/I&gt; is the long-awaited, definitive guide to this uniquely pleasing construction style.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kaki Hunter and Donald Kiffmeyer have been involved in the construction industry for the last 20 years, specializing in affordable, low-tech, low-impact building methods that are as natural as possible.
