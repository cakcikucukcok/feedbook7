  <title>Transplant Story - Philip G. Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A novel of action, anguish, poignant humor 
and ultimate hope as two complete strangers are brought together in a medical miracle

In lucid prose Transplant Story clarifies difficult medical concepts and procedures and examines the historical, political, and legal factors surrounding transplantation in India today. Through an unforgettable cast of characters, Transplant Story asks you to explore the deep mysteries of human life: what it means to love, to give, to sacrifice, to hopewhat it means to make medical miracles possible." />
