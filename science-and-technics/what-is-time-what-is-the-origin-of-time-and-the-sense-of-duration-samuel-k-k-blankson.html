  <title>What is TimE - What is the Origin of Time and the Sense of DuratioN - Samuel K.K. Blankson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The cosmos itself is not governed or regulated by time but by chance, so cosmology can never appear consistently logical. Time and regulation are human concepts. The &#39;points and instants&#39; notion is no longer credible. Points are our basic intellectual tools since the instants arise through moving from point to point, making time discrete. A.N. Whitehead&#39;s definition of time as &quot;a sequence of non-interacting moments&quot; is credible. Russell also said &quot;There is no longer a universal time...&quot; And Professor Eddington observed that time does not &#39;flow&#39;. The Minkowski 4-D geometry is seen as plainly false, and so time travel is impossible. There are no days in nature at all. There is only one constant day. All existence is daylight. The nights are freakish and irrelevant. The earth&#39;s rotations are just flippant shadows over reality. Nothing in astronomy happens only by night and not by day. Logically deduced, time appears to be human and we can solve the problem of how it passes by, too.&quot;" />
