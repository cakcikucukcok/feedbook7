  <title>Kitaaba Wal-Hikmata - Jamir Ahmed Choudhury</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Was-Salaamu alaa manit-tabaal Hudaa, 
They (Muusa and Haarun) said, Our Rab! We fear lest he [Firawn] hasten with insolence against us, or lest he transgress all bounds. 
He said, Fear not, for I am with you. I hear and see [everything]. So go you both to him (owner of Windows 7 Ultimate) and say, Verily we are messengers [Rasuula Rabbika] sent by your Rab. Send forth, therefore, Bani-Israa-iil [those who had made covenant with Allah on the right side of Mount Tuur over water] with us and afflict them not. We bring you a clear proof from your Rab [bi-Aayatim-mir-Rabbik] and peace to all who follow right guidance [Was-Salaamu alaa manit-tabaal Hudaa]. Verily it has been revealed to us that the penalty awaits those who reject manifest truth / clear proof and turn away from right guidance [annal-Azaaba alaa man kazzaba wa tawallaa] (Sura [19]Taa-Haa45 to 48).
