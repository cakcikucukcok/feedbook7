  <title>Past, Present and Future As Time In the Age of Science - Second Edition - Samuel K. K. Blankson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is about the post-relativity philosophy of time as championed by Bertrand Russell and Einstein. It argues that The Past, Present and Future notion of time is an illusion. The sun, as daylight, is on constantly with no temporal past and future, except in chemistry perhaps. Only the earth&#39;s revolutions bring temporary days and nights. So the Bertrand Russell notion that under relativity man constructs his time is logically unassailable (the days, weeks, months and years are all human concepts.) Relativity allows time to begin from anywhere.  So the revolutionary view is that there are or can be as many times as there are frames, or planets---a world-changing idea but true because it is based on objective, physical experiments, but generally ignored." />
