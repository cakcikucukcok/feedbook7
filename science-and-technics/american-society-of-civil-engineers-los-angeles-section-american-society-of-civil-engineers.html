The Centennial year is highlighted herein with photos of the many celebratory activities held by the ASCE Los Angeles Section, its Branches, Younger Member Forums, Life Member Forums and Student Branches from Oct. 2012 through December 2013. Articles authored by various civil engineering leaders are included as posted on the Section website throughout the 2013 year describing various forms of civil engineering infrastructure in the region. Additionally, as the second largest Section in the ASCE Society and covering most of the Southern California, southern San Joaquin valley and much of the eastern portion of California, the founding of this remarkable organization is described including profiles of many of the civil engineering leaders who supported ASCE and civil engineering projects that provide the quality of life so many enjoy in Southern California today. A Section Timeline and Civil Engineering Landmarks Review is also included that provides important historical reference for how far we have come over the past century. Together, the remarkable Centennial year for the Section highlights the extraordinary contributions that civil engineers have made, and will continue to make, for generations to come." />
