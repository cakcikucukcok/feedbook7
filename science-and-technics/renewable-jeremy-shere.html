  <title>Renewable - Jeremy Shere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where does the energy we use come from? It&#39;s absolutely vital to every single thing we do every  day, but for most people, it is utterly invisible. Flick a switch and the lights go on. It might as well be magic. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science writer Jeremy Shere shows us in &lt;i&gt;Renewable: The World-Changing Power&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of Alternative Energy&lt;/i&gt; that energy is anything but magical. Producing it in fossil fuel form is a dirty, expensive--but also hugely profitable-- enterprise, with enormous but largely hidden costs to the entire planet. The cold, hard fact is that at some point we will have wrung the planet dry of easily accessible sources of fossil fuel. And when that time comes, humankind will have no choice but to turn--or, more accurately, return--to other, cleaner, renewable energy sources. What will those sources be? How far have we come to realizing the technologies that will make these sources available?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find the answers, Shere began his journey with a tour of a traditional coal-fueled power plant in his home state of Indiana. He then continued on, traveling from coast to coast as he spoke to scientists, scholars and innovators. He immersed himself in the green energy world: visiting a solar farm at Denver&#39;s airport, attending the Wind Power Expo and a wind farm tour in Texas, investigating turbines deep in New York City&#39;s East River, and much more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arranged in five parts--Green Gas, Sun, Wind, Earth, and Water--&lt;i&gt;Renewable&lt;/i&gt; tells the stories of the most interesting and promising types of renewable energy: namely, biofuel, solar, wind, geothermal, and hydropower. But unlike many books about alternative energy, &lt;i&gt;Renewable&lt;/i&gt; is not obsessed with megawatts and tips for building home solar panels. Instead, Shere digs into the rich, surprisingly long histories of these technologies, bringing to life the pioneering scientists, inventors, and visionaries who blazed the way for solar, wind, hydro, and other forms of renewable power, and unearthing the curious involvement of great thinkers like Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and Nicola Tesla.&lt;br&gt;We are at an important crossroads in the history of renewable technologies. The possibilities are endless and enticing, and it has become increasingly clear that renewable energy is the way of the future. In &lt;i&gt;Renewable&lt;/i&gt;, Jeremy Shere&#39;s natural curiosity and serious research come together in an entertaining and informative guide to where renewable energy has been, where it is today, and where it&#39;s heading.&lt;/p&gt;" />
