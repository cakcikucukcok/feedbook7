  <title>Michael Monkey Saves the Day - L.D. Dockery, Roger McCloud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book (the second in a series) is dedicated to those who have gone the distance
in promoting children to read. It is to:
 teachers who struggled with those like me and had the courage to dictate, demand,
and encourage reading
 parents who read to their children and with their children and will hopefully apply this
book to such
 the child who would dare to read, if but for a moment each day, noting words he or
she fails to recognize and refusing to shy away in the midst of his/her peers in his/her
quest to find answers
 my mother, Algia B. Dockery, who, in her own right, was a gifted poet and reader of
children stories that put me asleep as well as awakened my spirits to poetry (with
rhyme) and the sense of a world of children as seen through animal characters that
make the world attractive and inviting to them
 those who ventured with my children, encouraged them to read, and honed their
reading skills as well as being associates who helped guide my thoughts in ways they
perhaps have not conceived or recognized all of which are English teachers I have
come to respect.
Special thanks to Mrs. Margie Grissett, Mrs. Sheila C. Powell, and Mrs. Selena B. Rowell." />
