  <title>The Fossil Hunter - Shelley Emling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;At a time when women were excluded from science, a young girl made a discovery that marked the birth of paleontology and continues to feed the debate about evolution to this day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary Anning was only twelve years old when, in 1811, she discovered the first dinosaur skeleton--of an ichthyosaur--while fossil hunting on the cliffs of Lyme Regis, England. Until Mary&#39;s incredible discovery, it was widely believed that animals did not become extinct. The child of a poor family, Mary became a fossil hunter, inspiring the tongue-twister, &quot;She Sells Sea Shells by the Seashore.&quot; She attracted the attention of fossil collectors and eventually the scientific world. Once news of the fossils reached the halls of academia, it became impossible to ignore the truth. Mary&#39;s peculiar finds helped lay the groundwork for Charles Darwin&#39;s theory of evolution, laid out in his &lt;i&gt;On the Origin of Species.&lt;/i&gt; Darwin drew on Mary&#39;s fossilized creatures as irrefutable evidence that life in the past was nothing like life in the present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A story worthy of Dickens, &lt;i&gt;The Fossil Hunter&lt;/i&gt; chronicles the life of this young girl, with dirt under her fingernails and not a shilling to buy dinner, who became a world-renowned paleontologist. Dickens himself said of Mary: &quot;The carpenter&#39;s daughter has won a name for herself, and deserved to win it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here at last, Shelley Emling returns Mary Anning, of whom Stephen J. Gould remarked, is &quot;probably the most important unsung (or inadequately sung) collecting force in the history of paleontology,&quot; to her deserved place in history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
