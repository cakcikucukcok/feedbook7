  <title>Sticks &amp; Stones / Steel &amp; Glass - Anthony Poon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In this personal and revealing book, Anthony Poon takes us on a creative journey that begins with his re-envisioning of a seaside public space as a very young architect. Poon has designed hundreds of buildings across the United States and internationally, from eco-friendly homes to public schools, from intimate retail venues and restaurants to sports arenas, from university housing to retreats and places of worship.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Sticks &amp; Stones / Steel &amp; Glass&lt;/I&gt; takes us inside a purposive yet open mind always hoping to &amp;#147;design it all,&amp;#8221; to weave together light and material, culture and commerce, music and design, a good meal and the joy of gathering to share it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In these pages we engage the creative processes of a thoughtful and intense architect whose works&amp;#151;public and private&amp;#151;all strive to enhance his clients&amp;#8217; stories and identities. Poon&amp;#8217;s goal in each commission is to reward those who will enjoy and inhabit the structures he designs. In every building designed by Anthony Poon art is shelter and architecture is a social good.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
