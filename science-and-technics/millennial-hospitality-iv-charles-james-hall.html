  <title>Millennial Hospitality Iv - Charles James Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the first three volumes of his memoirs concerning experiences while serving at Nellis Air Force Base, Charles Hall gave astonishing testimony of having met with &#39;Tall White&#39; extraterrestrials located at a secret underground facility at Nellis.
&lt;br&gt;
Three independent witnesses have come forward to confirm important parts of Hall&#39;s testimony. Hall is a credible witness of extraterrestrials having reached agreements with military officials.
&lt;br&gt;
This fourth volume offers more startling details that help confirm his experiences and help usher in new era of official disclosure of extraterrestrial life.
&lt;br&gt;
Micheal E. Salla, Ph.D. President and Founder, The Exopolitics Institute
&lt;br&gt;
Charles Hall&#39;s report (Millennial Hospitality I-III) of his encounters and deep interactions with tall humanoid beings living on the Earth remains without serious challenge to this day. And this is remarkable, as its implications are so radical; they reveal an entrenched presence in the American Southwest that predates the arrival of Euro-Americans in the area, and that continues with covert protection and support from the government while maintaining communications with a distant home location. Hall&#39;s powerful and entirely self-consistent narrative, filled with surprising and revealing detail, is so impressive that I have chosen it as the only example of modern human-ET contact to receive major coverage in my web pages. Gerry Zeitlin, Open Seti Initiative
&lt;br&gt;
It is possible that eventually the story Charles Hall tells will be seen as a pivotal moment in UFOlogy. His story has become the key to linking a disparate series of reports, encounters and claims that have circulated in UFO circles without a home for many years.This fourth and final account gives us the most detailed look ever into one aspect of a covert military-alien liaison that has been underway for decades.Essential reading!Researcher, Author." />
