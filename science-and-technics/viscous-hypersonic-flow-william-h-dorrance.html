  <title>Viscous Hypersonic Flow - William  H. Dorrance</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;This frequently cited text addresses theories for treating the laminar and turbulent boundary layers of reacting gas mixtures. The theories are developed from fundamentals, and all related chemical, thermodynamic, and physical concepts are described in a fashion that provides a self-contained treatment. In addition, the book presents useful equations for calculating heat transfer between reacting gas boundary layers and reacting, melting, sublimating, and otherwise decomposing surfaces. &lt;BR&gt;Designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate engineering courses in modern boundary-layer theory, this volume also serves as a valuable reference for professionals. Along with its thorough coverage of the theories for treating reacting laminar and turbulent boundary layers, the text also describes the underlying theories and methods of calculating transport and thermodynamic properties for dilute gas mixtures. Certain useful concepts from thermochemistry are also examined in detail. All theories are developed from the fundamentals, with a focus on the basic physics of interactions between like and unlike particles and the roles these interactions play in determining the transport properties of reacting gas mixtures.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
