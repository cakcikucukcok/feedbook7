      <meta name="description" content="Pests are an inevitable part of our existence. Without our knowledge we coexist with several kinds of pests may it be through our pets, our plants even in the security of our own homes. It also comes in different sizes and forms but as microscopic or minute, though visible to the human eye, they appear they create a vast nuisance to our daily lives. With nature’s law of cause and effect, humans, in defense to these pests, find ways to control it in the hopes of finally eradicating the pests’ existence. We want to get rid of those pests as fast as we can without taking in consideration what makes these products very powerful that it can do what it says it will do. In return, these pests can develop an adaptation mechanism that makes them immune to these commercial products. As a result, we buy another brand or use a different approach that may contain stronger chemical components." />
