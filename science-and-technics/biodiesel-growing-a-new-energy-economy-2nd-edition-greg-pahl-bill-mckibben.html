  <title>Biodiesel: Growing a New Energy Economy, 2nd Edition - Greg Pahl, Bill McKibben</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For anyone who is trying to keep up with the extremely rapid developments in the biodiesel industry, the second edition of &lt;em&gt;Biodiesel: Growing a New Energy Economy&lt;/em&gt; is an invaluable aid. The breathtaking speed with which biodiesel has gained acceptance in the marketplace in the past few years has been exceeded only by the proliferation of biodiesel production facilities around the United States--and the world--only to confront new social and environmental challenges and criticisms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The international survey of the biodiesel industry has been expanded from 40 to more than 80 countries, reflecting the spectacular growth of the industry around the world. This section also tracks the dramatic shifts in the fortunes of the industry that have taken place in some of these nations. The detailed chapters that cover the industry in the United States have also been substantially rewritten to keep abreast of its many new developments and explosive domestic growth.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An expanded section on small-scale, local biodiesel production has been added to better represent this small but growing part of the industry. Another new section has been added to more fully explore the increasingly controversial issues of deforestation and food versus fuel, as well as GMO crops. The second edition concludes with updated views on where the industry is headed in the years to come from some of its key players.&lt;/p&gt;" />
