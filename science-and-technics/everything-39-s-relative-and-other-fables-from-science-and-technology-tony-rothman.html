  <title>Everything&#39;s Relative: And Other Fables from Science and Technology - Tony Rothman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The surprising truth behind many of the most cherished &quot;facts&quot; in science history&lt;br&gt;Morse invented the telegraph, Bell the telephone, Edison the light bulb, and Marconi the radio . . . right? Well . . . the truth is slightly more complicated. The history of science and technology is riddled with apocrypha, inaccuracies, and falsehoods, and physicist Tony Rothman has taken it upon himself to throw a monkey wrench into the works. Combining a storyteller&#39;s gifts with a scientist&#39;s focus and hardheaded devotion to the facts-such as they may be-Rothman breaks down many of the most famous &quot;just-so&quot; stories of physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology, and technology to give credit where credit is truly due. From Einstein&#39;s possible misunderstanding of his own theories to actress Hedy Lemarr&#39;s role in the invention of the radio-controlled torpedo, he dredges his way through the legends of science history in relating the fascinating stories behind some of the most important, and often unsung, breakthroughs in science.&lt;br&gt;Tony Rothman, PhD (Bryn Mawr, PA), is a Research Associate at Bryn Mawr College. He is the author of seven other critically acclaimed science books and a frequent contributor to leading science publications, including Scientific American and Discover." />
