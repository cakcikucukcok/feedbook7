  <title>Birds and Bees, Sharp Eyes, and Other Papers - John Burroughs, Mary E. Burt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a collection of works by American naturalist John Burroughs. Included are: &quot;Birds &amp; Bees&quot;, &quot;Bird Enemies&quot;, &quot;The Tragedies of the Nests&quot;, &quot;Bees&quot;, &quot;An Idyl of the Honey-Bee&quot;, &quot;The Pastoral Bees&quot;, &quot;Sharp Eyes and Other Papers&quot;, &quot;Sharp Eyes, &quot;The Apple&quot;, &quot;A Taste of Maine Birch&quot;, &quot;Winter Neighbors&quot;, &quot;Notes by the Way&quot;, &quot;The Weather-wise Muskrat&quot;, &quot;Cheating the Squirrels&quot;, &quot;Fox and Hound&quot;, and many more. John Burroughs (1837 - 1921) was an American naturalist, essayist, and active member of the U.S. conservation movement. Burroughs&#39; work was incredibly popular during his lifetime, which manly argue is down to his unique perceptions of the natural world coupled with an impressive literary talent. Other notable works by this author include: &quot;Winter Sunshine&quot; (1875), &quot;Birds and Poets&quot; (1877), and &quot;Locusts and Wild Honey&quot; (1879). Since his death, his legacy has lived on in the form of twelve U.S. Schools named after him, Burroughs Mountain and the John Burroughs Association, which publicly recognizes well-written and illustrated natural history publications. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing &quot;Bird Neighbors&quot; now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />
