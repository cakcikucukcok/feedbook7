      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Dive into the history and application of the IBC&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Building Codes Illustrated: A Guide to the 2015 International Building Code, Fifth Edition&lt;/i&gt; is a bestselling complement to the International Building Code, or IBC. Designed to give you an insider&#39;s look at the origins of the IBC, how it can be interpreted, and how it applies to design and construction, this updated text offers new information regarding hazmat occupancies, hospitals, and nursing homes, major changes to how building heights and areas are presented, as well as means of egress, and the latest information on building materials, interior environments, and structural provisions. Francis D.K. Ching&#39;s distinctive illustrations and the code expertise of Steven Winkel, FAIA, give students and professionals in architecture, interior design, construction, and engineering industries a user-friendly, easy-to-use guide to fundamentally understanding the 2015 IBC. &lt;p&gt;Building codes and standards serve to establish minimum regulations that emphasize performance while prioritizing public health and safety. Updated every three years, the IBC is the most important reference that you can leverage throughout your career in architecture, design, or engineering. The IBC is a national &#39;model building code&#39; which is adopted in some form by most building permit jurisdictions across the nation and in several foreign countries. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Access the updated regulations reflected in the 2015 IBC&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Explore how the IBC was developed, and why it is an important component of so many industries&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Identify the areas of the IBC that have undergone the most change, such as the presentation of building heights and areas, along with changes to means of egress provisions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Easily navigate and digest the information with full illustrations&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Building Codes Illustrated: A Guide to the 2015 International Building Code, Fifth Edition&lt;/i&gt; is a practical, fully illustrated reference that guides you through the latest in building code regulations." />
