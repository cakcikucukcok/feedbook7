  <title>Let&#39;s Go See Mother Wilkerson&#39;s Farm - Marva N. Collins, Earnest Hooks Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Th is book is published in honor of Mrs. Lizzie Wilkerson, artist, who was born in 1900 in a rural
community of Newton County, Georgia, USA. She was the youngest of 21 children, although she
was childless. In 1919, she married Dewey Wilkerson a local friend, laborer/mechanic, and moved
to Atlanta.
In 1978, her brilliant and unique talent was discovered through a Georgia State University
community outreach program, headed by Jean Ellen Jones, Professor Emeritus of Art. Following
three successful, separate shows in the Atlanta metropolitan area, Mrs. Wilkersons artwork hangs in
the most prestigious museums of the United State. Animal Parade is in the permanent collection at
the Museum of American Folk Art, New York, New York; Covington Country Plantation hangs
in the National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institute, Washington, D.C. and Pink
Angel is in the permanent collection at Atlanta High Museum of Art. Mrs. Wilkerson died in
1984 at the age of 84, following a brief illness. During the last survey, owners of her art have refused
all requests from buyers regardless of the amounts." />
