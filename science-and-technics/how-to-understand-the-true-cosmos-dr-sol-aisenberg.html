  <title>How to Understand the True Cosmos - Dr. Sol Aisenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The need for dark matter and dark energy are  removed by the introduction of observations of galaxies and stars at cosmic distances to be added to the observations of planets in our solar system. When cosmic observations that were not available to Newton are included, the result is a new universal model of gravity also valid for the cosmos and also the solar system, without change. When applied to the existing cosmic observations and solar system observations, the resulting Universal Law of Cosmic Gravity by Aisenberg explains cosmic observations and reduces to Newtons law in the solar system.
Hubble observed that redshifts increased with distance but without proof suggested that the redshift and the Doppler effect showed that the galaxies were receding and that the universe was expanding. This led to the wrong belief in the big bang but without observational proof of receding velocity.
We will show that the age of the cosmos is wrong, explain tired light, solve Olbers paradox about the dark sky, and remove the need for inflation. We will explain the cosmic microwave background (CMB), explain quasars and black holes, and why the cosmos is apparently closed. The latest Nobel Prizes (1978 and 2011) for Physics should be reexamined.
	The author, Dr. Sol Aisenberg earned a PhD in Physics from MIT, with a minor in math, was a part time staff member in the MIT physics department and in the Research Lab of Electronics, RLE, and was a part-time lecturer at the Harvard Medical School and a part-time visiting research professor of bioengineering in Boston University. 
	Aisenberg was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi (science), and Pi Mu Epsilon (math) honor societies." />
