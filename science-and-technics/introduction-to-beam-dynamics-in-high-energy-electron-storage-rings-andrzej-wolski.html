  <title>Introduction to Beam Dynamics in High-Energy Electron Storage Rings - Andrzej Wolski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Electron storage rings play a crucial role in many areas of modern scientific research. In light sources, they provide intense beams of x-rays that can be used to understand the structure and behavior of materials at the atomic scale, with applications to medicine, the life sciences, condensed matter physics, engineering, and technology. In particle colliders, electron storage rings allow experiments that probe the laws of nature at the most fundamental level. Understanding and controlling the behavior of the beams of particles in storage rings is essential for the design, construction, and operation of light sources and colliders aimed at reaching increasingly demanding performance specifications. Introduction to Beam Dynamics in High-Energy Electron Storage Rings describes the physics of particle behavior in these machines. Starting with an outline of the history, uses, and structure of electron storage rings, the book develops the foundations of beam dynamics, covering particle motion in the components used to guide and focus the beams, the effects of synchrotron radiation, and the impact of interactions between the particles in the beams. The aim is to emphasize the physics behind key phenomena, keeping mathematical derivations to a minimum: numerous references are provided for those interested in learning more. The text includes discussion of issues relevant to machine design and operation and concludes with a brief discussion of some more advanced topics, relevant in some special situations, and a glimpse of current research aiming to develop the &quot;ultimate&quot; storage rings." />
