  <title>Mathematics in Civilization, Third Edition - Howard L. Resnikoff, Raymond O. Wells, Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Space flight, computers, lasers, and information technology &amp;#8213; these are but a few examples of the spectacular growth, development, and far-reaching applications of mathematics. But what of the field&#39;s past? Upon which intellectual milestones were the foundations of modern mathematics constructed? How has our comprehension of the physical universe, language, and the nature of thought itself been influenced and informed by the developments of mathematics through the ages?&lt;BR&gt;This lucid presentation examines how mathematics shaped and was shaped by the course of human events. In a format suited to college-level studies as well as popular reading, the book explores trigonometry, navigation, cartography, logarithms, algebra, and calculus through ancient, medieval, post-Renaissance, and modern times. Solutions to problems appear at the end of each chapter, and this edition has been newly expanded to include a supplement on events in mathematics since the 1985 publication of the first Dover edition. Acclaimed by &lt;I&gt;Telegraphic Reviews&lt;/I&gt; as &quot;an exceptionally good liberal arts math text,&quot; this highly readable treatment makes a technical subject vividly fascinating." />
