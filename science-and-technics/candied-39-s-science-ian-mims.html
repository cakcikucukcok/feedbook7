  <title>Candied&#39;s Science - Ian Mims</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On an estate in the north of Angeland lived the ex-football player Lord Fred of Morphalli. He dwelt in a modern castle with conspicuous round turrets that was a monument to his assets, for the stone edifice seemed to reflect an inverted pair of the tight-fitting stylish trousers for which his lordship was notably famous. There was no doubt that Lord Fred was particularly well endowed.
Also living in the castle was an orphan. Candied. together with Lord Freds daughter, Cutiegard, and their private tutor Dr Pang-loss The honourable teacher had a theme that we lived in the best possible of all worlds for we could exploit technology to change everything.
One day Cutiegard was walking through the woods around the castle when she saw Dr Pang-loss in the bushes apparently trying out some new techniques on a chambermaid. She explained what she had seen over the dinner table that night and was horrified to see her tutor get dismissed
Candied observed this whole disaster and in despair called out to his departing tutor. Oh wise one, how can I follow in your footsteps and improve the technology that you have practiced and to which I have dedicated my life?
There was a brief silence and then he heard Pang-loss voice as he disappeared down the path to the village. It was the advice that was to change his life.
