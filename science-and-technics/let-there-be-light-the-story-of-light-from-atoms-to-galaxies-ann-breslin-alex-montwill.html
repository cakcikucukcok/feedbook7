  <title>Let There Be Light: The Story of Light from Atoms to Galaxies - ANN BRESLIN, ALEX MONTWILL</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is the first of its kind devoted to the key role played by light and electromagnetic radiation in the universe.

Whenever possible, the mathematical material of the first edition has been replaced by appropriate text to give a verbal account of the mystery of the phenomenon of light and how its understanding has developed from pre-historic to present times.
