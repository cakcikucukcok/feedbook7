  <title>Why Genes Are Not Selfish and People Are Nice - Colin Tudge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The modern world is dominated by ideas that are threatening to kill us: that life is one long battle from conception to grave; that all creatures, including human beings, are driven by their selfish DNA; that the universe is just stuff, for us to use at will. These ideas are seen as emerging from science and hard-nosed philosophy, and become self-fulfilling. They have led us to create a world in perpetual strife,that is unjust and in many ways precarious. This remarkable book by an experienced author and thinker argues there&#39;s another way of looking at the world that is just as rooted in modern science, and yet says precisely the opposite: that life is in fact cooperative; all creatures, including human beings, are basically nice; that there&#39;s more to the &#39;stuff&#39; of the world than meets the eye. This book is both a powerful call to rethink our assumptions, and a message of hope for those who believe we&#39;re doomed to self-destruction.The modern world is dominated by ideas that are threatening to kill us: that life is one long battle from conception to grave; that all creatures, including human beings, are driven by their selfish DNA; that the universe is just stuff, for us to use at will.
