  <title>Fracture Gradient - Jim McCulloch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How would the world react to an alternative energy discovery with the potential of providing an unlimited supply of nearly free energy? Could the United States government be trusted to help develop the concept and responsibly control its introduction to the world?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fletcher Boyd and Hollis Cade learn some hard lessons when their naive expectations clash with the harsh reality of economic might, and threaten the international balance of power. Can a few ruggedly individualistic underdogs withstand a massive assault from highly-trained government operatives and international corporations hell-bent on controlling their discovery?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fracture Gradient is their exciting story of discovery, hope, greed, disappointment, danger, and deceit. It&amp;#39;s a vigorous, rousing, and sometimes brutal foray into economic gamesmanship where potential reward matches risk . . . and losers don&amp;#39;t live to tell.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Looking for a touchy-feely story that makes you warm and fuzzy? Fracture Gradient isn&amp;#39;t for you. This is a hard story about hard men who think for themselves, won&amp;#39;t back down, and don&amp;#39;t bend to the wishes of others. It&amp;#39;s about quick-learning, action-oriented men who take responsibility for their actions and are willing to die for principles . . . and each other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
