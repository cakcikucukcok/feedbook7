  <title>The Physics of Reality: Space, Time, Matter, Cosmos - Richard L Amoroso, Louis H Kauffman, Peter Rowlands</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A truly Galilean-class volume, this book introduces a new method in theory formation, completing the tools of epistemology. It covers a broad spectrum of theoretical and mathematical physics by researchers from over 20 nations from four continents. Like Vigier himself, the Vigier symposia are noted for addressing avant-garde, cutting-edge topics in contemporary physics. Among the six proceedings honoring J.-P. Vigier, this is perhaps the most exciting one as several important breakthroughs are introduced for the first time. The most interesting breakthrough in view of the recent NIST experimental violations of QED is a continuation of the pioneering work by Vigier on tight bound states in hydrogen. The new experimental protocol described not only promises empirical proof of large-scale extra dimensions in conjunction with avenues for testing string theory, but also implies the birth of the field of unified field mechanics, ushering in a new age of discovery. Work on quantum computing redefines the qubit in a manner that the uncertainty principle may be routinely violated. Other breakthroughs occur in the utility of quaternion algebra in extending our understanding of the nature of the fermionic singularity or point particle. There are several other discoveries of equal magnitude, making this volume a must-have acquisition for the library of any serious forward-looking researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contents:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foundational Physics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Special and General Relativity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thermodynamics, Fields, and Gravity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quantum Mechanics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cosmology and Consciousness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Readership:&lt;/b&gt; Students and professionals in physics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key Features:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prominent authors such as mathematician L H Kauffman and internationally renowned knot theorist Walter Schempp (the grandson of Kepler and an NMR pioneer)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For nearly 20 years, the Vigier symposium has been internationally and uniquely known for its unbridled foray into cutting-edge topics that physicists want to address. This is because it believes that advancement in science does not occur by &amp;#x2018;hugging the status quo&amp;#x2019;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This volume differs from the others especially in its unique treatment of historical dilemmas such as the nature of the singularity or point particle, the introduction of a relativistic qubit beyond the usual Bloch sphere model, and the studies of complex space and new cosmological models &amp;#x2014; to cite a few examples&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
