  <title>Chromosomes - Ronnee Yashon, Michael R. Cummings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is hard to avoid hearing about genetic testing. It is advertised, discussed, debated, and offered to patients. Some are over the counter, such as paternity testing, testing for risk for diabetes and others. Others are offered by private companies and still others by drug companies, These tests may or may not show a distinct answer, so it important for patients to understand these results. Early in 1920s a Eugenics movement began in the United States, courts decided which person had undesirable traits and would be sterilized so they could not pass these traits to their children. The idea here was to create a population with better genes (therefore healthier and richer). Families who were chosen received awards and people began to see the importance of genetics. But little did they know how it would EXPLODE! This book will look at genetic testing as it applies today and how the serious decisions that it demands, cannot be ignored." />
