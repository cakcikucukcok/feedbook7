  <title>The Trashman Is Rich - Javonte&#39; Jennings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about how to make a living in America by paying pennies on the dollar on everything you do. I grew-up in Baltimore, Maryland. When I lived in Baltimore, I didn&#39;t realize the opportunities that was there for me. If you are in the Baltimore area, then you may become the next millionaire this book teaches you to be. 
I was raised around drug dealers and people that always took advantage of other people. As I got older and saw the way to a better life, I realize that it was actually like that. I notice that that&#39;s the way of life. Most people don&#39;t want to admit it, but if you study life as I did, you will see that its all about, Haves and Have knots. I&#39;m a very young person with more experience in the things you will learn in this book then the average elder. 
When some people hear about awesome ways to make money, the first thing they thing of is that it must be some type on scam or something. Well, the secrets you will learn and apply in this book will give you a better over look of life and who to REALLY look out for. No matter of how a person talk, look, act, respond to certain things. Always remember, that everyone in this planted is out to make money in some type of way. That&#39;s just the way of the world. Some people may not take it as serious as others, but you will notice them people by how they live." />
