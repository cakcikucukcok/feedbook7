  <title>Object Teleportation &gt; T &gt; - Vijay Jain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is a well-known fact that Vijay Jain is an underqualified academic scientist but is very successful in journalism, and international fame came especially from a laptop he bought recently. 
He was weak in almost all elective subjects, which was one reason he failed in higher secondary, but somehow, Fr. P. Zoris saw something extraordinary in him and gave him a chance in commerce. But this time, something really dangerous happened, since he was poisoned by his eldest brothers wife. Somehow he was saved from the brink of death, but temporary insanity took his self-prestige in his own eyes completely, and the changed life begun. 
Thrashing journalism in newspaper, telegraphs, business, romance, and singing couplets with writing in Urdu mixed with Hindi, besides Bengali and English. But many of it remains with love, tragedy, and a career torn with thorns and a series of frauds inside the family by his brother and sister-in-law, and the past poisoning case made him depressed and volatile in anger time to time. 
It is said that due to a psychological problem, something really good happened, and intellectual side bounced up to extraordinary genius. But his depression or sadness never left because of the prestige conscious sensitivity. 
The specific goal in science and singing is going to be his only friend in the last side of life because once again, a deadly shock shattered him due to the criminal burning of his lady love, which led to her death. Once again, his extremely religious mother intervened and didnt want to go for revenge. 
A great soul he might be, he is a human with worthless, wounded soul and a crushed heart, with his mind swimming in between. Hence, these are the best candidates for drama, discovery, or invention, and sometimes all." />
