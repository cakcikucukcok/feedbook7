  <title>What Do You Do All Day? - Amy Scheibe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Amy Scheibe&#39;s debut novel is a fresh, funny, witty take on the magic manic days of young motherhood. Her Jennifer Bradley is a thoroughly modern mommy--a former club kid who is married to the man of her dreams and who quit a fabulous job as an antiquarian objects dealer to raise her two children: Georgia, a very advanced age 4, and baby Max.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it&#39;s alarmingly easy to spin a stay-at-home mommy&#39;s world on its axis--and Jennifer&#39;s is whirling. If it&#39;s not her mother-in-law on her tail to expose her precious grandchildren to a better element (not to mention pointing out that dangerous concrete floor in their loft), it&#39;s her husband Thom announcing he&#39;ll be on the road to Singapore for the next who-knows how long. And is this really the right time for her dad to announce that her mother isn&#39;t exactly who Jennifer thinks she is? Or for the ex-boyfriend--aka the Adult Child Actor--to come back on the scene? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An American answer to Alison Pearson&#39;s &lt;i&gt;I Don&#39;t Know How She Does It&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;What Do You Do All Day?&lt;/i&gt; is a sparkling, lovable novel for mommies of all kinds--whether in the trenches or out on the hustings.&lt;/p&gt;" />
