  <title>More than a Fling? (Mills &amp; Boon Modern Tempted) - Joss Wood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;‘I will consider doing the&lt;br /&gt;campaign – seriously consider&lt;br /&gt;it – if you sleep with me.’&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Ross Bennett has the not-so-enjoyable pleasure of hearing those words come out of his mouth, he realises he must have left his pants in charge. Because the woman sitting opposite him might be seriously gorgeous, but this is serious business – not some sleazy backroom deal! Until Ally floors him by agreeing to his terms…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ally Jones might find Ross utterly irresistible, but that can wait: she has a thing or two to teach him first! Her first lesson? Everything comes to those who wait…&lt;/p&gt;
