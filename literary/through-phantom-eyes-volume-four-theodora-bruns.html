  <title>Through Phantom Eyes: Volume Four - Theodora Bruns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Another masterful tale. A riveting account of Eriks ongoing trials, tribulations and triumphs. Fascinating, suspenseful, and often heart-wrenching. Bruns brings Erik to life. Rich food for the emotions, mind and soul.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Susan Rueppel, Ph.D., Chief Intuition Officer, Energetic Wisdom&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After barely escaping Persia with his life, Erik decides to participate in the construction of the famed Paris Opera House, intending to make a secret home for himself in its cellars. That process takes 13 years to complete, during which time he struggles to survive not only the cruelty of the other workers but also the brutality of the Franco-Prussian War and the tragic attempted takeover by the Communes. Having successfully overcome those challenges, he desires nothing more than a comfortable life filled with music. But, in order for that to happen, he must make the operas managers do his bidding. To persuade them that he is the one in control of his opera house, many performances suffer under his clever and sometimes diabolical humor. Then, just when he thinks his life is as good as it can get, the unexpected occurshe encounters the young chorus girl Christine, and, against all good judgment, his lonely heart dares to reach out to her. His life will never be the same again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
