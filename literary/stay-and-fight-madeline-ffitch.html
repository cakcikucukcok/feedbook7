  <title>Stay and Fight - Madeline ffitch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Like &lt;i&gt;Bastard Out of Carolina&lt;/i&gt;, ffitch&#39;s electrifying debut novel is &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;a paean to independence and a protest against the materialism of our age.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;O: The Oprah Magazine &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Delightfully raucous.&quot; --Sam Sacks, &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Helen arrives in Appalachian Ohio full of love and her boyfriend&#39;s ideas for living off the land. Too soon, with winter coming, he calls it quits. Helped by Rudy--her government-questioning, wisdom-spouting, seasonal-affective-disordered boss--and a neighbor couple, Helen makes it to spring. Those neighbors, Karen and Lily, are awaiting the arrival of their first child, a boy, which means their time at the Women&#39;s Land Trust must end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So Helen invites the new family to throw in with her--they&#39;ll split the work and the food, build a house, and make a life that sustains them, if barely, for years. Then young Perley decides he wants to go to school. And Rudy sets up a fruit-tree nursery on the pipeline easement edging their land. The outside world is brought clamoring into their makeshift family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in a region known for its independent spirit, &lt;i&gt;Stay and Fight&lt;/i&gt; shakes up what it means to be a family, to live well, to make peace with nature and make deals with the system. It is a protest novel that challenges our notions of effective action. It is a family novel that refuses to limit the term. And it is a marvel of storytelling that both breaks with tradition and celebrates it. Best of all, it is full of flawed, cantankerous, flesh-and-blood characters who remind us that conflict isn&#39;t the end of love, but the real beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Absorbingly spun, perfectly voiced, and disruptively political, Madeline ffitch&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Stay and Fight&lt;/i&gt; forces us to reimagine an Appalachia--and an America--we think we know. And it takes us, laughing and fighting, into a new understanding of what it means to love and to be free.&lt;/p&gt;" />
