  <title>Accidents - Yael Hedaya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A captivating first novel of family, sex, love, and death from an &quot;extraordinary&quot; writer of &quot;remarkable emotional power&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;      (Maureen Howard, &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Shira Klein, Yonatan Luria, and his daughter, Dana, it is winter-winter at work, winter among friends, winter at home, and winter of the heart. Yonatan is a marginal writer, a fifty-year-old widower left to raise his child alone. When he meets Shira, a bestselling author paralyzed by stage fright, the thaw begins as man, woman, and girl enter a halting romance, alternately tender and belligerent, generous and withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the accompaniment of a full chorus of voices-of friends, neighbors, ex-lovers, parents-speaking from the past as well as the present, this family in the making gropes its way toward the comfort of love while navigating through ordinary pains: a dying father, angry children, wounding moments, and a distressing difference in the writers&#39; levels of success which they wish would vanish even as it grows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ensemble story marked by Yael Hedaya&#39;s exquisite sensitivity, &lt;i&gt;Accidents&lt;/i&gt; follows its cast through fragility, vulnerability, and joy, accruing the small events of unremarkable days to produce a grand vision of the shared life. Rarely has the fictional world of family been plumbed with such knowingness, humor, and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
