  <title>The Shepherd&#39;s Hut - Tim Winton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Tim Winton, Australia&#39;s most decorated and beloved novelist and the author of &lt;i&gt;Cloudstreet&lt;/i&gt;, comes &lt;i&gt;The Shepherd&#39;s Hut&lt;/i&gt;, the story of a young man on a thrilling journey of self-discovery in one of the harshest, near-uninhabitable climates on Earth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Tim Winton is Australia&#39;s most decorated and beloved novelist. Short-listed twice for the Booker Prize and the winner of a record four Miles Franklin Literary Awards for Best Australian Novel, he has a gift for language virtually unrivaled among writers in English. His work is both tough and tender, primordial and new--always revealing the raw, instinctual drives that lure us together and rend us apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Shepherd&#39;s Hut&lt;/i&gt;, Winton crafts the story of Jaxie Clackton, a brutalized rural youth who flees from the scene of his father&#39;s violent death and strikes out for the vast wilds of Western Australia. All he carries with him is a rifle and a waterjug. All he wants is peace and freedom. But surviving in the harsh saltlands alone is a savage business. And once he discovers he&#39;s not alone out there, all Jaxie&#39;s plans go awry. He meets a fellow exile, the ruined priest Fintan MacGillis, a man he&#39;s never certain he can trust, but on whom his life will soon depend. &lt;i&gt;The Shepherd&#39;s Hut&lt;/i&gt; is a thrilling tale of unlikely friendship and yearning, at once brutal and lyrical, from one of our finest storytellers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
