          &lt;strong&gt;Special Agent Jesse Colton had a strong instinct to say no to sweet, vulnerable Samantha Cosgrove.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not because he doubted her shocking claim - that her boss was sharing government secrets - but because the innocently seductive blond beauty made him want to say yes…to anything her heart desired. He was one of the Agency&#39;s finest. But Samantha wished someone had warned her that Jesse Colton was tall, dark and handsome.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now he was posing as her boyfriend to protect her from a dangerous web of deceit - but his own &quot;pretend&quot; kisses made her traitorous body wish he&#39;d perform more husbandly duties….&lt;/p&gt;
