  <title>The Rancher Wore Suits (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) - Rita Herron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Dr. Dex Montgomery was all business. And Ty Cooper had to remember that, if he wanted people to believe he was his identical twin brother. But when the rugged rancher met sophisticated Dr. Jessica Stovall, mixing business and pleasure seemed like the perfect plan! Unfortunately he wasn&#39;t the man she thought he was….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jessica usually needed a blowtorch to blast through Dex&#39;s icy demeanor. But when his sexy gaze and charming smile suddenly focused on Jessica, she was the one feeling hot and bothered. Getting involved with the sinfully handsome and wealthy doctor would be all wrong–but why did it feel so right? And why did Dex act as if he had something to hide…?&lt;/p&gt;
