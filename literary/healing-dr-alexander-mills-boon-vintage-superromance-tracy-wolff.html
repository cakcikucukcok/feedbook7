  <title>Healing Dr. Alexander (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) - Tracy Wolff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;This was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; his professional plan. Dr. Jack Alexander–dedicated surgeon and humanitarian–never expected an accident would end his time in the O.R. Nor did he expect to have to abandon his aid work. Now, back in Atlanta, he&#39;s faced with rebuilding his career…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;his life. And his hope for the future comes from the least likely source–the little family next door.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From the first moment he spots Sophie Connors having a water fight with her young sons, Jack is captivated. She defies all of his assumptions about family and relationships. Too bad she resists committing. Somehow he has to change her mind. Because together they may find that life doesn&#39;t always turn out the way you planned…sometimes, it turns out even better.&lt;/p&gt;
