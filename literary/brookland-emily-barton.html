Now, established as the owner of the enormously successful gin distillery she inherited from her father, she can begin to realize her dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set in eighteenth-century Brooklyn, this is the story of a determined and intelligent woman who is consumed by a vision of a bridge: a gargantuan construction of timber and masonry she devises to cross the East River in a single, magnificent span. With the help of the local surveyor, Benjamin Horsfield, and her sisters--the high-spirited, obstreperous Tem, who works with her in the distillery, and the silent, uncanny Pearl--she fires the imaginations of the people of Brooklyn and New York by promising them a bridge that will meet their most pressing practical needs while being one of the most ambitious public works ever attempted. Prue&#39;s own life and the life of the bridge become inextricably bound together as the costs of the bridge, both financial and human, rise beyond her direst expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Brookland&lt;/i&gt; confirms Emily Barton&#39;s reputation as one of the finest writers of her generation, whose work is &quot;blessedly post-ironic, engaging and heartfelt&quot; (Thomas Pynchon).&lt;/p&gt;" />
