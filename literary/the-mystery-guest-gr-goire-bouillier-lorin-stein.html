  <title>The Mystery Guest - Grégoire Bouillier, Lorin Stein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When the phone rang on a gloomy fall afternoon in 1990, Grégoire Bouillier had no way of knowing that it was the woman who&#39;d left him, without warning, ten years before. And he couldn&#39;t have guessed why she was calling--not to apologize for, or explain, the way she&#39;d vanished from his life, but to invite him to a party. A birthday party. For a woman he&#39;d never met. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the story of how one man got over a broken heart, learned to love again, stopped wearing turtlenecks, regained his faith in literature, participated in a work of performance art by mistake, and spent his rent money on a bottle of 1964 bordeaux that nobody ever drank. &lt;i&gt;The Mystery Guest &lt;/i&gt;is, in the words of &lt;i&gt;L&#39;Humanité&lt;/i&gt;, a work of &quot;fiendish wit and refinement.&quot; It pushes the conventions of autobiography (and those great themes of French literature: love and aging) to an absurd, poignant, and very funny conclusion. This translation marks the English-language debut of an iconoclast who has attracted one of the most passionate cult followings in French literature today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
