  <title>The Choices We Make - Karma Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Following her bestselling debut novel &lt;em&gt;Come Away with Me&lt;/em&gt;, Karma Brown returns with an unforgettable story that explores the intricate dynamics of friendship and parenthood.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hannah and Kate became friends in the fifth grade, when Hannah hit a boy for looking up Kate&#39;s skirt with a mirror. While they&#39;ve been close as sisters ever since, Hannah can&#39;t help but feel envious of the little family Kate and her husband, David, have created—complete with two perfect little girls.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She and Ben have been trying for years to have a baby, so when they receive the news that she will likely never get pregnant, Hannah&#39;s heartbreak is overwhelming. But just as they begin to tentatively explore the other options, it&#39;s Kate&#39;s turn to do the rescuing. Not only does she offer to be Hannah&#39;s surrogate, but Kate is willing to use her own eggs to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Full of renewed hope, excitement and gratitude, these two families embark on an incredible journey toward parenthood…until a devastating tragedy puts everything these women have worked toward at risk of falling apart. Poignant and refreshingly honest, &lt;em&gt;The Choices We Make&lt;/em&gt; is a powerful tale of an incredible friendship and the risks we take to make our dreams come true.&lt;/p&gt;
