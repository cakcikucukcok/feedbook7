  <title>The Almost Sisters - Joshilyn Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With empathy, grace, humor, and piercing insight, the author of &lt;em&gt;gods in Alabama&lt;/em&gt; pens a powerful, emotionally resonant novel of the South that confronts the truth about privilege, family, and the distinctions between perception and reality---the stories we tell ourselves about our origins and who we really are.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superheroes have always been Leia Birch Briggs&amp;#8217; weakness. One tequila-soaked night at a comics convention, the usually level-headed graphic novelist is swept off her barstool by a handsome and anonymous Batman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out the caped crusader has left her with more than just a nice, fuzzy memory. She&amp;#8217;s having a baby boy&amp;#8212;an unexpected but not unhappy development in the thirty-eight year-old&amp;#8217;s life. But before Leia can break the news of her impending single-motherhood (including the fact that her baby is biracial) to her conventional, Southern family, her step-sister Rachel&amp;#8217;s marriage implodes. Worse, she learns her beloved ninety-year-old grandmother, Birchie, is losing her mind, and she&amp;#8217;s been hiding her dementia with the help of Wattie, her best friend since girlhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leia returns to Alabama to put her grandmother&amp;#8217;s affairs in order, clean out the big Victorian that has been in the Birch family for generations, and tell her family that she&amp;#8217;s pregnant. Yet just when Leia thinks she&amp;#8217;s got it all under control, she learns that illness is not the only thing Birchie&amp;#8217;s been hiding. Tucked in the attic is a dangerous secret with roots that reach all the way back to the Civil War. Its exposure threatens the family&amp;#8217;s freedom and future, and it will change everything about how Leia sees herself and her sister, her son and his missing father, and the world she thinks she knows.&lt;/p&gt;" />
