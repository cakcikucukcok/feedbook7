      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Librarian Molly Brewster had successfully created a new identity for herself until Deputy Sheriff Holt Tanner started asking questions about her past. Molly couldn&#39;t help but look to the ground when he watched her with his soulful brown eyes and waited for her to answer. In Holt, she sensed a need as deep as her own–to be loved completely…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;and without fear.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Holt had a case to solve and faced a beguiling librarian with secrets. He wanted to ease the pain that kept Molly from confiding in him, but he didn&#39;t quite trust her…or himself. Would his search for the truth force Molly into hiding, or would his love set her free and make her his?&lt;/p&gt;
