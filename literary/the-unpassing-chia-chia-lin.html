      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finalist for the 2019 NBCC John Leonard Prize for Best First Book. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shortlisted for the Center for Fiction&#39;s First Novel Prize. One of &lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s 10 Best Debut Novels of 2019. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Named one of the Best Books of 2019 by &lt;i&gt;TIME&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Esquire. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt; Editors&#39; Choice.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A singularly vast and captivating novel . . . What makes Lin&#39;s novel such an important book is the extent to which it probes America&#39;s mythmaking about itself.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A searing debut novel that explores community, identity, and the myth of the American dream through an immigrant family in Alaska&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Chia-Chia Lin&#39;s debut novel, &lt;i&gt;The Unpassing&lt;/i&gt;, we meet a Taiwanese immigrant family of six struggling to make ends meet on the outskirts of Anchorage, Alaska. The father, hardworking but beaten down, is employed as a plumber and repairman, while the mother, a loving, strong-willed, and unpredictably emotional matriarch, holds the house together. When ten-year-old Gavin contracts meningitis at school, he falls into a deep, nearly fatal coma. He wakes up a week later to learn that his little sister Ruby was infected, too. She did not survive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Routine takes over for the grieving family: the siblings care for each other as they befriend a neighboring family and explore the woods; distance grows between the parents as they deal with their loss separately. But things spiral when the father, increasingly guilt ridden after Ruby&#39;s death, is sued for not properly installing a septic tank, which results in grave harm to a little boy. In the ensuing chaos, what really happened to Ruby finally emerges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With flowing prose that evokes the terrifying beauty of the Alaskan wilderness, Lin explores the fallout after the loss of a child and the way in which a family is forced to grieve in a place that doesn&#39;t yet feel like home. Emotionally raw and subtly suspenseful, &lt;i&gt;The Unpassing&lt;/i&gt; is a deeply felt family saga that dismisses the American dream for a harsher, but ultimately more profound, reality.&lt;/p&gt;" />
