As the natural law arbitrator for Universe Delta III, it is his responsibility to protect intelligent life-forms from disasters. Papoo should be satisfied with his perfect life. Instead, his craving for adventure prompts him to request a life event assignment to an earth-like planet through his supervisor, the archangel Gabriel. Although Gabriel warns he may lose his memory of his existence and other dimensions, Papoo dreams of surviving the journey and returning home with an understanding of the Creator. But Lucifer knows of Papoo, and dark forces await.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Papoo begins his adventure with his spiritual counterparts, it shapes not only his destiny, but also that of a manChristopher Daniel Bird. Papoo remains focused on his mission to further the Creators purpose. But his assignment will not be as easy as he imagines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this illuminating tale that shares an unforgettable glimpse into the great beyond, a being embarks on a forty-year pilgrimage through three dimensions where he discovers the richness of his spiritual nature and the secret to what makes life spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;" />
