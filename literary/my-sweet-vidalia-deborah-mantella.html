  <title>My Sweet Vidalia - Deborah Mantella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On July 4, 1955, in rural Georgia, an act of violence threatens the life of Vidalia Lee Kandal Jackson&#39;s pre-born daughter. Despite the direst of circumstances, the spirit of the lost child refuses to leave her ill-equipped young mother&#39;s side.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For as long as she is needed-through troubled pregnancies, through poverty, through spousal abuse and agonizing betrayals-Cieli Mae, the determined spirit child, narrates their journey. Serving as a safe place and sounding board for Vidalia&#39;s innermost thoughts and confusions, lending a strength to her momma&#39;s emerging voice, Cieli Mae provides her own special brand of comfort and encouragement, all the while honoring the restrictions imposed by her otherworldly status.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vidalia finds further support in such unlikely townsfolk and relations as Doc Feldman, Gamma Gert and her Wild Women of God, and, most particularly, in Ruby Pearl Banks, the kind, courageous church lady, who has suffered her own share of heartache in their small Southern town of yesteryear&#39;s prejudices and presumptions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Sweet Vidalia&lt;/i&gt; is wise and witty, outstanding for its use of vibrant, poetic language and understated Southern dialect, as well as Mantella&#39;s clear-eyed observations of race relations as human relations, a cast of unforgettable characters, an in-depth exploration of the ties that bind, and its creative perspective. My Sweet Vidalia is a rare, wonderful, and complex look at hope, strength, the unparalleled power of unconditional love, and a young mother&#39;s refusal to give up. &lt;/p&gt;" />
