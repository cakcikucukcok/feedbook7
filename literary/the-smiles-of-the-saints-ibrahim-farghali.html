  <title>The Smiles of the Saints - Ibrahim Farghali</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I have returned to settle my account. . . .&quot; Told through the voices of a group of close friends and spanning a generation, &lt;em&gt;The Smiles of the Saints&lt;/em&gt; is an epic story condensed into a short, intricate novel. Twenty-year-old Haneen has just returned to Egypt after an absence of fifteen years spent mostly in a Parisian boarding school, cut off from all family save for sporadic visits from her father, Rami. She has been summoned back by her father&#39;s twin sister, who gives her an envelope containing his diaries, the last section of which is missing. Reading Rami&#39;s account of the passionate love affairs and tortured spiritual adventures of his youth, Haneen begins to unravel the riddle of a family she has barely known. Herself the child of a Muslim-Christian marriage, Haneen, in love with a Jewish man, is considering adding a further religious dimension to her family. But someone is carefully watching the proceedings, a figure from the past. Who exactly is this, and what stake does he have in Haneen&#39;s return? Couched in a pervasive air of mystery, Ibrahim Farghali&#39;s novel is resonant with observations on the intricacies of human entanglements." />
