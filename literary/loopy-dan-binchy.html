  <title>Loopy - Dan Binchy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dan Binchy&#39;s first two novels were delightful stories of small town Ireland and filled with a range of eccentric and hilarious characters.  Both books received warm praise--&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; called &lt;i&gt;The Neon Madonna&lt;/i&gt; &quot;terrifically funny and a hilarious read.&quot; &lt;i&gt; Booklist&lt;/i&gt; called &lt;i&gt;The Last Resort&lt;/i&gt; &quot;an endearing and entertaining combination of warmth and wit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tiny village of Trabane is tucked far away in the west of Ireland. A coastal resort on the Atlantic Ocean, the rugged strip of land that separates it from the beach boasts a golf course designed more by nature than by man. On &#39;links&#39; like this golf is much more than just a game to those that play it. It is a battlefield where scores are settled and every man and woman is equal. Anything further from the wealth and luxury of an exclusive country club would be hard to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet to young Larry Lynch, nicknamed LOOPY, golf opens up new horizons and the chance of a better life. The story of Loopy about much more than golf, it is the  struggle of good versus  evil, played out against a majestic backdrop of towering sand dunes, emerald green fairways and Atlantic hailstorms that prick the face like steel knitting needles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loopy is pitted against snobbery, big business and ruthless financiers in a golf match that is a parable of life itself. Helped only by an eccentric caddy and a gaggle of noisy supporters, he takes on some of the world&#39;s best amateur golfers in a titanic struggle that will warm the heart of readers everywhere. Little does he know that he is playing for a prize far, far greater than a silver trophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through it all, Binchy imbues the work with a wonderful feel of small town Ireland and, of course, the Irish spirit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
