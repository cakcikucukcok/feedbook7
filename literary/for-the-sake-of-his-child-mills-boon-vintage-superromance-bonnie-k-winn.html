  <title>For The Sake Of His Child (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) - Bonnie K. Winn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;After tragedy deprives her of the two people she loves most, Brynn Alder decides to leave her old life behind and start over in Texas Hill Country. Here she&#39;ll help troubled kids get their lives in order–it&#39;s the only way she can make sense of everything that&#39;s happened to her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But she knows that she&#39;ll be able to help only if she doesn&#39;t get emotionally involved. Of course, that&#39;s before she meets Jake McKenzie and his daughter, Andrea.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jake wants to be a good father, but he needs Brynn&#39;s help. And when circumstances force him to stay at the isolated ranch with Brynn and Andrea, emotions build and refuse to be denied.&lt;/p&gt;
