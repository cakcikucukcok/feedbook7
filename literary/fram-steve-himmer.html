  <title>Fram - Steve Himmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fram&lt;/i&gt; is the story of Oscar, a minor bureaucrat in the US government&#39;s Bureau of Ice Prognostication, an agency created to compete with the Soviets during the heyday of the Cold War and still operating in the present without the public&#39;s knowledge. Oscar and his partner Alexi are tasked with inventing discoveries and settlements in the Arctic, then creating the paperwork and digital records to &quot;prove&quot; their existence, preventing the inconvenience and expense of actual exploration. The job is the closest Oscar has come to his boyhood dream of being a polar explorer, until he and Alexi are sent on a secret mission to the actual Arctic, which brings them into a mysterious tangle of rival agencies and espionage that grows more dangerous the farther north they travel. The trip also allows Oscar to reconnect with his wife, Julia, from whom he&#39;s grown alienated by years of lying about what he does for a living (a distance compounded by Julia&#39;s own secret government job), leading both of them to discover what can be lost if we let one part of ourselves&amp;#8212;or one part of a story&amp;#8212;distract us from everything else the world offers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steve Himmer&lt;/b&gt; is the author of the novel &lt;i&gt;The Bee-Loud Glade&lt;/i&gt; (2011) and editor of the web journal &lt;i&gt;Necessary Fiction&lt;/i&gt;.
