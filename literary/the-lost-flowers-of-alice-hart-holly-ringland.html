      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner, ABIA General Fiction Book of the Year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An enchanting and captivating novel about how our untold stories haunt us &amp;#8212; and the stories we tell ourselves in order to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her family suffers a tragedy, nine-year-old Alice Hart is forced to leave her idyllic seaside home. She is taken in by her grandmother, June, a flower farmer who raises Alice on the language of Australian native flowers, a way to say the things that are too hard to speak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the watchful eye of June and the women who run the farm, Alice settles, but grows up increasingly frustrated by how little she knows of her family&amp;#8217;s story. In her early twenties, Alice&amp;#8217;s life is thrown into upheaval again when she suffers devastating betrayal and loss. Desperate to outrun grief, Alice flees to the dramatically beautiful central Australian desert. In this otherworldly landscape Alice thinks she has found solace, until she meets a charismatic and ultimately dangerous man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spanning two decades, set between sugar cane fields by the sea, a native Australian flower farm, and a celestial crater in the central desert, &lt;em&gt;The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart&lt;/em&gt; follows Alice&amp;#8217;s unforgettable journey, as she learns that the most powerful story she will ever possess is her own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
