          &lt;strong&gt;Single and pregnant ; she&#39;s about to be rescued!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rescue medic Angus Campbell never fails to meet difficult situations head on. But bonding with his new-found son needs more than professional training ; it needs his heart and his time. His childhood home, Lyrebird Lake, is the best place to find both of those things. . .&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pregnant midwife Mia is expecting a new arrival ; but not this six-foot sex god and his son! Mia does her best not to get involved, but Angus can&#39;t stop thinking that, with Mia as his wife, his son and her baby would have the perfect family.&lt;/p&gt;
