  <title>Be My Knife - David Grossman, Vered Almog, Maya Gurantz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The international bestseller: a compelling love story from the leading Israeli novelist of his generation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;We could be like two people who inject themselves with truth serum, and at long last have to tell it--the truth.  I want to be able to say to myself, &#39;I bled truth with her,&#39; yes, that&#39;s what I want.  Be a knife for me, and I, I swear, will be a knife for you.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An awkward, neurotic seller of rare books writes a desperate letter to a beautiful stranger whom he sees at a class reunion.  This simple, lonely attempt at seduction begins a love affair of words between Yair and Miriam, two married, middle-aged adults, dissatisfied with their lives, yearning for the connection that has always eluded them--and, eventually, reawakened to feelings that they thought had passed them by.  Their correspondence unfolds into an exchange of their most naked confessions: of desire, childhood tragedies, joys, and humiliations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the dialogue between Yair--a family man and surprisingly successful adulterer, whose complex, guarded letters reveal a life of secrets kept from the people closest to him--and Miriam, at first deceptively open and warm, who fills her life with distraction to avoid a past full of painful secrets, &lt;i&gt;Be My Knife&lt;/i&gt; explores the nature and the limits of intimacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deep departure from David Grossman&#39;s previous work, &lt;i&gt;Be My Knife&lt;/i&gt; is his subtlest, most passionate novel yet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
