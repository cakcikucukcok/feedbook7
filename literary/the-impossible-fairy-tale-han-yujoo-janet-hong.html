  <title>The Impossible Fairy Tale - Han Yujoo, Janet Hong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A chilling, wildly original novel from a major new voice from South Korea&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Impossible Fairy Tale &lt;/i&gt;is the story of two unexceptional  grade-school girls. Mia is &quot;lucky&quot;--she is spoiled by her mother and, as  she explains, her two fathers. She gloats over her exotic imported color  pencils and won&#39;t be denied a coveted sweater. Then there is the Child  who, by contrast, is neither lucky nor unlucky. She makes so little  impression that she seems not even to merit a name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At school,  their fellow students, whether lucky or luckless or unlucky, seem  consumed by an almost murderous rage. Adults are nearly invisible, and  the society the children create on their own is marked by cruelty and  soul-crushing hierarchies. Then, one day, the Child sneaks into the  classroom after hours and adds ominous sentences to her classmates&#39;  notebooks. This sinister but initially inconsequential act unlocks a  series of events that end in horrible violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that is not  the end of this eerie, unpredictable novel. A teacher, who is also this  book&#39;s author, wakes from an intense dream. When she arrives at her next  class, she recognizes a student: the Child, who knows about the events  of the novel&#39;s first half, which took place years earlier. Han Yujoo&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Impossible Fairy Tale &lt;/i&gt;is a fresh and terrifying exploration of the ethics of art making and of the stinging consequences of neglect.&lt;/p&gt;" />
