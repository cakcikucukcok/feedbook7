          &lt;strong&gt;Be swept away by passion… with intense drama and compelling plots, these emotionally powerful reads will keep you captivated from beginning to end.&lt;/strong&gt;

          &lt;strong&gt;Captured by the Billionaire &lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Maureen Child&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Billionaire Gabriel Vaughn had all but forgotten the past…until Debbie Harris arrived at his luxury resort. She’d walked away from him once, but now he wasn’t letting her leave his island without exacting his own brand of revenge – the ultimate seduction.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Sold into Marriage &lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Ann Major &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Christmas Eve. Paris. Two strangers’ eyes meet. So romantic. Yet Josie didn’t know her encounter with Adam Ryder was far from accidental. She could not regret the passionate evening she and Adam had shared – until she learned who he was. What was she to do now that she was pregnant?&lt;/p&gt;
