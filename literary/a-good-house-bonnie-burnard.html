  <title>A Good House - Bonnie Burnard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A runaway #1 bestseller in Canada, this richly layered first novel tells the story of the intricacies and rituals that shape a family&#39;s life over three generations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Good House &lt;/i&gt;begins in 1949 in Stonebrook, Ontario, home to the Chambers family. The postwar boom and hope for the future colors every facet of life: possibilities seem limitless for Bill, his wife, Sylvia, and their three children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fifty years that follow, the possibilities narrow into lives, etched by character, fate, and circumstance. Sylvia&#39;s untimely death marks her family indelibly but in ways only time will reveal. Paul&#39;s perfect marriage yields an imperfect child. Daphne unabashedly follows an unconventional path, while Patrick discovers that his happiness requires a series of compromises. Bill confronts the onset of old age less gracefully than anticipated, and throughout, his second wife, Margaret, remains, surprisingly, the family anchor.&lt;br&gt;With her remarkable ability to probe the hidden, often disturbing landscapes of love and to illuminate the complexities of human experience, Bonnie Burnard brings to her deceptively simple narrative a clarity that is both moving and profound.&lt;/p&gt;" />
