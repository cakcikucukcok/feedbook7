  <title>Scale - Keith Buckley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Ray Goldman will outdrink you, out-party you and, unfortunately for him, probably outlive you. As a hopeless and struggling indie rock musician, Ray&#39;s best chance of discovering any beauty and purpose in his dysfunctional life will come only when he ceases to struggle against life itself. These are his memoirs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Scale&lt;/I&gt; chronicles Ray Goldman&amp;#8217;s journey downward through the adversarial trials that sometimes prove necessary in facilitating an eventual ascent into truth and happiness. The odd chapters of the novel find Ray, now a 31-year-old guitar player, seeking fulfillment in the wake of a life-altering tragedy while the even chapters see him reflecting on the depravity and selfishness that hastened his descent towards it. &lt;I&gt;Scale&lt;/I&gt; is about the relationship between instability and balance, death and resurrection, perception and reality, but ultimately it is about the endless war waged between our disquieted minds and our noble hearts.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fans of pop culture, Americana, Punk Rock music, and Charles Bukowski&amp;#8217;s &lt;I&gt;Ham on Rye&lt;/I&gt; . . . look out!&lt;/div&gt;" />
