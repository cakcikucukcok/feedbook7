But while Lyle is thrilled to have his whole family reunited, he&amp;#8217;s also uneasy: in Shiloh&amp;#8217;s absence, she has become deeply involved with an extremist church, and the devout pastor courting her is convinced Isaac has the spiritual ability to heal the sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While reckoning with his own faith&amp;#8212;or lack thereof&amp;#8212;Lyle soon finds himself torn between his unease about the church and his desire to keep his daughter and grandson in his life.
