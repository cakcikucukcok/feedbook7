  <title>Blood and Circumstance - Frank Turner Hollon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A psychological mystery. Joel Stabler kills his beloved brother Danny in what appears to be murder in the name of mercy. When Joel&#39;s lawyers assign a psychologist to determine his sanity at the time of the shooting, the full story of Joel&#39;s family&#39;s past, and the long line of mental illness in that history, begins to unfold. Told mainly through Joel&#39;s pre-trial interview sessions with Dr. Andrews, Blood and Circumstance takes on the argument of nature versus nurture. And as Joel responds to his doctor&#39;s questions, he begins to evaluate the doctor, stealing glimpses of the session notes and noticing aspects leading to speculations about the doctor&#39;s personal life. As the reader listens in on their conversations, it becomes more and more difficult to decide what to believe, who, if either, is trustworthy, what happened for certain, what is truth? With his signature prose and unwavering close-up lens, Frank Turner Hollon&#39;s novel examines the uncertain search for identiy through the criss-crossing paths of blood and circumstance." />
