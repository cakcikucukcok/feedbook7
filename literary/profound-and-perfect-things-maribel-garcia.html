  <title>Profound and Perfect Things - Maribel Garcia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="•	Women—especially middle-aged women—are the largest book-buying demographic. There are 157 million women in the United States, and stories about bonds between sisters and mother-daughter bonds have strong appeal.   
•	According to national estimates, roughly 15 to 20 percent of all pregnancies in the United States end in miscarriage, defined as the loss of a fetus before the 20th week. The majority of miscarriages occur within the first seven weeks of pregnancy.
•	The portion of American adults identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) increased to 4.1% in 2016 from 3.5% in 2012. These figures, drawn from the largest representative sample of LGBT Americans collected in the U.S., imply that more than an estimated 10 million adults now identify as LGBT in the U.S. today.
•	Anencephaly is one of the most common types of neural tube defect, affecting about 1 in 1,000 pregnancies. However, most of these pregnancies end in miscarriage, so the prevalence of this condition in newborns is much lower. An estimated 1 in 10,000 infants in the United States is born with anencephaly.
AUDIENCE:
•	Adult females ages 17-65
•	Readers who enjoy reading about the US/Mexico Border and small rural towns
•	Readers of upmarket woman’s fiction (combination between literary and commercial)
•	Readers who like to read ethnic fiction
•	Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and questioning Latinas/os" />
