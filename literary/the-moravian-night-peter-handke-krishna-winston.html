  <title>The Moravian Night - Peter Handke, Krishna Winston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An odyssey through the mind and memory of a washed-up writer, from one of Europe&#39;s most provocative novelists, Nobel Prize winner Peter Handke&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mysteriously summoned to a houseboat on the Morava River, a few friends, associates, and collaborators of an old writer listen as he tells a story that will last until dawn: the tale of the once well-known writer&#39;s recent odyssey across Europe. As his story unfolds, it visits places that represent stages of the narrator&#39;s and the continent&#39;s past, many now lost or irrecoverably changed through war, death, and the subtler erosions of time. His wanderings take him from the Balkans to Spain, Germany, and Austria, from a congress of experts on noise sickness to a clandestine international gathering of jew&#39;s-harp virtuosos. His story and its telling are haunted by a beautiful stranger, a woman who has a preternatural hold over the writer and appears sometimes as a demon, sometimes as the longed-for destination of his travels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powerfully alive, honest, and at times deliciously satirical, &lt;i&gt;The Moravian Night&lt;/i&gt; explores the mind and memory of an aging writer, tracking the anxieties, angers, fears, and pleasures of a life inseparable from the recent history of Central Europe. In crystalline prose, Peter Handke traces and interrogates his own thoughts and perceptions while endowing the world with a mythic dimension. As Jeffrey Eugenides writes, &quot;Handke&#39;s sharp eye is always finding a strange beauty amid this colorless world.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Moravian Night&lt;/i&gt; is at once an elegy for the lost and forgotten and a novel of self-examination and uneasy discovery, from one of world literature&#39;s great voices.&lt;/p&gt;" />
