          &lt;strong&gt;She dreamed of having a family&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a little girl, Tess Wheaton wished that her father would come back and rescue her–but he never did. Although Tess grew up in the care of a loving guardian, she never had the parents she longed for. These days, she&#39;s a successful businesswoman and family is the last thing on her mind.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Now family has found her&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That is, until she discovers that the father who abandoned her long ago is dead and has left behind two young children who want Tess to be part of their lives. She steps, hesitantly at first, into this makeshift family and finds herself on a fascinating journey–getting to know her brother and sister and discovering the father she barely knew. Most fascinating of all–she&#39;s finding real love for the first time, with a man who understands what it&#39;s like to get a second chance.&lt;/p&gt;
