  <title>Sutterfeld, You Are Not a Hero - Tom Stern</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Charleston Sutterfeld does what people do: shows up to work, tends to assigned tasks, avoids conflict and complication. Sure, he occasionally ponders whether a personal greatness might exist somewhere inside of him &amp;#151; as anyone, he presumes, might naturally wonder. But his life seldom offers occasion to descend to such introspective depths.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Until an innocent oversight brings Charleston face to face with an unexpected bit of information about a man known simply as Mr. Twytharp &amp;#151; the revered and reclusive founder of Thundercom Corporation, a company known as the universe&#39;s single largest manufacturer of all things material. Housed in a towering 86-floor building, Thundercom has revolutionized business. But as Charleston unwittingly discovers, the lauded humanitarian at the center of the company&#39;s success barely resembles &amp;#151; in appearance, at least &amp;#151; the human beings whose culture he has so advanced.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rather than proving his undoing, this discovery brings about Charleston&#39;s inexplicable rise to the top of Thundercom&#39;s bizarre ranks. His success requires that he keep from asking one simple question. A question he has heretofore seldom asked. A question that is now proving irrepressible. A question that is deeply threatening to the most powerful man-like thing in the global economy.&lt;/div&gt;" />
