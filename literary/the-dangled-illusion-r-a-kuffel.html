  <title>The Dangled Illusion - R. A. Kuffel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Dangled Illusion&lt;/I&gt; is the story of Raef Burnham, who works at
WorldFoods, an American food company. When Raef is first hired,
he&#39;s placed on the leadership track and becomes a team leader within
two years. But after sixteen years of dutiful service, he finds himself
suddenly demoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raef struggles with telling his wife about the shattering news and
wonders whether he should look for another job. The prospect of
moving, however, is too much to bear, and so he resolves to put his
career back on track. But Fortune Montag, the powerful vice
president-and the ultimate company man, who thinks and acts like
the corporation-stalls him at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Dangled Illusion&lt;/I&gt; is vindication for all those people who work at a
job that shuns individuality and fails to reward its most talented
employees. It&#39;s for those who didn&#39;t get to be the boss, who never
made it to the next level, and who could never beat the forces aligned
against them in an era of globalization and hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
