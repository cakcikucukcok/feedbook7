          &lt;strong&gt;WAS SHE THIS MAN&#39;S WIFE? &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;His voice caressed Alexandra into consciousness. His eyes, dark and mysterious as midnight, held loss and longing. His tightly leashed strength seemed her sole lifeline in a terrifying sea of amnesia. But who was this Richard Jordan who called her his bride? Months ago, Richard had returned from a dangerous assignment to learn his new wife had vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Although the jaded millionaire had loved Alexandra and her sweet innocence more than life itself, their hasty marriage had been quickly destroyed by lies. But having found her at last, Richard vowed he&#39;d make his lost-and-found bride stay found forever.&lt;/p&gt;
