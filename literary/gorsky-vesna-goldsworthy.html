  <title>Gorsky - Vesna Goldsworthy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;On a rainy afternoon in London&#39;s old Chelsea, a charming  multi-billionaire Russian oligarch, Gorsky, walks into an ailing bookshop and  writes the first of several quarter-of-a-million pound checks. With that money,  Gorsky has tasked Nikola, the store&#39;s bored and brilliant clerk, with sourcing  books for a massive personal library, which which will be housed in the magnificent,  palatial home Gorsky happens to be building immediately next to Nikola&#39;s own  modest dwelling. Gorsky needs a tasteful collection of Russian literature to  woo a long-lost love--no matter that she happens to be married to an Englishman.  His passion for her surpasses even his immeasurable wealth, and Nikola will be  drawn into a world of opulence, greed, capitalism, sex, and beauty as he helps  Gorsky pursue this doomed love.     Charmingly written and inspired by The Great Gatsby, Gorsky is a vicarious thrill--an ode to cosmopolitan taste and a  brilliant reimagining of a powerful classic.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
