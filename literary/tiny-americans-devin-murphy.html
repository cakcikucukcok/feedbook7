  <title>Tiny Americans - Devin Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the National Bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Boat Runner&lt;/em&gt; comes a poignant, luminous novel that follows one family over decades and across the world&amp;#8212;perfect for fans of the film &lt;em&gt;Boyhood&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Western New York, 1978&lt;/em&gt;: Jamie, Lewis, and Connor Thurber watch their parents&amp;#8217; destructive dance of loving, hating, and drinking. Terrance Thurber spends this year teaching his children about the natural world: they listen to the heartbeat of trees, track animal footprints, sleep under the star-filled sky. Despite these lessons, he doesn&amp;#8217;t show them how to survive without him. And when these seasons of trying and failing to quit booze and be a better man are over, Terrance is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alone with their artist mother, Catrin, the Thurber children are left to grapple with the anger they feel for the one parent who deserted them and a growing resentment for the one who didn&amp;#8217;t. As Catrin withdraws into her own world, Jamie throws herself into painting while her brothers smash out their rage in brutal, no-holds-barred football games with neighborhood kids. Once they can leave&amp;#8212;Jamie for college, Lewis for the navy, and Connor for work&amp;#8212;they don&amp;#8217;t look back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Terrance does. Crossing the country, sobering up, and starting over has left him with razor-sharp regret. Terrance doesn&amp;#8217;t know that Jamie, now an academic, inhabits an ever-shrinking circle of loneliness; that Lewis, a merchant marine, fears life on dry land; that Connor struggles to connect with the son he sees teetering on an all-too-familiar edge. He only knows that he has one last try to build a bridge, through the years, to his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Composed of a series of touchstone moments, &lt;em&gt;Tiny Americans&lt;/em&gt; is a thrilling and bittersweet rendering of a family that, much like the tides, continues to come together and drift apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
