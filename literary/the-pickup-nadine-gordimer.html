  <title>The Pickup - Nadine Gordimer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Nobel Laureate&#39;s psychologically penetrating story of the love affair between a rich South African and the illegal alien she &quot;picks up&quot; on a whim&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who picked up whom? Is the pickup the illegal immigrant desperate to evade deportation to his impoverished desert country? Or is the pickup the powerful businessman&#39;s daughter trying to escape a priveleged background she despises? When Julie Summers&#39; car breaks down in a sleazy street, at a garage a young Arab emerges from beneath the chassis of a vehicle to aid her. The consequences develop as a story of unpredictably relentless emotions that overturn each one&#39;s notion of the other, and of the solutions life demands for different circumstances. She insists on leaving the country with him. The love affair becomes a marriage-that state she regards as a social convention appropriate to her father&#39;s set and her mother remarried in California, but decreed by her &#39;grease monkey&#39; in order to present her respectably to his family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Arab village, while he is dedicated to escaping, again, to what he believes is a fulfilling life in the West, she is drawn by a counter-magnet of new affinities in his close family and the omnipresence of the desert. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A novel of great power and concision, psychological surprises and unexpected developments, The Pickup is a story of the rites of passage that are emigration/immigration, where love can survive only if stripped of all certainties outside itself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
