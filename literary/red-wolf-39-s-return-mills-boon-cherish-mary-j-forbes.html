  <title>Red Wolf&#39;s Return (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) - Mary J. Forbes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="

          &lt;strong&gt;First love–found. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Meg McKee kept the peace in Sweet Creek as the no-nonsense chief of police. But to elusive Ethan Red Wolf, Meggie wasn&#39;t just the town&#39;s most capable officer. She was the soul mate he&#39;d run away from, the woman the half-Blackfoot teenager felt he&#39;d never be worthy of. Meg&#39;s life hadn&#39;t turned out as she&#39;d expected, either.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her marriage had fallen into tatters after she&#39;d conquered breast cancer, and her teenaged son was acting out–on Ethan&#39;s land. She knew Ethan still made her heart soar like the eagles that swooped above Sweet Creek&#39;s countryside. But would the lingering shadows of the past fade in time to offer them another chance at love–this time, forever?&lt;/p&gt;
