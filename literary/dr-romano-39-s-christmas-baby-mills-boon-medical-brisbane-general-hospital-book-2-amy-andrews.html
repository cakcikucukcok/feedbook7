  <title>Dr Romano&#39;s Christmas Baby (Mills &amp; Boon Medical) (Brisbane General Hospital, Book 2) - Amy Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Enter into the world of high-flying Doctors as they navigate the pressures of modern medicine and find escape, passion, comfort and love – in each other’s arms!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A family by Christmas… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nurse Rilla Winters is shocked to learn the new A&amp;E Director at Brisbane General is her husband! It’s been seven years since they drifted apart after her miscarriage, but the reappearance of Luca Romano, in all his dark-haired, flashing-eyed Italian glory, throws her emotions into confusion!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From the moment he sees Rilla again, Luca knows his wife is the only woman for him. With emotions riding high, they spend one very special night together and Rilla falls pregnant – again…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This tiny new life is a symbol of hope – maybe Luca and Rilla can really become a family by Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
