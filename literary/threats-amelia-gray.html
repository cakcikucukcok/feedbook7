  <title>Threats - Amelia Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;David&#39;s wife is dead. At least, he thinks she&#39;s dead. But he can&#39;t figure out what killed her or why she had to die, and his efforts to sort out what&#39;s happened have been interrupted by his discovery of a series of elaborate and escalating threats hidden in strange places around his home--one buried in the sugar bag, another carved into the side of his television. These disturbing threats may be the best clues to his wife&#39;s death: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CURL UP ON MY LAP. LET ME BRUSH YOUR HAIR WITH MY FINGERS. I AM SINGING YOU A LULLABY. I AM TESTING FOR STRUCTURAL WEAKNESS IN YOUR SKULL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detective Chico is also on the case, and is intent on asking David questions he doesn&#39;t know the answers to and introducing him to people who don&#39;t appear to have David&#39;s or his wife&#39;s best interests in mind. With no one to trust, David is forced to rely on his own memories and faculties--but they too are proving unreliable. &lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;THREATS&lt;/i&gt;, Amelia Gray builds a world that is bizarre yet familiar, violent yet tender. It is an electrifying story of love and loss that grabs you on the first page and never loosens its grip.&lt;/p&gt;" />
