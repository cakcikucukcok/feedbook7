  <title>Don Juan - Peter Handke, Krishna Winston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nobel Prize winner Peter Handke offers a wry and entertaining take on history&#39;s most famous seducer as he takes a respite from his stressful existence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don Juan&#39;s story--&quot;his own version&quot;--is filtered through the consciousness of an anonymous narrator, a failed innkeeper and chef, into whose solitude Don Juan bursts one day. On each day of the week that follows, Don Juan describes the adventures he experienced on that same day a week earlier. The adventures are erotic, but Handke&#39;s Don Juan is more pursued than pursuer. What makes his accounts riveting are the remarkable evocations of places and people, and the nature of his narration. &lt;i&gt;Don Juan: His Own Version&lt;/i&gt; is, above all, a book about storytelling and its ability to burst the ordinary boundaries of time and space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this brief and wry volume, Peter Handke conjures images and depicts the subtleties of human interaction with an unforgettable vividness. Along the way, he offers a sharp commentary on many features of contemporary life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
