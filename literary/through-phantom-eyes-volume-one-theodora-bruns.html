  <title>Through Phantom Eyes: Volume One - Theodora Bruns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Erik is only a young boy when he first discovers his great passion for music. Just before his third birthday, he listens to his mother playing the piano, and with excitement, he realizes his life will always be filled with music. Sadly though, along with that powerful and comforting emotion, there is also sorrow. Erik&#39;s mother fears him because of his facial deformity, and he is forever scarred by her rejection. His father loves and protects him and tries to guide his young son&#39;s rapidly growing genius mind and disturbed heart. Nevertheless, Erik&#39;s soul begins to fill with loathing for the world that shuns him, causing him to wage a fierce battle between murderous hatred and compassionate love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Erik&#39;s temper erupts violently at times, endangering the lives of those around him as well as his own. Ultimately, he is abandoned and left alone to battle not only a world destined to cause him harm but also his tortured heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover the astonishing life of Erik, and journey into the private world and intimate thoughts of the man known as the Phantom of the Opera. Be with him as he struggles to balance his brilliant mind and tormented soul.&lt;/p&gt;" />
