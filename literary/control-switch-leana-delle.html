  <title>Control Switch - Leana Delle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Candace Bradford likes to describe herself as strong-willed and always in control. It is no secret that the Chicago-based life coach, radio personality, and author of a new hit book appears headed for international celebrity. Determined to master her life and control her destiny, Candace is certain that nothing will stand in her way of achieving everything she has ever wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Candaces new PR agent lines her up with numerous speaking engagements, Candace is thrilled, but as usual, her attorney husband, Ross, is distracted with his own career issues. Her concerns about her marriage grow, but she moves forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then things begin to go wrong. The results of an exploratory surgery cause Candaces life to unravel, and her health suddenly takes a turn for the worse. With her marriage in trouble, Candace becomes the victim of scandalous rumors and helplessly watches as her dream dissolves under public scrutiny. But when a guarded family secret is finally revealed, Candace must bravely face her past and reassess herself and her beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this poignant tale, a high-powered media personality takes an emotional journey of self-discovery from an insatiable desire for international recognition to forgiveness and the long road home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
