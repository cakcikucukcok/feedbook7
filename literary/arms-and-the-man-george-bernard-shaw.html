  <title>Arms and the Man - George Bernard Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Arms and the Man is a comedy by George Bernard Shaw, whose title comes from the opening words of Virgil&amp;#39;s Aeneid, in Latin: Arma virumque cano (&amp;quot;Of arms and the man I sing&amp;quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The play was first produced on 21 April 1894 at the Avenue Theatre and published in 1898 as part of Shaw&amp;#39;s Plays Pleasant volume, which also included Candida, You Never Can Tell, and The Man of Destiny. Arms and the Man was one of Shaw&amp;#39;s first commercial successes. He was called onto stage after the curtain, where he received enthusiastic applause. Amidst the cheers, one audience member booed. Shaw replied, in characteristic fashion, &amp;quot;My dear fellow, I quite agree with you, but what are we two against so many?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Arms and the Man is a humorous play that shows the futility of war and deals comedically with the hypocrisies of human nature." />
