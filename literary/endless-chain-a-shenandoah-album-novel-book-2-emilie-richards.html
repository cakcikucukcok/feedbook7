  <title>Endless Chain (A Shenandoah Album Novel, Book 2) - Emilie Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;With the warmth and comfort of a handmade quilt, Endless Chain explores the intricate patterns of family and community, and the threads that bind them together.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;?Sam Kinkade is finally feeling at home as a minister in rural Toms Brook, Virginia, content with his life and Shenandoah Valley congregation. But his plans to welcome the area&#39;s growing Hispanic community are being met with resistance. Fortunately, when the church-run community center is threatened, a stranger named Elisa Martinez walks through his door and Sam realizes he has found a woman capable of building bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Elisa isn&#39;t looking to make connections. She has come to Toms Brook to hide. But despite her fears of discovery she is enchanted by the beautiful work and the friendship offered by the women who invite her to join their quilting circle. And even though she fears the consequences for both of them, she finds herself powerfully drawn to Sam, and to a generations-old love story rooted in the town&#39;s past.&lt;br /&gt;Will she and Sam repeat the past, or can they find the love and the freedom they seek at last?&lt;/p&gt;
