Both his own dreams and those of his young family are on the line, while on the other side of town, in a rough neighborhood, his son and young wife, Susheela, wait for him, which is all too often the case. And when Susheela falls victim to an outrageous bias crime, the balance of the lives of all four Fitzgeralds&amp;#151;Susheela, Robbie, their son, Vincent, and unborn daughter, Ellie, will reverberate with this snowy night&amp;#8217;s incident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Over thirteen years of struggle, aspiration, achievement, misunderstandings, near misses, and compromised or lost dreams, Helen Walsh plunges us into the lives and loves, indeed the fabric, of the Fitzgeralds.
