  <title>Tin Moon - Blakely Chorpenning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nora Cravis, a quirky and curious young woman, experiences life in Granville County, North Carolina, with her family. Unable to conceive or conform to the expectations of an early twentieth century woman, Nora struggles to maintain a meaningful relationship with her parents after her younger sister, Shailene, disappears. While trying to reconcile the devastation of her loss, clues soon emerge, leading Nora down a murky path of family secrets to a lover&amp;#39;s betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Had you asked me before I married Rathe, before she left us, what the world was like, I would have said God shaped the moon in the likeness of Shailene&amp;#39;s full cheeks. I would have been careless not to mention the delicate touch of her fingers on the material she so often sewed with Momma in the glorious light of the front window. How her giggle pulled a shadow of a smile from our daddy when I said something terrible under my breath. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Shailene and I spent our nights counting stars, wishing on the ones we thought went most overlooked. And when the world flipped inside out, it stole Shailene and all the stars, leaving me in a frightful darkness. I became a different person without a moon for balance. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I became a different person when the truth found me.&amp;quot; &lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
