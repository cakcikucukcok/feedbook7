  <title>Axeman&#39;s Jazz - Tracy Daugherty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;A stunning tour de force, Tracy Daugherty&amp;#8217;s fourth novel explores the volatility of race, class, and economics as they affect three generations of a Houston, Texas, family, and traces the rise and decline of an inner city neighborhood from the point of view of a prodigal daughter. Twenty-something Telisha Washington returns after many years to the decaying Houston neighborhood where she was born, to renew old ties and come to terms with her family&amp;#8217;s enigmatic heritage. The product of a racially mixed union, she has spent her life straddling received definitions of race, class, gender, and culture. Her personal odyssey is centered inside a black neighborhood&amp;#8217;s convulsions, where violence, poverty, and the politics of gentrification take their toll. An unflinching meditation on family, race, sex, and love, as well as a dissection of public and private identity, Axeman&amp;#8217;s Jazz is a stark, but loving, portrait of contemporary urban America.&lt;/div&gt;" />
