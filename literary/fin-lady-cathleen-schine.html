  <title>Fin &amp; Lady - Cathleen Schine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;The Three Weissmanns of Westport&lt;/i&gt;, a wise, clever story of New York in the &#39;60s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s 1964. Eleven-year-old Fin and his glamorous, worldly, older half sister, Lady, have just been orphaned, and Lady, whom Fin hasn&#39;t seen in six years, is now his legal guardian and his only hope. That means Fin is uprooted from a small dairy farm in rural Connecticut to Greenwich Village, smack in the middle of the swinging &#39;60s. He soon learns that Lady-giddy, careless, urgent, and obsessed with being free-is as much his responsibility as he is hers.&lt;br&gt;     So begins &lt;i&gt;Fin &amp; Lady&lt;/i&gt;, the lively, spirited new novel by Cathleen Schine, the author of the bestselling &lt;i&gt;The Three Weissmanns of Westport&lt;/i&gt;. Fin and Lady lead their lives against the background of the &#39;60s, the civil rights movement, and the Vietnam War-Lady pursued by ardent, dogged suitors, Fin determined to protect his impulsive sister from them and from herself.&lt;br&gt;     From a writer &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; has praised as &quot;sparkling, crisp, clever, deft, hilarious, and deeply affecting,&quot; &lt;i&gt;Fin &amp; Lady&lt;/i&gt; is a comic, romantic love story: the story of a brother and sister who must form their own unconventional family in increasingly unconventional times.&lt;/p&gt;" />
