  <title>His Arranged Marriage (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) - Tina Leonard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Texas Sheikhs: Though their veins course with royal blood, their pride lies in the Texas land they call home!&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE TWIN BROTHER&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cade Coleman knew that a royal arranged marriage was the only option to honor his family&#39;s long-promised alliance. He just couldn&#39;t let his brother go through with the impending nuptials to a woman he&#39;d never met. Yet when Cade posed as his identical twin, the carefree playboy never counted on the allure of vivacious Princess Serena. She tested his rock-solid self-control with her fiery kisses and her proclamations that she wanted to be his wife–in every sense of the word. And though Cade was desperate to claim Serena–body and soul–dare he forget that she was rightfully his brother&#39;s intended bride?&lt;/p&gt;
