  <title>3,000 Miles - Jason Schneider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nirvana&#39;s Kurt Cobain could not have envisioned what his death would mean to Generation X - or that he would influence one young man from small-town Quebec to take his own life . . .
3,000 Miles is the story of Andre, a man entering his twenties with very little going for him. The only stabilizing influence in his life is music, but the news of Kurt Cobain&#39;s suicide finally pushes him over the edge. He leaves town and joins his friends Richard and Stephane in Quebec City to sell drugs. Eventually, the reserves of his self-centred nihilism run dry, and this prompts him to devise a plan: the trio will embark on a journey across North America. When they reach the end-Seattle-they&#39;ll sacrifice themselves.
Andre&#39;s problem, of course, is convincing his friends to join him, but they decide to call his bluff. Their own young lives are in constant turmoil, and a road trip seems like the perfect distraction. But things quickly move from bad to worse when Andre&#39;s spurned girlfriend, Sylvie, makes her own cross-country journey in a last-ditch attempt to prove her love.
If Kerouac&#39;s On The Road mapped the landscape of a new America, 3,000 Miles explores its ultimate dead end." />
