  <title>Flirting With Disaster (The Charleston Trilogy, Book 2) - Sherryl Woods</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Opposites attract, but they don’t last.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;At least that’s what improper Southern belle Maggie Forsythe thinks after being unceremoniously dumped two weeks before getting hitched to a man even her mother approves of. Maggie has never given two figs what anyone thinks, so why is she hiding away from her South Carolina Low Country home?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That is until concerned—albeit scheming—friends arrive with three options: One: Sit and mope. Two: Go home to her gallery. Three: Help them build a house for a needy family and make a difference for once. But one look at Maggie, and project foreman Josh Parker knows what kind of sweet-tea-swilling debutante he’s dealingwith. Even if she does know her way around a circular saw.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sure, they have enough sparks to ignite a bonfire, but he’s corn bread to her caviar. And if there’s anything he’s learned from growing up broke, it’s better to aim low than risk everything and lose.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Sherryl Woods is a uniquely gifted writer whose deep understanding of human nature is woven into every page. ” —&lt;em&gt; New York Times bestselling author Carla Neggers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
