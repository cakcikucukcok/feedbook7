  <title>As God Commands - Niccolo Ammaniti, Jonathan Hunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;From the internationally best-selling author of &lt;I&gt;I&amp;#8217;m Not Scared&lt;/I&gt; comes a dizzying and compulsively readable novel set in a moribund town in industrial Italy, where a father and son contend with a hostile world and their own inner demons. The economically depressed village of Varrano, where Cristiano Zena lives with his hard-drinking, out-of-work father, Rino, is a world away from the picturesque towns of travel-brochure Italy. When Rino and his rough-edged cronies Danilo and Quattro Formaggi come up with a plan to reverse all their fortunes, Cristiano wonders if maybe their lives are poised for deliverance after all. &amp;#160;But the plan goes horribly awry. On a night of apocalyptic weather, each character will act in a way that will have irreversible consequences for themselves and others, and Cristiano will find his life changed forever, and not in the way he had hoped. Gritty and relentless, &lt;I&gt;As God Commands&lt;/I&gt; moves at breakneck speed, blending brutal violence, dark humor, and surprising tenderness. With clear-eyed affection, Niccol&amp;#242; Ammaniti introduces a cast of unforgettable characters trapped at the crossroads of hope and despair.&lt;/div&gt;" />
