        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Enter into the world of high-flying Doctors as they navigate the pressures of modern medicine and find escape, passion, comfort and love – in each other’s arms!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The boss’s new-found family&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Two friends and one orphaned girl might not seem like the average family – but to Medical Director Charles Wetherby and Director of Nursing Jill Shaw it’s everything. Yet if they are to keep little Lily they must adopt her – and that means marriage. Charles offers Jill a marriage of convenience – wanting more but always believing his injuries will stop him finding love. But Jill sees beneath his surface – how could she not want this caring, sexy, successful man? She just needs the courage to tell him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Charles and Jill’s simmering emotions are unleashed when Lily suffers from a mystery illness. This could be their one opportunity to become the loving family they all need so much.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CROCODILE CREEK &lt;em&gt;A cutting-edge medical centre. Fully equipped for saving lives and loves!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
