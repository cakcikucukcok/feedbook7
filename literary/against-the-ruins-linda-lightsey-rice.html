  <title>Against the Ruins - Linda Lightsey Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On a December day in 1957, schoolteacher Louise Copeland and her six-year-old daughter, Lyra, come home to discover that Louises gentle war-hero husband has suddenly become psychotic and has slashed his wrist with a razor blade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that moment on, everything Louise has believed in unravels. In their inner-city Southern neighborhood, situated between a cemetery and a madhouse, a place of leafy oak trees and ghosts, three other people become involved in Louises crisis: Rosa, the scandalous divorcee who entertains men for a living; Uta, the mysterious elderly lady who casts spells; and Max, the clairvoyant gravedigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, as Louise is dying, her daughter returns home, and she and her mother confront how the family was torn asunder in 1957. Louise finally reveals the long-held secret that haunted the family for the next fifty years.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This poignant novel is a gripping drama of madness and prejudice in which a mother leaves her daughter, ultimately, with hope.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Linda Lightsey Rice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against the Ruins contains such gorgeous writing that it nearly takes your breath away, with a sense of humor and a fine appreciation of the ridiculous even amid great agony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natalie Goldberg &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rice has a fiery, incandescent talent. &lt;/p&gt;
