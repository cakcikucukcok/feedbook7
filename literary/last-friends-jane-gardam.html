  <title>Last Friends - Jane Gardam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book Three in Jane Gardam&#39;s Old Filth trilogy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Last Friends&lt;/i&gt; is the third and concluding novel in the highly praised trilogy that began with &lt;i&gt;Old Filth &lt;/i&gt;and continued with &lt;i&gt;The Man in the Wooden Hat. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The haunting first novel was the story of a decades-long marriage that stretched from the immediate post-World War II period into the opening of the twenty-first century. Sir Edward Feathers (Old Filth) was a captivating character: so clever, so triumphantly his own man, so wounded by his dreadful childhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Man in the Wooden Hat &lt;/i&gt;was Betty&#39;s story. She and Sir Edward met and married in Hong Kong. She was surdy and dependable, the exemplary wife of an eminent lawyer. She owned two exceptional strands of pearls given to her by two men, who desired her and despised each other with equal authority. This second, equally witty, novel weighed the difference between marriage and romance with great subtlety and understanding. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Last Friends &lt;/i&gt;is Terence Veneering&#39;s turn. His beginnings were not those of the usual establishment grandee. Filth&#39;s hated rival in court and in love is the son of a Russian acrobat marooned in the English midlands and a local girl. He escapes the war and later emerges in the Far East as a man of panache and fame. The Bar treats his success with suspicion: where did this handsome, brilliant Slav come from? This exquisite story of Veneering, Filth, and their circle tells a bittersweet tale of friendship and grace and of the disappoinments and consolations of age. They are all, finally, each other&#39;s last friend as this magnificent series ends with the deep and abiding satisfaction that only great literature provides." />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Last Friends - Jane Gardam</i></b> | Last Friends is the third novel in Jane Gardam’s trilogy that began with Old Filth and continued with The Man in the Wooden Hat. Having read and loved both those novels, I felt pretty sure what to expect in this last book. The first focused on Sir Edward Feathers, barrister in Hong Kong and London, promoted to judge, Old Filth himself.<br /><b><i>Last Friends (Old Filth, #3) by Jane Gardam</i></b> | “Last Friends” is the third novel in Jane Gardam’s series about a dying generation. Society is no longer so tolerant towards the post-war arrogance of public school and Oxbridge educated lawyers and their ditzy wives, Often so much what is not in a story that makes it a good read; what is left out gives pause for much intriguing thought.<br /><b><i>Last Friends (Old Filth Trilogy): Gardam, Jane ...</i></b> | Praise for Last Friends "The satisfying conclusion to Gardam's Old Filth trilogy offers exquisite prose, wry humor, and keen insights into aging and death." —The New Yorker "Last Friends is evocative, elegiac, and shaded in autumnal tones, as suits the final volume in a trilogy.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Last Friends - Jane Gardam</a> </h3></p><hr/>
