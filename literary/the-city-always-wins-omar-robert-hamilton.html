  <title>The City Always Wins - Omar Robert Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Named as one of the Best Books of 2017 by &lt;i&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt; and The Arts Desk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;We&#39;ve been doing the same thing for hundreds of years. Marching, fighting, chanting, dying, changing, winning, losing . This time will be different. This time the future can still be made new.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The City Always Wins&lt;/i&gt; is a novel from the front line of a revolution. Deeply enmeshed in the 2011 uprising in Tahrir Square, Mariam and Khalil move through Cairo&#39;s surging streets and roiling political underground, their lives burning with purpose, their city alive in open revolt, the world watching, listening, as they chart a course into an unknown future. They are--they believe--fighting a new kind of revolution; they are players in a new epic in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as regimes crumble and the country shatters into ideological extremes, Khalil and Mariam&#39;s commitment--to the ideals of revolution and to one another--is put to the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the highs of street battles against the police to the paralysis of authoritarianism, Omar Robert Hamilton&#39;s bold debut cuts straight from the heart of one of the key chapters of the twenty-first century.Arrestingly visual, intensely lyrical, uncompromisingly political, and brutal in its poetry, &lt;i&gt;The City Always Wins&lt;/i&gt; is a novel not just about Egypt&#39;s revolution, but also about a global generation that tried to change the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
