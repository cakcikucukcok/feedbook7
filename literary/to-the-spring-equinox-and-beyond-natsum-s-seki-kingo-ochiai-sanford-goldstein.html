  <title>To the Spring Equinox and Beyond - Natsumé Sôseki, Kingo Ochiai, Sanford Goldstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;This classic Japanese story by Soseki Netsume&amp;#151;the foremost novelist of the Meiji Period&amp;#8212;is a masterpiece of Japanese literature.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This book demonstrates Soseki Natsume&#39;s ability to dissect and elucidate the human personality in all its complexity. Here, his facile blending of narrative, extended monologue and sharp dialog leaves the reader with an almost personal knowledge of the characters. We are introduced to Keitaro, a recent college graduate hunting for his first job; he is the hero through whose eyes the other characters are seen. There is also Morimoto, the young adventurer with his tall tales; Sunaga, a troubled young man whose moving story forms the center of the novel; Taguchi, Sunaga&#39;s fun&amp;#150;loving yet practical uncle; Matsumoto, another uncle&amp;#150;a high&amp;#150;class &quot;idler,&quot; but wise in his own way; and Chiyoko, Sunaga&#39;s cousin and apparently the cause of much of his distress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Keitaro does not merely tell us the story of the others, however. Their lives are a part of his elucidation beyond that of the world of academia, and his knowing them enables him eventually to experience, however directly or indirectly, the romantic, the practical, the philosophical, and the existential.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
