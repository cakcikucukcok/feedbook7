  <title>Woes of the True Policeman - Roberto Bolano, Natasha Wimmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Begun in the 1980s and worked on until the author&#39;s death in 2003, &lt;i&gt;Woes of the True &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Policeman &lt;/i&gt;is Roberto Bolaño&#39;s last, unfinished novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The novel follows Óscar Amalfitano--an exiled Chilean university professor and widower--through the maze of his revolutionary past, his relationship with his teenage daughter, Rosa, his passion for a former student, and his retreat from scandal in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forced to leave Barcelona for Santa Teresa, a Mexican city close to the U.S. border where women are being killed in unprecedented numbers, Amalfitano soon begins an affair with Castillo, a young forger of Larry Rivers paintings. Meanwhile, Rosa, Amalfitano&#39;s daughter, engages in her own epistolary romance with a basketball player from Barcelona, while still trying to cope with her mother&#39;s early death and her father&#39;s secrets. After finding Castillo in bed with her father, Rosa is forced to confront her own crisis. What follows is an intimate police investigation of Amalfitano that involves a series of dark twists, culminating in a finale full of euphoria and heartbreak.&lt;br&gt;Featuring characters and stories from his other books, &lt;i&gt;Woes of the True Policeman &lt;/i&gt;invites the reader more than ever into the world of Roberto Bolaño. It is an exciting, kaleidoscopic novel, lyrical and intense, yet darkly humorous. Exploring the roots of memory and the limits of art, &lt;i&gt;Woes of the True Policeman &lt;/i&gt;marks the culmination of one of the great careers of world literature.&lt;/p&gt;" />
