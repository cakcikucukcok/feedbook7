  <title>The Year of the Comet - Sergei Lebedev, Antonina W. Bouis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A clear poetic sensibility built to stand against the forces of erasure.&quot;&amp;#151;&lt;I&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lebedev takes his place beside Solzhenitsyn and other great writers who have refused to abide by silence.&quot;&amp;#151;&lt;I&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the critically acclaimed author of &lt;I&gt;Oblivion &lt;/I&gt;comes &lt;I&gt;Year of the Comet&lt;/I&gt;, a story of a Russian boyhood and coming of age as the Soviet Union is on the brink of collapse. An idyllic childhood takes a sinister turn.  Rumors of a serial killer haunt the neighborhood, families pack up and leave town without a word of warning, and the country begins to unravel. Policemen stand by as protesters overtake the streets, knowing that the once awe-inspiring symbols of power they wear on their helmets have become devoid of meaning. Lebedev depicts a vast empire coming apart at the seams, transforming a very public moment into something tender and personal, and writes with stunning beauty and shattering insight about childhood and the growing consciousness of a boy in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sergei Lebedev &lt;/B&gt;was born in Moscow in 1981 and worked for seven years on geological expeditions in Russia and Central Asia. Lebedev is a poet, essayist and journalist. &lt;I&gt;Oblivion&lt;/I&gt;, his first novel, was published in 2016 by New Vessel Press, to great acclaim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
