  <title>Infinite Souls - A.J. Rwaka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After losing his wife, John is faced with the challenge of living without her. A feeling of desperation and loneliness consumes him due to this loss and adding to it all; the responsibilities he is obligated to handle as a part of life. Even with her death, life has to go on; so insists his mother in law. John delves into his work, surrounding himself with those closest to him; those he now considers family. He finds a way to cope with the card his been dealt; paying his deads wife tremendous hospital bill within the month, paying off his mortgage and car loan in that same month. As is with all who have their wits about them, questions arise; how is he doing it? So asks the mother in law. Well June, the trick is to get on Interpols watch list and how do you do that? Its simple really, when the person you most deeply care about dies; you dont only lose them but you also lose a part of your soul, creating a void that cant possibly be filled. Although, not all is set in stone; John finds another reason for living. Something thing just as strong as his love for his wife, maybe even stronger; but as it always stands what can go wrong, will go wrong. Especially, when the people closest to you are responsible. When the answers become vague, leading to more questions. Who does he become when whats left of his soul disappears?" />
