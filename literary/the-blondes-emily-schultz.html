  <title>The Blondes - Emily Schultz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Blondes&lt;/i&gt; is a hilarious and whipsmart novel where an epidemic of a rabies-like disease is carried only by blonde women, all of whom must go to great lengths to conceal their blondness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hazel Hayes is a grad student living in New York City. As the novel opens, she learns she is pregnant (from an affair with her married professor) at an apocalyptically bad time: random but deadly attacks on passers-by, all by blonde women, are terrorizing New Yorkers. Soon it becomes clear that the attacks are symptoms of a strange illness that is transforming blondes--whether CEOs, flight attendants, students or accountants--into rabid killers. &lt;br&gt;Emily Schultz&#39;s beautifully realized novel is a mix of satire, thriller, and serious literary work. With biting satiric wit, The Blondes is at once an examination of the complex relationships between women, and a merciless but giddily enjoyable portrait of what happens in a world where beauty is--literally--deadly.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The Blondes - Emily Schultz</i></b> | “Emily Schultz is my new hero.” ―Stephen King. The Blondes is a hilarious and whip-smart novel where an epidemic of a rabies-like disease is carried only by blonde women, all of whom must go to great lengths to conceal their blondeness. Emily Schultz’s beautifully realized novel is a mix of satire, thriller, and serious literary work.<br /><b><i>The Blondes: A Novel: Schultz, Emily: 9781250081698 ...</i></b> | "The Blondes [aims] to be both a realist narrative about loneliness, insecurities and maternal anxieties and a fantastical, not quite allegorical tale of a semi-apocalypse. It’s a testament to author Emily Schultz’s immense gifts with tone, detail and the crafting of a compelling first-person voice that this novel is never less than engaging even when this balance begins to feel absurd."<br /><b><i>THE BLONDES | emily-schultz</i></b> | Emily Schultz is the co-founder of Joyland Magazine. Her newest novel, Little Threats, is forthcoming from GP Putnam's Sons for Summer 2020. Her novel, The Blondes, released in the U.S. with St. Martins Press and Picador, in France with Editions Asphalte, and in Canada with Doubleday. It was named a Best Book of 2015 by NPR and Kirkus.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Blondes - Emily Schultz</a> </h3></p><hr/>
