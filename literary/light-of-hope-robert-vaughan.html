  <title>Light of Hope - Robert Vaughan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is a light that never goes out. Galen Scobey has lost hope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since his wife&#39;s death seven years ago, he has thrown himself completely into two things: taking care of his beloved young son and advancing his career. He has no time for love, and no patience for holiday joy. But this Christmas Galen&#39;s job for a major oil corporation has led him to the remote town of Point Hope, Alaska. The picturesque land of snow-covered mountains and caribou is a painful reminder of the day he gave up his faith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The white tundra, unchanged and untouched by all but the native Eskimos for thousands of years, means a lot to schoolteacher Ellie Springer. Originally from Dallas, Ellie came to Alaska looking for adventure and recovery from her last romantic disaster. But when Galen arrives, Ellie finds herself siding with some of the local villagers in a fight to keep Galen and his oil company out of their majestic town. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though many obstacles stand in their way, Galen and Ellie cannot help but feel an attraction between them. But will their politics, their religion, and even the unforgiving winter weather keep them apart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a Christmas miracle can tell in this uplifting tale of love, second chances, and above all things, hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
