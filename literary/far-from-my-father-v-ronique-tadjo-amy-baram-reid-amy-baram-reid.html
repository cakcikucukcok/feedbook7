  <title>Far from My Father - Véronique Tadjo, Amy Baram Reid, Amy Baram Reid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To attain some sort of universal value,&quot; Véronique Tadjo     has said, &quot;a piece of work has to go deep into the particular in order to reveal our shared     humanity.&quot; In &lt;i&gt;Far from My Father,&lt;/i&gt; the latest novel from this     internationally acclaimed author, a woman returns to the Côte d&#39;Ivoire after her     father&#39;s death. She confronts not only unresolved family issues that she had left behind     but also questions about her own identity that arise amidst the tensions between traditional and     modern worlds. The drama that unfolds tells us much about the evolving role of women, the legacy     of polygamy, and the economic challenges of daily life in Abidjan. On a more autobiographical     level, the author depicts a daughter&#39;s efforts to come to terms with what she knew and did     not know about her father.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Set against the backdrop of civil strife that has     wracked the Côte d&#39;Ivoire since the turn of the century, this story shows Tadjo&#39;s     remarkable ability to inhabit a character&#39;s inner world and emotional landscape while     creating a narrative of great historic and cultural     dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARAF Books: Caribbean and African Literature     Translated from the French&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
