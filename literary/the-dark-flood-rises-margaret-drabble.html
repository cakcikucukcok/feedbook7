  <title>The Dark Flood Rises - Margaret Drabble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of the &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s 50 Notable Works of Fiction in 2017 and a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Notable Book of 2017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the great British novelist Dame Margaret Drabble comes a vital and audacious tale about the many ways in which we confront aging and living in a time of geopolitical rupture.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francesca Stubbs has an extremely full life. A highly regarded expert on housing for the elderly who is herself getting on in age, she drives &quot;restlessly round England,&quot; which is &quot;her last love . . . She wants to see it all before she dies.&quot; Amid the professional conferences that dominate her schedule, she fits in visits to old friends, brings home cooked dinners to her ailing ex-husband, texts her son, who is grieving over the shocking death of his girlfriend, and drops in on her daughter, a quirky young woman who lives in a flood plain in the West Country. Fran cannot help but think of her mortality, but she is &quot;not ready to settle yet, with a cat upon her knee.&quot; She still prizes her &quot;frisson of autonomy,&quot; her belief in herself as a dynamic individual doing meaningful work in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Dark Flood Rises&lt;/i&gt; moves between Fran&#39;s interconnected group of family and friends in England and a seemingly idyllic expat community in the Canary Islands. In both places, disaster looms. In Britain, the flood tides are rising, and in the Canaries, there is always the potential for a seismic event. As well, migrants are fleeing an increasingly war-torn Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though &lt;i&gt;The Dark Flood Rises&lt;/i&gt; delivers the pleasures of a traditional novel, it is clearly situated in the precarious present. Margaret Drabble&#39;s latest enthralls, entertains, and asks existential questions in equal measure. Alas, there is undeniable truth in Fran&#39;s insight: &quot;Old age, it&#39;s a fucking disaster!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
