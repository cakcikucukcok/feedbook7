  <title>The Mirror Man - David E. Juniman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Moses is a mysterious man about whom no one knows much. He is known as The Mirror Man because the profession from which he makes a living is mirror making.  However, he is so much more than that. He rents an attic room in a house, and the terms of this lease always brought happy smiles and laughter to all who heard them. Moses had no money to pay rent. At the time of the rental negotiations, he said, Everyone gives what he has. I will give you stories! He then said that he was going to tell a story right then and there, as his security deposit &lt;p&gt;
Using storytelling as a device, The Mirror Man brings a town of people together as a story within a story. He demonstrates that the unknown can be known and the possibility of experiencing higher dimensions of consciousness and wisdom happily exist. &lt;p&gt;
The stories The Mirror Man tells are hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of years old. They have survived in the consciousnesses of schooled people as well as illiterate people because they are about the human condition and because we all have something in common with what these stories impart." />
