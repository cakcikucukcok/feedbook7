  <title>Barley Patch (Australian Literature Series) - Gerald Murnane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Discover the Australian novelist ranked by Ladbrokes as a top-five contender for the 2010 Nobel Prize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barley Patch&lt;/em&gt; takes as its subject the reasons an author might abandon fiction-or so he thinks-forever. Using the form of an oblique self-interrogation, it begins with the Beckettian question &quot;Must I write?&quot; and proceeds to expand from this small, personal query to fill in the details of a landscape entirely unique in world letters, a chronicle of the images from life and fiction that have endured and mingled in the author&#39;s mind, as well as the details (and details within details) that they contain. As interested, if not more so, in the characters from his books-finished or unfinished-as with the members of his family or his daily life, the narrator lays bare the act of writing and imagining, finally giving us a glimpse of the mythical place where the characters of fiction dwell before they come into existence in books. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the spirit of Italo Calvino and Georges Perec, &lt;em&gt;Barley Patch&lt;/em&gt; is like no other fiction being written today." />
