  <title>A Remarkable Kindness - Diana Bletter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Through a largely hidden ceremony&amp;#8230;four friends discover the true meaning of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 2006 in a seaside village in Israel, where a war is brewing. Lauren, Emily, Aviva and Rachel, four memorable women from different backgrounds, are drawn to the village. Lauren, a maternity nurse, loves her Israeli doctor husband but struggles to make a home for herself in a foreign land miles away from her beloved Boston. Seeking a fresh start after divorce, her vivacious friend Emily follows. Strong, sensuous Aviva, brought to Israel years earlier by intelligence work, has raised a family and now lost a son. And Rachel, a beautiful, idealistic college graduate from Wyoming, arrives with her hopeful dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women forge a friendship that sustains them as they come to terms with love and loss, and the outbreak of war. Their intimate bond is strengthened by their participation in a traditional ritual that closes the circle of life. As their lives are slowly transformed, each finds unexpected strength and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brimming with wisdom, rich in meaningful insights, &lt;em&gt;A Remarkable Kindness&lt;/em&gt; is a moving testament to women&amp;#8217;s friendship, illuminating a mostly unknown ritual that underscores what it means to truly be alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
