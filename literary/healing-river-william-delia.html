  <title>Healing River - William Delia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Luther Cranstons cancer miraculously disappears after being baptized in the Jericho River, his healing brings hope to some and conflict and controversy to others. Somelike a young father paralyzed by a stroke, a terminally ill woman of faith, and a nine-year-old boy who suffers life-threatening seizureswonder, Do the healing waters of the Jericho hold a miracle for me? Otherslike a local newspaper editor and the pastor who baptized Lutherquestion if this healing is to be believed, especially when a prominent televangelist tries to capitalize on Luthers miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, they realize that all of us are in need of some form of healing. As Pastor J. C. Hale tells them, Some of us are broken and in need of healing. Some of us are empty and looking to be filled. Some of us are lost and hoping to be found. Some of us are burdened down and looking for relief. Some of us are hopeless and longing for some reason, any reason, to carry on. Some of us are questioning and looking for answers. Some of us believe but have doubts. Some of us do not believe and doubt that we ever will. Some of us need to forgive, and some of us need to be forgiven. But all of usall of usneed to know that we are loved by God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
