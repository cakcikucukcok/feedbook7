  <title>The Comfort of Our Kind - Tom Stoner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Situated between two mountain ridges, the New England town of Franklin Notch celebrates its history and the characters who have forged it. The cornerstone of its heritage is Talbert&#39;s Treaty, an eighteenth-century agreement between the original settlers and the Sagaweh Indian nation---as discovered by local historian Wes Moffatt, ex-host of a regionally famous kiddie TV show. &lt;i&gt;The Comfort of Our Kind&lt;/i&gt; is narrated by Daniel &quot;Boone&quot; Moffatt, Wes&#39;s oldest son and local chief of police, who describes life with his sister, Veronica, a misanthropic nurse with a weakness for Xanax; his brother, Reggie, a disgraced sportscaster who has been living undetected in Cinderella&#39;s Castle; his mother, a mystic ex-nun (who everyone still calls &quot;Sister&quot;); and his father, who has just been accused of inventing bad history by concocting Talbert&#39;s Treaty and most of the local lore.&lt;br&gt;As children, Boone, Veronica, and Reggie were trained by their mother&#39;s puzzling bedtime stories to serve in God&#39;s Army of Saints and &quot;fight for Goodness on earth.&quot; Now, as adults, they search for their gifts of Faith, Hope, and Grace in a parade of life-altering adventures while struggling with the presence of evil in the world. Along the way, they collide with a collection of characters, including a serial killer, a Zenlike naturalist doctor, a genius Mafia princess, phony Native Americans, and the Devil himself in various incarnations of human vanity. Against the deadline of Wes and Sister&#39;s fiftieth wedding anniversary and Boone&#39;s apocalyptic seventh visit from the Devil, the Moffatt family struggles to unite as a force of goodness and to reclaim the respect of their neighbors and friends.&lt;br&gt;Reminiscent of &lt;i&gt;Lake Wobegon Days&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Witches of Eastwick,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Comfort of Our Kind&lt;/i&gt; is an unpredictable, quirky tale in which each character&#39;s spirituality is tested in the overlay between earthy mysticism and raucous fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;The Comfort of Our Kind&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This fun debut novel by story writer Stoner chronicles the tribulations of a family caught in a war between good and evil in Franklin Notch, N.H.
