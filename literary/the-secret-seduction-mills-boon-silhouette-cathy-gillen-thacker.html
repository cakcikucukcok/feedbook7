  <title>The Secret Seduction (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Cathy Gillen Thacker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Lily Madsen promised herself that she would never again live up to her reputation as the &#39;Ice Princess&#39; of Holly Springs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To prove it, she&#39;s got a list of goals that are decidedly un-prissy– not to mention a certain bet Lily&#39;s made with some of her friends that says this virgin can seduce a visiting TV star who&#39;s in town for only a week. All Lily needs is a little help from her friend Fletcher Hart who just happens to be an animal consultant for the TV show. She needs him to get her on the set.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fletcher will be damned if he&#39;s going to let Lily throw herself at some Hollywood heavy– even if it means placing a wager of his own. The bet? That he can steer Lily away from the arrogant TV star and straight into his arms!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But every wager comes with a price. The question is, are Lily and Fletcher prepared for the consequences?&lt;/p&gt;
