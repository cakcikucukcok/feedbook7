  <title>And Gazelles Leaping - Sudhin N. Ghose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An orphan, his pet, a Manipuri elephant sensitive about his small size, and their friends&amp;mdash;Heera and her nanny-goat; Mazdoor and his donkey White Beauty; Tu Fan, a Chinese boy, and Soetomo from Java&amp;mdash;attend Sister&amp;rsquo;s Svenska&amp;rsquo;s kindergarten on an abandoned estate in rural Calcutta. The children and their pets live an idyllic life: they have many adventures on the estate, and are loved, sheltered and guided by Sister Svenska; Karin, the Sister&amp;rsquo;s help; Moti-Didi the washerwoman; and Cha-Cha the wheelwright.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when a rapacious corporation from the big city swoops in to take over their school, and a gang of juvenile thugs threatens the orphan and his elephant, he must band together with his friends&amp;mdash;with a little help and advice from the grown-ups around them&amp;mdash;and do battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A delightful fable about the innocent pleasures of childhood, and the evils of the world which forever threaten to mar it,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;And Gazelles Leaping&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;was first published in 1949. This is the first in Sudhin Ghose&amp;rsquo;s quartet which follows the young boy as he grows from a wide-eyed child into a disillusioned adult. Long-neglected classics, these novels are being reissued for the first time in more than half a century.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
