          &lt;strong&gt;Shattered by the CEO &lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Emilie Rose &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CEO Rand Kincaid had to rehire Tara Anthony as his assistant to comply with his father’s will. It was either get along with the one woman who’d dared to leave him first, or lose his family empire. But before Tara would accept, she wanted a second chance, with Rand back in her home and bed as her lover.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Boss’s Demand &lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Jennifer Lewis &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Powerful oil tycoon Elan Al Mansur knew Sara Daly, his new assistant, with her lush curves and alluring scent, would prove a distraction and, one night in the desert, he gave into his desires, seducing his secretary. Some months later, she revealed she was carrying his baby. But would she agree to her boss’s demand that she become his wife?&lt;/p&gt;
