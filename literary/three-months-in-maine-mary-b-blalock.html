  <title>Three Months in Maine - Mary B. Blalock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Back in Tuscaloosa County, nobody could hold a candle to Grandpa, and in Dale Doogans eyes, nobody ever would. But lately, Dale isnt so sure that he deserves the respected family name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since puberty, Dale has harbored a passion for older ladies, and on more than one occasion, has reaped the benefits of neglected, lonely housewives. After years of sexual misconduct, he is faced with the consequences of his actions, and distraught and guilt-ridden, he leaves his Alabama home in search of redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the dead of winter, he moves to Bugle Island, Maine, and within weeks, finds himself intrigued by his neighbor, Charley, a senior lady by any standards, and the two are soon fast friends. But that comes as no surprise to Dale, given his past reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charley has a roommate, Stella, and although Dale spends almost every waking moment in their apartment, the other woman continues to remain unseen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bouncing from the happenings in Maine to reminiscing into his past, Dale searches his soul to become the man his grandpa raised him to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tale of sexual awareness, accountability, and friendship.&lt;/p&gt;" />
