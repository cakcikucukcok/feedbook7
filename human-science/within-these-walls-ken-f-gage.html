      <meta name="description" content="After reading this book, you&#39;ll be able to walk in the shoes of some of Alaska&#39;s most infamous killers and you&#39;ll see the things they saw during their brutal, heinous acts.
     By interviewing and living with these killers, I&#39;ve been able to walk their bloody trail and listen to their victim&#39;s screams. You as a reader can now search for what most police departments are too overwhelmed to notice: the patterns. You&#39;ll learn to look beyond the background noise of everyday crimes, of routine blood-shed and begin to see the hot spots. When you live each day with these killers, you begin to see them re-live their gruesome crimes within their own mind; this is what makes the difference between a man convicted of murder and a true murderer." />
