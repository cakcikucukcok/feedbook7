  <title>T H E   R E a C H - Robert Milton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this, his third novel, Dr. Milton endeavors to make the titles possessed by all women?Maiden, Mother, Crone?discernible. His story concerns a triad of tensile lives, a trinity of goddesses dipped from the same hot, whorled gene pool but forged by distinctly different environments. The result is a cautionary tale replete with psychological, sociological and mystical insights related to child abuse, cancer and clairvoyance. &lt;br&gt;The Maiden?precocious and obviously neglected?provides the storytellers voice. Thwarted in her attempts to gain care and affection, her abuse is reported with momentous consequences. &lt;br&gt;When Llyn?the Mother?is told by two different Oncology experts We have nothing more to offer, she retreats to a childhood belief: High, Mountains are mystical, magical and healing. &lt;br&gt;In the background a fanatical Crone cruelly and sadistically cajoles from an unassailable position. &lt;br&gt;On the journey to the summit of the highest mountain in North America?Alaskas mighty Mt Denali?extraordinary triumphs, dreadful disasters and intense meditations on mortality are revealed. Throughout the story, explanations are disclosed, which ache with a wisdom that can only be understood by those who have been there and earned the right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Robert Milton is a graduate of the University of Southern Californias Clinical Psychology program. He has authored six books including three novels available on Amazon.com &lt;br&gt;While his world travels and interests reveal a kaleidoscope of themes, his curiosity recently led him to neuro-science and religion, particularly mysticism, which is touched upon in this novel and his recent non-fiction book Your FLEXXIBLE Brain published last year. Currently he lives in Southern California with his dog, an Ozzy Shepherd, named Mr. Dugan. He can be contacted at www.robertmiltonphd.com" />
