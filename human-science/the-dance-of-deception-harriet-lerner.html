  <title>The Dance of Deception - Harriet Lerner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Dance of Deception&lt;/em&gt;was published, Lerner discovered that women were not eager to identify with the subject. &quot;Well, I don&#39;t do deception&quot; was a common resonse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all &quot;do deception&quot;, often with the intention to protect ourselves and the relationships we depend on. &lt;em&gt;The Dance of Deception&lt;/em&gt;unravels the ways (and whys) that women show the false and hide the real -- even to our own selves. We see how relationships are affected by lying and faking, by silence and pretending and by brave -- but misguided -- efforts to tell the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truth-telling is at the heart of what is most central in women&#39;s lives. It is at the foundation of authenticity and creativity, intimacy and joy. Yet in the name of &quot;honesty&quot;, we can bludgeon each other. We can approach a difficult issue with such a poor sense of timing and tact that we can actually shut down the lines of communication rather than widening the path of truth-telling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes Lerner&#39;s advice takes a surprising turn -- for example, when she asks us to engage in a bold act of pretending in order to discover something &quot;more real&quot;; or when she tells us not to parachute down on our family to bring up a &quot;hot issue&quot; without laying the necessary groundwork first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the subject is affairs, family secrets, sexual faking or the challenge of &quot;being oneself&quot;, Lerner helps us to discover, speak and live our own truths.&lt;/p&gt;" />
