  <title>Entanglement: a True Story - Claire Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;If you think having the devil snapping at your heels is scary, its nothing compared to finding Gods calm presence at your back every time you stop to draw breath in your race to escapeparticularly for a determined agnostic like Claire. Indeed, His presence is so unnerving and unwelcome that its not until her world crumbles to ashes that she fi nds the courage to stop running and turn toward Him. Moderately psychic and a most earthbound mystic, Claire has heard the voice of Thomas from the days of earliest childhood, but has worked tirelessly for most of her adult life to shut it out or shout it downuntil she made that fateful decision.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Entanglement is the result of that choice. It describes the pain of surviving the traumatic deaths of four beloved people, fi nding the courage to walk away from abuse and oppression, and facing the fear of being utterly alone in the world. It also explains how confronting fear, accepting loss, and embracing the unknown and the mystical can create a life of enormous joy and enrichment. It focuses on how having the courage to stay in the not-knowing can be gloriously life-affirming and on how human life on earth is vastly more mysterious than most of us dare to imagine.&lt;/P&gt;" />
