  <title>Love Life - Cinique Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is full of uncertainties, failures, disappointments  its loaded with pain, grief and injustice.  People mosey around this earth alone, afraid, and desperately in need of affection.  All of our problems are directly related to our interpretation and application of our greatest single emotionlove.   Love Life was written as an inspirational guide, simply to encourage people to live their lives in love.  Love is more than an emotion; it is a way of life.  
This book is written in an essay form, with 16 different but relative subjects.  This book takes each subject and teaches love principals that will allow people to live victoriously in life no matter who they are.  From ages sixteen to one hundred, single or married, this book is for everyone - because everyone is capable of loving someone beyond them selves." />
