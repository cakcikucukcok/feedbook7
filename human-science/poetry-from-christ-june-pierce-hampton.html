  <title>Poetry from Christ - June Pierce Hampton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The poems are from GOD, using June Pierce-Hampton as the messenger. It is so amazing, once the title for the poem was established; the words flowed from GODs spirit through her spirit onto paper. June was amazed after writing the poetry of the effect it had on her and others she read them to. After writing the poems, she decided to try and reference the poems with the Kings James Version of the Bible; they all were there! Every poem could be related to a Book, Chapter and Verse. In some cases, there were more than one or two scriptures that corresponded to some of the poems. This is GOD sent, GOD given and received for GODs proposes! The poetry in this book is for uplifting and giving one hope, security and happiness by believing and trusting in our CREATOR, and HIS SON, JESUS. Thus, June decided to name the manuscript POETRY FROM CHRIST.&lt;/p&gt;" />
