  <title>A Different Approach to Phonics - Trudy Witham, Sharon Clonts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Letter Itself Becomes the Tutor
To firmly establish the sound of the letters of the alphabet in the mind of your child, we created and instituted a completely new and unusual approach.  In the A Different Approach  to Phonics the letter itself becomes the tutor and the tool for learning the sound made by the letter.   Your child should never again be able to look at a letter in the alphabet without assessing it as a means of verbally communicating sound.
A Different Approach  is very helpful for little ones, but it has also been shown to be very effective with the more mature student: and that can mean from 8 on until adulthood wherein the student has not been able to approach reading because of varying learning disabilities such as dyslexia.  A Different Approach is a wonder reading program for all ages.

After your child sees this style to phonics, he or she should never again be able to look at a letter in the alphabet without assessing it as a means of verbally communicating sound. 
It is so unique that it will be functional to those more mature students of reading who for various reasons find themselves needing to learn the various sounds which make up learning to read. 
A New Approach can act as a supplement to clarify and validate within the mind of your child that each letter has its own distinctive sound." />
