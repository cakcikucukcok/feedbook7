  <title>My Brother Daniel - Jenny Berger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A heart-warming story about a little boy coming to terms with his brother&#39;s autism.
My son Daniel flaps and spins and shouts. He makes unpredictable movements with strange and disarming noises. But once you know him his strangeness is not so apparent. He is sweet and gentle and he loves to laugh. I have watched my other children try to explain this to people we meet. My youngest son would run up to kids in the park and say This is my Brother, Daniel and he is okay, he just cant talk. As a four-year old he didnt want people to judge Daniel as weird or rude. He wanted them to understand. Having a child that is so obviously different can be a very isolating experience. I am heartened by my children&#39;s attempt to help others appreciate Daniel and I felt the need to do the same through this little book." />
