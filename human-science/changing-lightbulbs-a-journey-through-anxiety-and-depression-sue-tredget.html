  <title>Changing Lightbulbs: A journey through anxiety and depression - Sue Tredget</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Changing Lightbulbs Sue Tredget has written a heart-warming, inspiring, and deeply personal account of her journey through anxiety and depression, from darkness to light. With humour, wit and candour, and by telling us not &amp;lsquo;how-to&amp;rsquo; but &amp;lsquo;how-I-did&amp;rsquo;, Sue provides insight into these very common mental health conditions. Changing Lightbulbs shows that we are never alone and breaks through the silence and shame in which stigma flourishes. The honesty of Sue&amp;rsquo;s powerful and uplifting story shines through in every part of the narrative; this is a book filled with hope that should help anyone going through a tough time to reach out rather than suffer in silence, and encourage us all to treat anyone suffering from depression or anxiety with kindness, respect, acceptance and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;" />
