  <title>Tradition v. Rationalism - Eugene Callahan, Lee Trepanier, Ferenc Hörcher, Colin Cordner...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span style=&quot;tab-stops:left 28pt left 56pt left 84pt left 112pt left 140pt left 168pt left 196pt left 224pt left 252pt left 280pt left 308pt left 336pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the first half of the twentieth century, the rationalist tide had reached its high mark in the arts, politics, and work. But the Holocaust, the Gulag, and other failures have dimmed the popularity of rationalism. However, the evidence of those practical failures would not have been as convincing as it was if not for the existence of a theoretical diagnosis of the malady. This book compares and contrasts the ideas of some of the leading twentieth-century critics of rationalism: Hans-Georg Gadamer, F.A. Hayek, Aurel Kolnai, Alasdair MacIntyre, Michael Oakeshott, Michael Polanyi, Gilbert Ryle, Eric Voegelin, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. While each can be seen as a critic of rationalism, were they each attacking the same thing? In what senses did their analyses overlap, and in what senses did they differ? Clarifying these issues, this book will provide important insights into this major intellectual trend of the past century.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;tab-stops:left 28pt left 56pt left 84pt left 112pt left 140pt left 168pt left 196pt left 224pt left 252pt left 280pt left 308pt left 336pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;By including these major thinkers, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Tradition v. Rationalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, we see that that these thinkers believed that tradition should still have a place in the world as a repository of wisdom. As our lives becomes increasingly dominated by various forms of rationalities&amp;mdash;whether political, technological, economic, or cultural&amp;mdash;we need to ask ourselves whether this is the type of world in which we want to live; and if not, how can we critique and propose an alternative to it? The thinkers in this book provide us a starting point on our journey towards thinking about how we can have a more hopeful, humane, and brighter future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
