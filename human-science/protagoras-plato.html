  <title>Protagoras - Plato</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Protagoras, like several of the Dialogues of Plato, is put into the mouth of Socrates, who describes a conversation which had taken place between himself and the great Sophist at the house of Callias&amp;mdash;&amp;#39;the man who had spent more upon the Sophists than all the rest of the world&amp;#39;&amp;mdash;and in which the learned Hippias and the grammarian Prodicus had also shared, as well as Alcibiades and Critias, both of whom said a few words&amp;mdash;in the presence of a distinguished company consisting of disciples of Protagoras and of leading Athenians belonging to the Socratic circle. The dialogue commences with a request on the part of Hippocrates that Socrates would introduce him to the celebrated teacher. He has come before the dawn had risen&amp;mdash;so fervid is his zeal. Socrates moderates his excitement and advises him to find out &amp;#39;what Protagoras will make of him,&amp;#39; before he becomes his pupil.&lt;br /&gt;
They go together to the house of Callias; and Socrates, after explaining the purpose of their visit to Protagoras, asks the question, &amp;#39;What he will make of Hippocrates.&amp;#39; Protagoras answers, &amp;#39;That he will make him a better and a wiser man.&amp;#39; &amp;#39;But in what will he be better?&amp;#39;&amp;mdash;Socrates desires to have a more precise answer. Protagoras replies, &amp;#39;That he will teach him prudence in affairs private and public; in short, the science or knowledge of human life.&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
This, as Socrates admits, is a noble profession; but he is or rather would have been doubtful, whether such knowledge can be taught, if Protagoras had not assured him of the fact, for two reasons: (1) Because the Athenian people, who recognize in their assemblies the distinction between the skilled and the unskilled in the arts, do not distinguish between the trained politician and the untrained; (2) Because the wisest and best Athenian citizens do not teach their sons political virtue. Will Protagoras answer these objections?" />
