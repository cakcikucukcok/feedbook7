  <title>Hannah Arendt, Totalitarianism, and the Social Sciences - Peter Baehr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book examines the nature of totalitarianism as interpreted by some of the finest minds of the twentieth century. It focuses on Hannah Arendt&#39;s claim that totalitarianism was an entirely unprecedented regime and that the social sciences had integrally misconstrued it. A sociologist who is a critical admirer of Arendt, Baehr looks sympathetically at Arendt&#39;s objections to social science and shows that her complaints were in many respects justified. 
Avoiding broad disciplinary endorsements or dismissals, Baehr reconstructs the theoretical and political stakes of Arendt&#39;s encounters with prominent social scientists such as David Riesman, Raymond Aron, and Jules Monnerot. In presenting the first systematic appraisal of Arendt&#39;s critique of the social sciences, Baehr examines what it means to see an event as unprecedented.  Furthermore, he adapts Arendt and Aron&#39;s philosophies to shed light on modern Islamist terrorism and to ask whether it should be categorized alongside Stalinism and National Socialism as totalitarian." />
