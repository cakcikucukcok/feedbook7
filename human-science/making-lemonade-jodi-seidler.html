  <title>Making Lemonade - Jodi Seidler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Making Lemonade  A Guidebook for Life After Divorce.    By Jodi Seidler
&lt;br&gt;
This Guidebook dissects, explores and gleans the experiences out of 15 years of single parenting; weaving them into 88 pages of insights, wit, prose and hard core facts. Its a quick study manual for all single parents starting a new life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
Nothing was worse than not getting asked to prom.  And then you had to deal with the bar circuit and dating in your 20s.  Then, your 30s roll around and you wonder why you are still single when you are finally secure with who you are.  And then, you get married and have children, and your Prince Charming turns out not to be so charming after 10 years of marriage, so you depart with the pumpkin.  And now you are in your 40s, and back on the dating circuit, teenage child in tow.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
How do you not just survive, but prosper as a single parent and also prove (to yourself) youre still a catch in todays market?  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When we first realize we are on our own, life can feel surreal. Maybe we got used to someone else pumping our gas, cooking our meals, paying our bills, cleaning our house. Perhaps we could not wait to leave the relationship, but no one told us the challenges and feelings we would be experiencing. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We ask ourselves - whose life is this anyway? Well - turns out its your NEW life, and its time to buckle your seat belt and experience YOUR new life head on! 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Jodi Seidler shares tips, tidbits, prose and inspiration on what its like to be a(divorced) single parent in todays world. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Jodi is The Mother of Re-Invention and Founder of the internets first single parenting site back in 1997 - www.makinglemonade.com - The Single Parent Network; and Creator of the whimsical HIP community - www.hipsterclub.com for people who have had a hip replacement." />
