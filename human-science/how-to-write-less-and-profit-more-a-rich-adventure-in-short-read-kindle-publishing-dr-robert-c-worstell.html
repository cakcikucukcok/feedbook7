  <title>How to Write Less and Profit More - A Rich Adventure In Short Read Kindle Publishing - Dr. Robert C. Worstell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;Hidden in the book you&amp;#39;re writing right now is a way to get more royalties.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Deep in the heart of the ever-growing Amazon Kindle jungle, there&amp;#39;s a profitable underserved market which is not easily discovered. It sits in a clearing by itself, much like a massive stone temple rising above the forest. ...A temple with some gold-filled rooms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We saw such an expedition hinted at by another well-known writer who began to pull down 6-figure income over the last couple of years with his non-fiction short books. But he never really explored the opportunities this area has. In carefully re-tracing his path, it showed me the turns he didn&amp;#39;t take.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That inspired me to start my own journey around two months ago. I&amp;#39;m currently publishing an average of one short read ebook per week. And the results are promising, even at this early stage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This path struck my fancy, as it told more about how to really use short reads as a business strategy. How to cement those 6-figures that writer started seeing. What I&amp;#39;ve discovered accelerates that progress, perhaps even creating your 7-figure income - from the same amount of writing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&amp;#39;s a growing group of readers which Amazon has been catering to with their Kindle Short Reads.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They are called CBR&amp;rsquo;s - coffee break readers. They&amp;rsquo;re not just people who have never read longer books before... They&amp;rsquo;re anyone who has limited time to read for whatever reason. Their commute, their lunch break, while waiting at airports...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These people aren&amp;#39;t stuck into a certain author, it&amp;#39;s more like the certain type of entertainment they want: short stories which they can read in their available time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The simple idea is that you can spend two months writing and editing an 80,000 word book and sell it for 4.99 on Kindle.&lt;br /&gt;
Or - you could publish eight 10,000 word books and publish them for 2.99, then come right back to offer the box set for 4.99.&lt;br /&gt;
Which approach would make you more royalties?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you use your books to generate email subscribers, which approach would generate more leads?&lt;br /&gt;
How about value? Which would you rather buy - one book at 4.99 or a box set of 8 books for 4.99?&lt;br /&gt;
But you&amp;#39;ve written the same amount of text in both cases, spent roughly the same amount of time writing (although more on covers and descriptions) for possibly four times the royalties...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And then there&amp;#39;s the point that there are far fewer books in these categories - particularly since the &amp;quot;&amp;quot;conventional wisdom&amp;quot;&amp;quot; says that longer books sell more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a sideways review of Geoff Shaw&amp;#39;s Udemy Course on Short Read Publishing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also included are four specific (ninja) marketing tactics that short read authors can do that regular long-form authors can&amp;#39;t easily accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, if your book is written well (or if you want to edit it into this shape) any bigger book could possibly be turned into short reads. (These are called &amp;quot;&amp;quot;serials&amp;quot;&amp;quot;.) But those habits are not easily changed. Certainly, this isn&amp;#39;t being widely encouraged by the Big 5 Publishers or conventional wisdom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book itself is a test of this short read publishing system. It is being published as not just an ebook, but also a long-form blog post, a podcast, and two paperback formats. I cover inside how to use these multiple formats to further increase your royalties and book discovery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The kicker is that this book was a three-day turnaround from starting to published works. (Or I could have sent it off for more proofing and written two more short reads while waiting for it to return.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Would you like to make more income for the same amount of writing?&lt;br /&gt;
