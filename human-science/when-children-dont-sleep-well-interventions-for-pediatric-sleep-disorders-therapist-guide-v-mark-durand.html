  <title>When Children Dont Sleep Well: Interventions for Pediatric Sleep Disorders Therapist Guide - V. Mark Durand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many children experience sleep problems and their parents often seek help for what can be a nightly disruption to the entire family. Difficulty getting a good nights sleep can also impact a childs functioning during the day. In addition, sleep problems often accompany and can contribute to other disorders. Despite common belief, children do not simply grow out of most sleep problems. While medications are often prescribed, they may have serious side-effects and have not been proven effective in children. However, there is more than twenty years of psychological research supporting non-pharmacological interventions for childrens sleep problems.  This comprehensive guide provides intervention options for a wide variety of sleep problems, including bedtime disturbances, night waking, sleep terrors, and nightmares. It also addresses sleep hygiene, bedwetting, and other sleep-related issues. It uses a modular format, starting with a thorough assessment of the childs sleep problems and the familys ability to intervene. Each intervention module outlines how to instruct families in selecting an intervention and carrying it out successfully. A companion workbook for parents includes detailed steps for intervention, as well as recording forms for sleep and behavior.  Used as a stand-alone management program for pediatric sleep problems or as part of treatment for other childhood disorders, this guide is an essential resource for clinicians." />
