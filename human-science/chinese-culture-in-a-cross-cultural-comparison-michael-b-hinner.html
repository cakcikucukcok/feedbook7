This eighth volume of the &lt;I&gt;Freiberger Beiträge &lt;/I&gt;seeks to provide some essential insights into Chinese culture to help improve transactions and relationships with Chinese stakeholders. The contributing authors help explain the various facets of Chinese culture revolving around communication, business negotiations, and conflict management." />
