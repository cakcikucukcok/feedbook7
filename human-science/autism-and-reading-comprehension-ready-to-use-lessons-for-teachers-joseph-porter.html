  <title>Autism and Reading Comprehension: Ready-to-use Lessons for Teachers - Joseph Porter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The predictable format, repetition, and routine of these lessons will create a relaxed learning environment, while the variations in the topics will hold students attention and help them generalize the reading skills they need to succeed! Starting with Level 1 (The Cat) and ending with Level 9 (The Lizard), special-educator Joseph Porter has developed an amazing 90 hours of animal-themed, whole-group instructions. There are two student worksheets for each of nine animals, totaling eighteen worksheets. Each worksheet has four variations, and there is a ready-to-go lesson plan for each one! There are also two sentence-building exercises for each animal theme, which will build students observation skills and help them transform those skills into conversation and written language. In addition to the step-by-step lesson plans, Joseph provides a detailed description of what the lessons will look and feel like in the classroom, complete with valuable, first-hand advice. In the back, you&#39;ll find an appendix with numerous suggestions for complementary activities for each animal theme, so you can supplement on the days with art projects, music, books, and videos. There is even a section containing Data-Collection Sheets, assessment forms that will help you record students progress, per IEP standards. All of the worksheets, lesson plans, visual tools, and assessment forms are available for quick-and-easy print at www.fhautism.com/arc.html." />
