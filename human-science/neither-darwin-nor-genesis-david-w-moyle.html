  <title>Neither Darwin nor Genesis - David W. Moyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For over 150 years, a war of words has been fought between science and religion over which theory best describes life as we know it-Darwin&#39;s theory or the story as presented in the Christian Bible. In a bold new approach, &lt;i&gt;Neither Darwin Nor Genesis&lt;/i&gt; clearly outlines the major flaws in both arguments and offers a whole new view of life, creation, and evolution based on fundamentals of metaphysical science which looks beyond the physical, visible realms to uncover the invisible but intelligent forces which govern all things in form. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This New Paradigm of life comes as school leaders and our nation&#39;s courts are being besieged by the proponents of two old schools of thought try to establish their world view into the minds of our children. In one swoop, &lt;I&gt;Neither Darwin Nor Genesis&lt;/I&gt; shows clearly why neither of those theories hold water, and now offers one that does. As we move into new millennia with a world dangerously out of balance, the New Paradigm offers a worldview that has been known to aboriginal cultures for eons and concurrently is being accepted by quantum physicists and New Thought spiritualists. &lt;/P&gt;" />
