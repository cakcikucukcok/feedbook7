  <title>I, Mammal: How to Make Peace With the Animal Urge for Social Power - Loretta Graziano Breuning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mammals live in groups for protection from predators, but group life is frustrating. Higher-status individuals end up with better mating opportunity and foraging spots. Natural selection built a brain that rewards you with a good feeling when you gain social power. Serotonin is that good feeling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; The mammal brain releases a bit of serotonin each time you perceive a social advantage. But the serotonin is soon metabolized and it takes another social advantage to stimulate more. That&amp;#39;s why &amp;quot;junk status&amp;quot; gets people&amp;#39;s attention. This book shows you how to enjoy serotonin without the frustrations of endless power-seeking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Our appetite for status is as natural as our appetite for food and sex. You may say you&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;against status,&amp;rdquo; but if you filled a room with people who said that, a status hierarchy would soon form based on how hard each person insists. That&amp;rsquo;s what mammals do.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; When your urge for social power is disappointed, it feels like a survival threat to your mammal brain. You would never think this in words, but the mammal brain works with neurochemicals instead of words. Your neurochemical ups and downs make sense when you know how social power promotes survival in the animal world. Nothing is wrong with us. We are mammals. We work hard to restrain these urges, and we can celebrate how well we do with the mental equipment we&amp;rsquo;ve got instead of focusing on our flaws.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; The mammal brain evolved a way to manage social life. It constantly compares itself to others and releases stress chemicals when it needs to hold back to avoid conflict. It releases serotonin when it sees a way to forge ahead and meet its needs. We humans feel this dynamic constantly, which is why we have so many words for it: ego, competitiveness, pride, respect, one-upping, self-confidence. We can finally make sense of our hybrid brain thanks to an accumulation of research in animal science and neuroscience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; You can wire yourself to enjoy the good feeling of social power without being a &amp;ldquo;jerk.&amp;rdquo; When you understand your inner mammal, you can trigger serotonin without endless frustration. This book helps you retrain your brain to feel good about your social position without being a prisoner of &amp;ldquo;junk status.&amp;rdquo; What a relief!&lt;/p&gt;" />
