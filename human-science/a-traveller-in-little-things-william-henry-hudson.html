  <title>A Traveller in Little Things - William Henry Hudson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First published in 1921, &quot;A Traveller in Little Things&quot; is a charming travel narrative of the author&#39;s various rambles around the beautiful countryside of England. Highly recommended for all lovers of nature writing. William Henry Hudson (1841 - 1922) was an Argentinian naturalist, author, and ornithologist. He was one of the founding members of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and is best known for his novel &quot;Green Mansions&quot; (1904). Other notable works include &quot;A Little Boy Lost&quot; (1905) and &quot;Far Away and Long Ago&quot; (1918), which has since been adapted into a film. Hudson is considered a national treasure in Argentina, and his legacy lives on in the form of an Italian town and numerous other public places named after him. Contents include: &quot;How I Found My Title&quot;, &quot;The Old Man&#39;s Delusion&quot;, &quot;As A Tree Falls&quot;, &quot;A Story Of Long Descent&quot;, &quot;A Second Story Of Two Brothers&quot;, &quot;A Third Story Of Two Brothers&quot;, &quot;The Two White Houses: A Memory&quot;, &quot;Dandy A Story Of A Dog&quot;, &quot;The Samphire Gatherer&quot;, &quot;A Surrey Village&quot;, etc. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />
