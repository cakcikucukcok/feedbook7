  <title>The ‘Mystical’ Tcm Triple Energizer - Dr. Louis Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The mystery is solved! The actual location, composition, and morphology of the mysterious TCM triple energizer (San Jiao) organ will surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous recent scientific research findings confirm ancient TCM philosophy was eons ahead of its time. This book discusses newly discovered organ systems (Primo Vascular System, the gut microbiome, the omnipresent neuromyofascial metasystem, endocrine function of fat) and how they affect the Triple Energizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book elucidates the actual location, composition, and morphology of the Triple Energizer as expressed by modern scientific discovery, and evidence is presented to show how the Triple Energizer functions and why it has remained hidden all this time. Those who believe that the Triple Burner has a name but no form will be truly amazed as to its actual location and its actual form. Numerous other practical TCM concepts are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blastocyst grown on a petri dish in 1977 resulted in the very first IVF baby, Louise Brown. Commenting on the Nan Ching, Yeh Lin described the blastocyst when he said, It is the utensil that stores and transforms the essence, and it is the place to which the womb, which conceives the embryo, is tied. Thus, it is the origin of mans life. Hence, it is called gate of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commenting on Nan Ching, Y Shu said, The spleen takes in the five tastes. It transforms them to produce the five influences . . . and to make flesh and skin grow. Since about 2005, researchers have been astonished to find scent receptors and the five known taste sensors throughout the body smelling and tasting things deep inside of us. These taste and odor receptors have been found in the kidneys, stomach, intestines, pancreas, lungs, brain, spine, bladder, sinuses, muscle tissue, and even the anus. Bitter taste receptors have been found in sperm. Researchers believe these receptors are distributed throughout the entire vascular system. As the Heart controls the blood vessels in TCM, it makes perfect sense that the Heart masters the odors, exactly as ancient TCM scholars state.&lt;/p&gt;" />
