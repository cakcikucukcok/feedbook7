  <title>Groundwork for a Philosophy of Peace - Leon Kabasele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Groundwork for a Philosophy of Peace, readers will learn how human beings are capable of analyzing peace in the world. Readers will understand the meaning of politics according to the viewpoints of Aristotle and Immanuel Kant. This book is not for reading only; it is for developing ideas that human beings have been ignoring for many generations, during which time the world has existed in ignorance without a good plan for the future. The conflict started when human beings started to develop and multiply on earth, and expanded as they populated the entire world. The consciousness of human beings is based on living in harmony; but there are just few people who enjoy a better life in the world. More people become depressed in their own countries when their authorities do not provide them with the peace they need. On other hand, the population refuses to respect the principles of their authorities. Sometime the feelings are reciprocal; the citizens need to claim their rights, but the authorities feel the citizens are against them. Also the authorities want to solve the citizens problems, but the citizens feel that the authorities are not working for them. Many people will discover that Groundwork for a Philosophy of Peace is a new philosophy for peace. It is about thinking deeper about the situation and debating the matters that need to be resolved. When you finish reading this book, please read also: The Worlds Problems and Solutions: Diversity Issues Analysis: Dealing with Human Race, Human Rights, Philosophy, Scientific, Religious, and World Economic Issues." />
