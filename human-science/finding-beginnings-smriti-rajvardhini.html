  <title>Finding Beginnings - Smriti Rajvardhini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How many times have we lived in the moment that we are in? How many times have we really been with the person with whom we are sitting for a coffee or have really worked, while we sit at our office desks, or the music we are listening to, playing with our children and many more such moments. The instances are many, and heart in heart, we are all smiling now, because we know the answer, dont we?
This book, which is a continuation to part 1 (i.e., Stars Under My Feet, Journey Through Poems) is a tribute to most of those moments in which I chose to live fully. A tribute to all those moments when I came in terms with reality and accepted it. A tribute to all the amazing people who joined me to give me positive directions. 
Embarking on a new journey of hope, fight, survival, prayer, and acceptance is what this book is all about. My poems are compiled and tied together for each one us who itch to identify with themselves every day. Much love, truth, and hope to all." />
