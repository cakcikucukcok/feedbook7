  <title>The Meditations of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus - James Moore, Michael Silverthorne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;This 1742 translation is a collaborative work by Francis Hutcheson and a colleague at Glasgow University, the classicist James Moor. Although Hutcheson was secretive about the extent of his work on the book, he was clearly the leading spirit of the project.&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt; This influential classical work offered a vision of a universe governed by a natural law that obliges us to love mankind and to govern our lives in accordance with the natural order of things. In their account of the life of the emperor, prefaced to their translation from the Greek, Hutcheson and Moor celebrated the Stoic ideal of an orderly universe governed by a benevolent God. They contrasted the serenity recommended and practiced by Marcus Aurelius with the divisive sectarianism then exhibited by their fellow Presbyterians in Scotland and elsewhere. They urged their readers and fellow citizens to set aside their narrow prejudices.&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt; In many ways, Hutcheson and Moor&amp;#8217;s &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The Meditations of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a companion volume to Hutcheson&amp;#8217;s Latin work on ethics, released in the same year, &lt;EM&gt;Philosophiae Moralis Institutio Compendiaria.&lt;/EM&gt; In the latter volume, which is also available from Liberty Fund, Hutcheson continues a theme that proffered his ethics as a modern and, not least, Christianized version of Stoicism. &lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Knud Haakonssen&lt;/STRONG&gt; is Professor of Intellectual History and Director of the Centre for Intellectual History at the University of Sussex, England. &lt;/DIV&gt;" />
