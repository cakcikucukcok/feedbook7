  <title>Free to Run the Race: Undoing the Burdens of Parental Disregard - Gary Ventimiglia, Brad D. Strawn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Free to Run the Race describes the living out of our life in Christ (Hebrews 12:1). It speaks of running &quot;with endurance the race that is set before us.&quot; This can be done by fixing our &quot;eyes on Jesus.&quot; &quot;Undoing the Burden of Parental Disregard,&quot; speaks to a specific encumbrance that weighs the runner down making it harder to keep focus and finish the race. The burden is called &quot;parental disregard.&quot; It is not being allowed to &quot;be oneself,&quot; to pursue one&#39;s inner direction, or natural proclivity in one&#39;s life. It is the experience of developmental woundedness that says being oneself in temperament, aptitudes, natural talents, and the expressing of this is prohibited. Prov 22:6 says, &quot;train up a child according to his own way.&quot; The burden of parental disregard is the emotional pain in living out an identity that is not based on any expression of one&#39;s natural &quot;way(s)&quot; or bent(s). This makes the development of trust in a heavenly Father (parent) difficult. The relieving of this burden takes a ruthlessly honest focus on this woundedness and its working out its implications honestly that allows a more truthful understanding of God&#39;s love for our lives." />
