  <title>Niccolo Machiavelli&#39;s The Prince on The Art of Power: The New Illustrated Edition of the Renaissance Masterpiece on Leadership (The Art of Wisdom) - Niccolo Machiavelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The Prince&quot; is a political treatise by the Florentine public servant and political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli. Originally called De Principatibus (About Principalities), it was written in 1513, but not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli&#39;s death. The treatise is not representative of the work published during his lifetime, but it is the most remembered, and the work responsible for bringing &quot;Machiavellian&quot; into wide usage as a pejorative term. It has also been suggested by some critics that the piece is, in fact, a satire." />
