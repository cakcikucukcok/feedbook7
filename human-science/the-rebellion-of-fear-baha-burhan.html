  <title>The Rebellion of Fear - Baha Burhan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bahaa Burhan has collected his innermost thoughts in this inspiring volume, &lt;i&gt;The Rebellion of Fear.&lt;/i&gt; He lets us into his world as he wonders about such varied topics as what makes us cry and grandeur of ancient civilizations whose founders are long gone.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Castles shall remain eyewitnesses to the grandeur of
a civilization built on remnants of the victims
who had fallen while setting them up.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Some of the moments that he discusses are quite ironic:
&lt;i&gt;How come that we consider our disability strength pushing us to another disability we consider strength?&lt;/i&gt;
Burham has presented thoughts that will spur all to think creatively about the future and to maintain an optimism that enables Burham to look to his future for clarity of thought. 
&lt;i&gt;As fast as an escapee from death to life, we regain our consciousness, to realize that we are escapees from life to death; thereupon, we lose our consciousness again.&lt;/i&gt;
Examining the spiritual side of life presents an opportunity to examine Burhans philosophy while gaining a broader knowledge of what makes us tick." />
