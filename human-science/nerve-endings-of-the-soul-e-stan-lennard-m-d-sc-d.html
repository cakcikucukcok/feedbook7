  <title>Nerve Endings of the Soul - E. Stan Lennard M.D. Sc.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is a common belief that personal communion from the Holy Spirit to mankind ceased at the closure of the canon of scripture. The information presented in this book shows that interaction between the Holy Spirit and the mind of man enabled by the human spirit is bidirectional and continues in our time. Evidence presented from theological and scientific resources confirms the duality of the immaterial mind and the physical brain of man and substantiates the personal interaction between the Holy Spirit and the mind of human beings. The model for study is the neural synaptic network, incorporating the microsite hypothesis of Sir John C. Eccles. Dualist interaction has been substantiated by contemporary theologians and investigators in the neurosciences and information theory, building on advances in quantum wave theory. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A hypothesis is offered by this author for a mechanism for dualist interaction involving probabilistic quantum tunneling across synaptic clefts. Transmission of specified information with meaning and purpose occurs within neural codes in spike trains of action potentials in synaptic networks. Through a lifetime of learning archived in memory, the mind of humans interprets neural codes enabled by the unique capacity for language. Communication from the Holy Spirit, as sender, to human minds, as recipients, draws upon current understandings of information and communication theory. The trigger for initiating spike trains as codes is postulated as an immaterial energy source by which the Holy Spirit communicates with the mind of man. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Evidence presented in this book provides a compelling rationale for the reality of bidirectional communication with the living, personal Holy Spirit in our time. That Jesus Christ indwells those who accept his truth as a personal, living spirit is confirmation of the promise in John 14:1521. Interaction with God by his atoning grace through Jesus Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit gives receptive mankind comfort and counsel today to his glory.&lt;/p&gt;" />
