  <title>Writing What People Buy - Anne Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is for writing instructors and writers on 101 writing projects to write and sell or to create internships and externships and/or writing jobs or assignments and projects. What Will You Write?
&lt;p&gt;If you ever thought that you don&#39;t know what to write, you will now. And you will be able to research, write, revise, and sell to well-paying markets with these projects.
&lt;p&gt;Create Your Own Internships and Externships in Professional Writing: Projects to Do. Pick subjects for term papers, special studies or independent study courses, or commercial, high-paying book projects. 
&lt;p&gt;Write salable magazine articles. Freelance or create your own job or project. Create Your Own Internships and Externships in Professional Writing with these Projects to Do for Writers, Organizers, Researchers, Writing Students and Teachers from Middle School to Graduate Schools of Journalism, Creative Writing, New Media Studies and Communications, for MFA and PhD projects in Creative Fiction Writing, Journalism, Playwriting, Scriptwriting, and Creative Nonfiction.
&lt;p&gt;Familiarity sells in fiction. Give &#39;em the familiar because it sells big. Don&#39;t given &#39;em Crystal Pepsi when they expect classic Coca Cola to be brown. 
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the same Cinderella or Cinderfella story sells in ancient China or Egypt as it did in Europe in 1900 as it does today in Internet romances or virtual worlds avatars. So two points, 1) familiarity and 2) universal values always make best sellers in sagas, novels, multimedia books, and scripts or games." />
