  <title>Puzzled Isles of Spirit - T. K. Rosevear</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Puzzled Isles of Spirit:
My intentions, with these words, are to reach as many wandering souls, as possible, to achieve an energetic shift of consciousness, towards serious and mutually beneficial CHANGE. With the &quot;hope&quot; that the reader is able to tap into their &quot;SOURCE&quot;, of their own existence - with an open mind and a hunger for knowledge of the Universal Puzzle pieces and forming a personal belief and value system, based on information that &quot;Feels Good&quot; Living...
This guide is for people seeking more than what they have found, so far.
The more you learn, the more questions arise AND more POTENTIAL towards a purposeful, soulful existence.
These are simple tools for awakening our &quot;divinity&quot;, to manifest our destiny and touch others with the thoughts and actions that strengthen us, as a whole, with our differences accepted - sharing the purity of TRUTH - OUR SHARED STRENGTHS!
We begin with The isle of the Universe - Mother Earth; The isles of Movement and Time - Continental Alliance; Isles of History - Cultural Recordkeeping; Isles of Power - Balancing Power; Isles of Vision - &quot;R&quot;evolution; Isles of Consciousness- Unity of Consciousness; and, Isles of our Souls - Unity of Thought.
I hope readers will digest what feels and tastes good, assimilates what nourishes their soul and eliminates what does not feel right to them, with and about these words.
I am grateful for the recordkeepers of old and new, that gave me the inspiration to share these words to be windows, not walls...
