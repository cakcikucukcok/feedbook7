  <title>Piecing It Together - Martha Frimer Cheslow Ms Ccc-Slp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Speech-language pathologists are always rethinking their standards about what constitutes language and about their part in students academic and social success. But what has been lacking is a clearer, more orderly way to work with language- learning disorders. 
Building on decades of experience in the field, author Martha Frimer Cheslow presents just that in Piecing It Together. Designed for SLPs working with language-impaired children, this practical guide considers the abstract and sometimes puzzling world of language therapy. It focuses on teaching systematically in a clear and organized way and includes features such as valuable background information on each language area, fourteen language skills broken down into manageable objectives, and strategies that SLPs can use to guide themselves through individual goals.
an actionable, effective and customizable methodology for language disordered clients...the author presents a systematic approach to teaching the most basic components of a skill. She explains her methodology with laser-like precision as it pertains to skill areas such as pragmatic language skills, phonological awareness, expressive language skills, and many others. US Review of Books 
A reliable resource for therapists at all levels, this manual can be used in either special education or mainstream population environments. Piecing It Together provides therapists with methods for making good intervention choices and making therapy easier and more satisfying for their clientele and for themselves. 
The personal, compassionate touch to this manual is what makes it more humane, less technical, and more applicable in its sincerity. She manages to be informative without becoming preachy. Piecing It Together should be required reading for language therapists as well as traditional classroom teachers. Pacific Book Review" />
