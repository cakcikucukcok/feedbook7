  <title>Life in Idleness - Shane Callahan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is entitled Life in Idleness. So basically the book is on not wasting our time or our lives on things not serious or trying to make the reader think more about what he says and does in life so he can do things that are productive and not unproductive to himself or society. I wrote it with an aim to be more productive, and only be productive and not idle in our lives, or well get nowhere. 
If we do things in idleness while our lives stands still and make no gains in the world, time keeps creeping by without us noticing it, and we continue to get older and not realize that we have become unproductive in society. In the end, all we gain in life those that decides to live a life in idleness is time moving by while his or her life stands still being unproductive and useless to society. 
Thats the reason for the clock picture on the book. The book is telling people to do things that are only productive and meaningful in order for any country or society to gain from your existence. Not doing things that are meaningful or productive to society is a burden to a society because were all born to help each other and be productive and not be unproductive. We have to seek during our lifetime professions or jobs that helps every society to learn and to make every society better either by inventing things to make every persons life better or the like. The main chapter in the book though is my new terms in rhetoric." />
