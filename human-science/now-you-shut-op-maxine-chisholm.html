  <title>Now You Shut Op! - Maxine Chisholm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Now You Shut Op is a story about a two-year-old little boy who has very little vocabulary and doesnt like to be told what to do. Because he was named after his dad, he at the age of one year old didnt know he had a name. His mom thought that he was super smart for his age, so she decided to put him in Head Start. But to her surprise, he wasnt as ready as she thought. He started wetting on himself after he had to use a different bathroom from what he was use to using at home.
For the summer, his mother decided to take a road trip down South to visit her relatives and so they can see her precious little two-year-old. But he wasnt as excited as she had hoped he would be and didnt like to be told what to do by her family, and whenever they said anything to him, he would tell them to shut op. He couldnt even say shut up but rather shut op. He became very excited when he saw his mothers aunt, Aunt Queenie. He had mistaken her for his favorite character." />
