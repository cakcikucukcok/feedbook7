  <title>Working with Grieving and Traumatized Children and Adolescents - William Steele, Caelan Kuban</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Working With Grieving and Traumatized Children and Adolescents&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;This much-needed book effectively argues for the use of structured activities as the basis for exploring trauma-specific questions in clinical work with traumatized children and adolescents. Numerous examples of children&#39;s artwork enhance the book and illustrate the effectiveness of the treatment. The authors&#39; methods have been used successfully for many years and represent a major contribution to the study of trauma that will be welcomed by both students and seasoned practitioners.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;—Nancy Boyd Webb, DSW, LICSW, RPT-S&lt;/b&gt; Professor of Social Work Emerita, Fordham University, Author: &lt;i&gt;Play Therapy With Children in Crisis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;The authors provide a clear theoretical framework &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; demonstrate practical sensory-based activities so kids can discover and reconnect with their bodies&#39; agency and vitality. Refreshingly, this vehicle creates an emotionally safe journey for the child into the mystery of the experiential, embedded in implicit memory. It&#39;s chock-full of invitations to explore self-impressions and worldviews in a way that children feel seen, not assessed.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; —Peter A.
