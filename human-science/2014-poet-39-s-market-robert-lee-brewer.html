  <title>2014 Poet&#39;s Market - Robert Lee Brewer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h2&gt;The most trusted guide to getting poetry published!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;2014 Poet&#39;s Market&lt;/i&gt; includes hundreds of publishing opportunities specifically for poets, including listings for book/chapbook publishers, poetry publications, contests, and more. These listings include contact information, submission preferences, insider tips on what specific editors want, and--when offered--payment information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to the listings, &lt;i&gt;Poet&#39;s Market&lt;/i&gt; offers articles on the Craft of Poetry, Business of Poetry, and Promotion of Poetry--not to mention new poems from contemporary poets. Learn how to navigate the social media landscape, submit your poems for publication, write various poetic forms, give a perfect reading, and more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You also gain access to:&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Lists of conferences, workshops, organizations, and grants.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;One-year access to the poetry-related information and listings on WritersMarket.com (print edition only)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A free digital download of Writer&#39;s Yearbook featuring the 100 Best Markets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; Includes brand-new poems from today&#39;s best and brightest poets, including Amorak Huey, J.P. Dancing Bear, Jeannine Hall Gailey, Scott Owens, Martha Silano, Susan Rich, and more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;My grandmother bought my first &lt;i&gt;Poet&#39;s Market&lt;/i&gt; when I was in college. I had just taken my first college creative writing class. Now, nearly 20 years later, as a writer who has had books published and as an editor of a 10-year-old magazine, &lt;i&gt;Poet&#39;s Market&lt;/i&gt; is still an invaluable tool. Every poet and poetry student needs a copy on his or her bookshelf.&quot; --&lt;b&gt;Shaindel Beers&lt;/b&gt;, author of &lt;i&gt;A Brief History of Time&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Children&#39;s War and Other Poems&lt;/i&gt;, and Poetry Editor of &lt;i&gt;Contrary&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
