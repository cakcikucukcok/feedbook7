  <title>The Limitations of God - Ted Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the beginning, there was God. This is the starting point for all else that you will explore. This simple sentence is the most powerful definition for who, where, when, why, and how. This is a journey that takes you through all the vantage points of life and existence. This forbidden territory is a place where we look at creation and the by-products and merge an explanation via science, the supernatural, and humanity. The dogma on either side of this age-old debate between science and scripture is addressed and possibly resolved.
The aforementioned encapsulates what you will read, while stimulating deep emotion on a topic that churns with controversy and conflict. This is a book that will make you look at yourself and your personal convictions. As I discuss issues related to our self-worth and purpose, other doors are opened to questions yet answered. This book introduces both the creator and creation from the very beginning. You will find support for both.
For the believer, it will serve as a tool to strengthen and reinforce your conviction. For those who are not yet convinced that a creator exists, I offer evidence that illustrates life as a plan and not an accident. I have also incorporated into the book, several human-interest events all based on truth and real-life events. All things written, leading to the final reality that has a somewhat poetic ending. An ending that personally brings a sense of understanding and peace that is spiritually calming." />
