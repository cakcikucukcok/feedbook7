  <title>The Teen&#39;s Guide to Debating and Public Speaking - Claire Duffy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Everything students, parents, and teachers need to know about debating and public speaking.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Welcome to the world of school debating and public speaking, the best training ground for speaking, reasoning, arguing, and looking critically at big issues. No matter what the topic, a great deal is at stake. Speaking skills can open up a world of opportunities, from education to career development, activism, and political engagement. In an increasingly competitive world, being able to speak with confidence, passion, and persuasiveness has become essential to standing out from the crowd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Claire Duffy not only demystifies the process but makes it fun. Learn all about the best ways to prepare, the persuasive power of reason, the art of argument and rebuttal and, when worst comes to worst, how to “lose” graciously. Including practical tips from the pros and helpful step-by-step examples, this is the essential handbook for making every spoken word count." />
