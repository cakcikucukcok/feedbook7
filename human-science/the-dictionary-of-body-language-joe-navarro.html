  <title>The Dictionary of Body Language - Joe Navarro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the world&amp;#8217;s #1 body language expert* comes the essential book for decoding human behavior &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Navarro has spent a lifetime observing others. For 25 years, as a Special Agent for the FBI, he conducted and supervised interrogations of spies and other dangerous criminals, honing his mastery of nonverbal communication. After retiring from the bureau, he has become a sought-after public speaker and consultant, and an internationally bestselling author. Now, a decade after his groundbreaking book&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;What Every BODY is Saying&lt;/em&gt;, Navarro returns with his most ambitious work yet.&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Dictionary of Body Language&lt;/em&gt; is a pioneering &amp;#8220;field guide&amp;#8221; to nonverbal communication, describing and explaining the more than 400 behaviors that will allow you to gauge anyone&amp;#8217;s true intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving from the head down to the feet, Navarro reveals the hidden meanings behind the many conscious and subconscious things we do. Readers will learn how to tell a person&amp;#8217;s actual feelings from subtle changes in their pupils; the lip behaviors that betray concerns or hidden information; the many different varieties of arm posturing, and what each one means; how the position of our thumbs when we stand akimbo reflects our mental state; and many other fascinating insights to help you both read others and change their perceptions of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readers will turn to &lt;em&gt;The Dictionary Body Language&lt;/em&gt; again and again&amp;#8212;a body language bible for anyone looking to understand what their boss really means, interpret whether a potential romantic partner is interested or not, and learn how to put themselves forward in the most favorable light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*GlobalGurus.org&lt;/p&gt;" />
