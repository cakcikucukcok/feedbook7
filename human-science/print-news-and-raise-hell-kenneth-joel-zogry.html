  <title>Print News and Raise Hell - Kenneth Joel Zogry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For over 125 years, the &lt;i&gt;Daily Tar Heel&lt;/i&gt; has chronicled life at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and at times pushed and prodded the university community on issues of local, state, and national significance.  Thousands of students have served on its staff, many of whom have gone on to prominent careers in journalism and other influential fields. &lt;i&gt;Print News and Raise Hell&lt;/i&gt; engagingly narrates the story of the newspaper&#39;s development and the contributions of many of the people associated with it. Kenneth Joel Zogry shows how the paper has wrestled over the years with challenges to academic freedom, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press, while confronting issues such as the evolution of race, gender, and sexual equality on campus and long-standing concerns about the role of major athletics at an institution of higher learning. The story of the &lt;i&gt;Tar Heel&lt;/i&gt;, the social media platform of its day, uncovers many dramatic but perhaps forgotten events at UNC since the late nineteenth century, and along with many photographs and cartoons not published for decades, opens a fascinating window into Tar Heel history. Examining how the campus and the paper have dealt with many challenging issues for more than a century, Zogry reveals the ways in which the history of the &lt;i&gt;Daily Tar Heel&lt;/i&gt; is deeply intertwined with the past and present of the nation&#39;s oldest public university.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
