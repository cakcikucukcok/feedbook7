  <title>Transcendental Meditation with Questions and Answers - His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;#39;There is an ever-increasing state of chaos in the world; tension increases daily in the individual, in social life, in national affairs, and international relations. The great and urgent need is for something to re-establish harmony in the individual human being and to give him peace; only from such an inner peace can wisdom and happiness be born. All that we call wisdom today, all knowledge, the whole process of endless fact-gathering must utterly fail to satisfy the real needs of man; for these real needs are called happiness, understanding, and wisdom, and they are not vain and unworldly aspirations, but man&amp;rsquo;s birthright.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;I came out of the Himalayas with a method designed to raise both the head and the heart of man to the point where knowledge and appreciation of the quality of his higher nature can be attained. I call my method Transcendental Meditation, but it is, in fact, a technique of self-exploration; it enables a man to dive into the innermost reaches of his being, in which dwells the essence of life and the source of all wisdom, all creativity, all peace, and all happiness. It is that place which has been called in the Christian teaching, the &amp;ldquo;Kingdom of Heaven within&amp;rdquo;.&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
