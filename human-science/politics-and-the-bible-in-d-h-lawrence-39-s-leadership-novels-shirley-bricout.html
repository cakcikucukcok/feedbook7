  <title>Politics and the Bible in D.H. Lawrence&#39;s Leadership Novels - Shirley Bricout</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This   study, based on the numerous Bible references found in &lt;em&gt;Aaron’s   Rod&lt;/em&gt; (1922), &lt;em&gt;Kangaroo&lt;/em&gt; (1923) and &lt;em&gt;The Plumed Serpent&lt;/em&gt;  (1926), shows how the constant borrowings from Bible sources   voice D.  H. Lawrence’s political thought. In many ways, Lawrence’s   relation to  the Bible recalls Nietzsche’s, however his appropriation of   religious  rites and sacred texts aims at questioning the political role of   man  in a community in terms of power and submission while positioning man in    the cosmos. Still under the trauma of his war experience, Lawrence  introduces   characters who, mirroring his own despair, reject their  native country and   leave in search of a new political order. They  question their relation to   God, to homeland and to marital bonds,  intertextual dialogism voicing their   doubts. In exile, their  distancing from the power of the Word, which   represents European  political power, increases, as does the amount of   transformation the  biblical text undergoes. Eventually confronted with   ideologies such as  Fascism and Marxism, the characters state their opinions   by weaving  intertextual links with the Bible. Thus, to voice his political    answers, Lawrence’s writing becomes highly apocalyptic. By coupling  politics   and the Bible, the study offers an original reading of the  so-called   leadership novels which qualify as political essays.&lt;/p&gt;" />
