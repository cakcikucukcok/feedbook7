  <title>My Journey Back to Oneness - Mark Allen Perkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;We spend a great deal of our lives, both awake and asleep, wondering about the great mysteries of our lives. Why am I here? What is the meaning of life? Why me? Is there a God?
&lt;P&gt;
Many of these questions are unanswerable at this point in our path of enlightenment as humans. Many can be answered, if we allow ourselves to learn our lessons and Reconnect with the Divine Source!
&lt;P&gt;
Through &lt;b&gt;My Journey Back to Oneness&lt;/b&gt;, we will go on a journey of rediscovery. This journey offers you the probability of experiencing healing on physical, mental and spiritual levels. A journey back to the place where we all started...a place of Oneness with the Divine Source.
&lt;P&gt;
Our journey will begin with a refocusing of our perceptions of good and bad; us and them; and the other representation of duality that influences how we experience the world around us.
&lt;P&gt;
We will then get a glimpse of the concepts behind Hawaiian mysticism and Shamanism - and establish the basic understanding of energy and reality as defined in these concepts.
&lt;P&gt;
A brief comparison of religious beliefs follows along with an exploration of a very powerful healing tool - prayer. This is followed by an exploration of the applications of these concepts.
&lt;P&gt;
Next, we will investigate the ancient qualities and bacic nature of the concepts discussed. Futher, we will attempt to make ties between these concepts and the origins of human beings.
&lt;P&gt;
Finally, there are several appendices outlining recommended readings and training that can enhance your personal journey back to oneness.
&lt;/P&gt;
