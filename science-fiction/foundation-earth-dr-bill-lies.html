Lets see how this plays out, Jill, Brad said. They cant hurt us. We need to find out if this is a kidnapping or some other reason. 
This could be interesting, Jill said. I will send a message to Mom and Dad and let them know whats happening. Ill tell them we will stay in touch and not to worry. 
Sam received Jills message and immediately began to worry. Jim received the same message and told Sam that the kids could take care of themselves and it would be a learning experience. 
The van traveled for several miles. They were blindfolded and led to a small house, where their blindfolds were removed, and they were handcuffed to a chair by one arm.
