  <title>Mech-Row - Tim Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Through the blistering heat rising off the desert highway, Mark Axton deftly maneuvers a sports car at high speed. A test-driver for a major automobile magazine, the handsome, charismatic Axton lives a life of adventure that other men can only dream of. Yet as Axton and his assistant conduct their test-drive on this particular day, they are about to experience a chance encounter with a  former racecar driver and his gruff mechanic that could change Axton&#39;s life, and the lives of every human being on the planet, forever.&lt;/P&gt;
In &lt;I&gt;Mech-Row&lt;/I&gt; we meet a cast of characters thrown together by the unbelievable invention of the first truly nonpolluting high-performance automobile. As Axton and his new partners attempt to build and test a working prototype, their lives become interwoven in the pursuit of a revolutionary wonder vehicle that could actually become the solution to the world&#39;s pollution crisis. &lt;I&gt;Mech-Row&lt;/I&gt; takes us on a journey at a hundred miles per hour as Axton races to bring the amazing discovery to the world&#39;s attention. A fast-paced thriller, &lt;I&gt;Mech-Row&lt;/I&gt; is a standout in a new type of fiction set against the backdrop of the modern-day plight of planet Earth.&lt;/P&gt;" />
