      <meta name="description" content="When a single Ruminarii Hammerhead arrived to invade the small backwater Terran colony of Deanna, the people of Atro City went to meet them at the space port with open arms.  (Perhaps &#39;exposed&#39; is a better word?)  Life as a private investigator, slash bounty hunter isn&#39;t all Gary Beck wanted it to be.  There weren&#39;t any big mansions on a palm beach owned by an affluent writer generous enough to let him live rent-free and use his spare Ferrari.   But then, you have to ask yourself, what could you expect living on a planet like Deanna?  As a third rate colony in the Terran Empire, Deanna had more than its fair share of dull moments.  It orbited a star called Ramalama.  If you think that&#39;s funny, Deanna&#39;s two moons were called Ding and Dong, respectively.  (This is a local joke.)  Cindy Mei Winter hoped to put her violent and somehow depressing past behind her, but now it seemed her new beginning (and her holiday) were going to have to wait." />
