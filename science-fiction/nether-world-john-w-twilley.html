They have a little boy named Jimmy and a little dog named Macky. Seth loves his family and his work as a computer scientist. He has big dreams, and the future is golden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patty loves her husbands ambition to one day own his own computer company, and she works hard to help keep him focused. She is therefore concerned when Crazy Charley tries to make her husband his heir. Whats more, Patty knows that Charlie will stop at nothing to get Seth to say yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth thinks hes off the hook when Charley is killed in a fire, believing that Charleys obsession will die with him. But Charleys second in command isnt about to let a little thing like death derail the companys plan to bring the dead back to life, using ancient technology and a nuclear reactor. He wont take no for an answer, because Seth is the key to unlock the power of resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seths resolve to refuse Charleys legacy is shaken after Patty and Jimmy are killed in a car accident.Was it really an accident? Could this terrible power be used for good? How can Seth walk away from a chance to rescue his wife and child from the nether world?&lt;/p&gt;" />
