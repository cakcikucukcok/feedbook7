  <title>The Education of Innocence - Sophia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why this book?  During 2012 and beyond, humanity is faced with prophecies that predict an apocalyptic end.  Awakening the Souls power existing at higher levels of consciouseness can alter our collective fate and reverse the severe issues of inequality brought on by fear-based conditioning.  Left unchecked, civilization cannot be sustained where power monguls control global economy and over population and diminishing resources will force unimaginable consequences already slated for our future.  What are we to do?
The Education of Innocence is the Souls raison detre for existence.  It is the Mystery that has existed behind the Souls journey across time.  This story metaphorically addresses what caused our fall from grace and what compells our ascent into power, shattering the devastating illusions of the world, capable of bringing about a shift where anything becomes possible.
The Education of Innocence is set in the Kingdom of Oceana on the Planet of Galexia.  It is an underwater world where the Temples of the Goddess of the Sea is the only place where sea creatures are safe from deadly predators of the deep.  
The story begins with the birth of Little Sol, an innocent, who faces terrifying challenges in the ocean depths. Little Sol&#39;s journey becomes an awakening to higher consciousness balanced between bewildering, life-threatening situations mixed with wondrous magical encounters with sea creatures of all kinds.  
One such sea creature is Jason, a giant sea turtle, who becomes his mentor and explains the nature of reality and the challenges he must overcome when confronted by evil. He introduces him to The Sacred Sea Scrolls that speak of a prophecy of the return of the Original Ancestry of the Gods, Immortals of unparalleled powers, to be known in Book II.
Little Sol faces his greatest challenge when he stumbles upon The Dance of the Sacred Spiral of Life, a prophesied event where The Sacred Sea Dragons of legend make their appearance and mark him with a destiny that must come into remembrance.  [That destiny is the same every Soul must understand to become liberated from the challenges of the world of duality.]  If not for the sorcery magic of the Wizard Domaine, the Gatekeeper between Worlds, Little Sol would have remained in the Underworld of Death, possessed by evil he must still face in the future. 
The Final Reckoning heralds a time of total freedom or absolute destruction before the raging forces of Darkness.  The Temples of the Goddess of the Sea must marshall the greatest powers of the Mysteries to overcome the threat that lies before them." />
