  <title>E = Am2 - the 14Th Paradigm Shift - David Lucas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Professor Rachel Buddywell, Chair of the world-wide Commission, finds her own life story enmeshed in her revealing humanitys 14th paradigm shift  there is no inexplicable, just the unexplained as science encompasses the traditional realms of theology and philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her whole life has fashioned her for the unique task she confronts as Commission Chair. The influences that made her are commonplace, yet have produced a woman who is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a cognitive scientist, aided by presenters in anthropology, neuro-science, zoology and psychiatry, she weaves, amidst the conflicting objectives of her fellow Commissioners, the disparate scientific disciplines into a finished tapestry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegates and the Commissioners find the implications of todays science simultaneously thrilling and horrifying  but the science exist, so the genie is out of the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her unconventional love unbolts her lifes lynchpins, to seemingly mock her professional endeavours. This love confronts her work in the Commission and the core of who she is. The entwining of her professional life and her private life shapes her Commissions monumental report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story blends her struggles to unite tensions from the Commissioners and pressures from Delegates to identify universal human traits to be inculcated into human clones. Some Delegates cannot see the new way of the world as it is now much less as it will be tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, her life story twists and turns so unexpectedly as to be unimaginable, except that it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come and immerse yourself in Rachels life  both public and private.&lt;/p&gt;" />
