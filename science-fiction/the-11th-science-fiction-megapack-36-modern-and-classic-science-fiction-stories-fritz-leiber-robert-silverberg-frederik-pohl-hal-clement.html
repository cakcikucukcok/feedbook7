There&#39;s a greater emphasis than usual on Golden Age writers (just the way it came together) -- but we have one original story as well, a posthumous collaboration with H.B. Fyfe, finishing a really terrific but not-quite-done tale he had been working on before his death. It&#39;s a bit reminiscent of James Tiptree, Jr.&#39;s best work -- but predates Tiptree by a couple of decades. And we have novels by Robert Silverberg, Frederik Pohl &amp; C.M. Kornbluth, Murray Leinster, E. Everett Evans, and Donald Wollheim...not to mention part 2 of our serialization of Tony Rothman&#39;s mammoth 2013 novel, Firebird.
