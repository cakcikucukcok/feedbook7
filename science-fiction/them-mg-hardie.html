      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Them are everywhere, yet nowhere. They are warriors, soldiers, executors of fate. They are not human. They can&amp;#39;t be bargained with.

Otherworlders murder his wife, his daughter and him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devon was dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revived...hurt and alone, he does the only thing he can do...run. Armed with nothing he is forced to hide in the shadows, doing the unimaginable to survive. He is continually haunted by nightmares and pursued around the world by dark agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now inextricably entwined in an unknown plan, a tormented Devon must return home to get the answers he so desperately needs. He returns to where it all began seeking redemption and revenge, but how?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t trust your eyes, your ears or what you think you know because sometimes, it&amp;#39;s not skill, hard work or luck that determines who wins and who loses, or who succeeds and who fails...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sometimes it&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;Them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
