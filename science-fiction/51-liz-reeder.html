&lt;p&gt;When Lindsay assumes control of the department, she soon finds herself dealing with an incident that occurs on the local military base. Even worse, shes receiving calls regarding strange creatures and paranormal activities. Fortunately, she has the help of a federal agent who is in charge of the program that caused the problems.
