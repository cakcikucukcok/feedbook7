  <title>Enigma Planet of Gods - David Crane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="3,500 A.D. Thanks to the revolutionary gravity wings technology, mankind was finally able to leave the confines of the Earths solar system and seek out earth type planets capable of supporting human life. Professor Peter Blackwood, a former soldier, planetary explorer and teacher is a citizen of a powerful interstellar Confederation. Deciding to retire from decades of working in space and confronting hostile alien environments, he seeks a well-deserved retirement on an exotic planet of New Caledonia, where he plans to settle down and start a family. But on the way to his new home a mysterious energy cloud snatches him from his hyperspace tunnel, takes control of his ship and throws him into another part of the galaxy where he is forced to land on an alien planet many light years away from home.
The alien planet to Blackwoods surprise does contain life, an intelligent human life. Saved from native predators by an enigmatic young female with godlike powers, he learns that humans on planet Enigma are all descendants of the original crews of starships forced to land on this planet by the red cloud centuries ago. And on Enigma human beings are divided into commoners and powerful overlords, humans with immense powers of creation and destruction. Blackwoods arrival was foretold by an ancient prophecy. Forced into a dangerous sociopolitical game by a powerful alien intelligence, Blackwood has no choice but to transform himself from a scientist into a revolutionary. With millions of innocent lives at stake failure is not an option." />
