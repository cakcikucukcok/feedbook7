The Warrior Council felt that the students were to blame for the outcome. However, they agreed to support the students in their plan to relocate the population of the planet.  Only one thing stood in their way, the Cawte. The attack of the base on He&#39;konéenoo&#39;e was just the beginning. The Cawte soon swarmed into the transportation tunnels below the surface driving the Triskelia warriors back towards the Shining Ridge Mountains. The Triskelia knew that once they breached their last defense the Cawte would ravage their lands to the north killing all of them. The others grew stronger. Taking of the remaining mining facility allowed them to gain the necessary supplies to hold out until the man in Red returned." />
