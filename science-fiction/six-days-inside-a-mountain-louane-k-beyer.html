  <title>Six Days Inside a Mountain - Louane K. Beyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the two young boys fought against the raging fire and high winds, they sought refuge in a dark and scary looking cave they had seen as they had walked the area. It all began as a day trip in the foothills of a mountainous area to do some target practice with a new rifle. Due to distraction and disorientation, they find themselves in a dilemma of getting themselves not only lost but also putting their lives at risk. They try to make the best of it by hoping for a rescue but, unfortunately, the situation worsens as the campfire they built sets the forest on fire which isolates them. With the reality of the danger they are now facing, they begin to take steps to survival by making a plan to search for food and water together. 
Each day brings harrowing experiences as they walk deeper into the mountain all the while they learn more about each other. By using techniques learned in boy scouts and recalling material from books they have read, they overcome obstacles. This fictitious sci-fi adventure includes encounters with aliens whose space ship is embedded in the mountain. Through ingenuity, they develop a way to communicate with the aliens to learn from each other to accomplish the mission of exiting the mountain and going home." />
