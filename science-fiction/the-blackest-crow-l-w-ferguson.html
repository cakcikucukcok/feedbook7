  <title>The Blackest Crow - L.W. Ferguson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David Turner has just rescued his wife, Jesse, from a serial killer, albeit after being challenged to believe the impossible. With the aid of medical doctors, David crossed a subconscious plane to commit murder. It is said that beyond all reason, there exists another world. A world not controlled by rationality or predictable thought but the unpredictable subconscious mind. What happens if we discover that world? Through years of research, doctors had protected this well-kept secret. While Davids wife lay in a hospital bed in a coma after a car accident, these same doctors approached him with their research and invited him to believe. In an act of self-preservation, in another place and time, David believes he has killed a man and suffers with the consequences of his actions. When he goes to sleep, he relives the nightmare. 
Thomas Keyes, a decorated officer with the Newport police department, intent on bringing some of his own personal demons to rest, after a lengthy investigation into a string of murders, discovers that his main suspect, Aaron Edwards, a victim of a tortured childhood, has cheated death again. Thomas Keyes, who finds that his wife and daughter are a part of that list, must break the news to David and reopen the case. While David is relieved to know that he did not kill a man, he is tormented by the implications that his wife is still in danger. He as well as Thomas Keyes and the Newport police department must work together once again to stop Aaron in his tracks." />
