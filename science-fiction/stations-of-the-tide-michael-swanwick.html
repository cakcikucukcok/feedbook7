  <title>Stations of the Tide - Michael Swanwick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Nebula Award-wining novel from Michael Swanwick--one of the most brilliantly assured and darkly inventive writers of contemporary fiction--a masterwork of radically altered realities and world-shattering seductions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jubilee Tides will drown the continents of the planet Miranda beneath the weight of her own oceans. But as the once-in-two-centuries cataclysm approaches, an even greater catastrophe threatens this dark and dangerous planet of tale-spinners, conjurers, and shapechangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man from the Bureau of Proscribed Technologies has been sent to investigate. For Gregorian has come, a genius renegade scientist and charismatic bush wizard. With magic and forbidden technology, he plans to remake the rotting, dying world in his own evil image--and to force whom or whatever remains on its diminishing surface toward a terrifying and astonishing confrontation with death and transcendence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This novel of surreal hard SF was compared to the fiction of Gene Wolfe when it was first published, and the author has gone on in the two decades since to become recognized as one of the finest living SF and fantasy writers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Stations of the Tide - Michael Swanwick</i></b> | "Stations of the Tide" by Michael Swanwick is the story of an unnamed Bureaucrat and the urgent investigation he’s tasked with. The planet he lives on, Miranda, is subject to major tidal flooding every 200 years, and with the tide due to arrive in a week’s time on what’s called Jubilee Day, it’s imperative that he locate and apprehend the man Gregorian to avert disaster beforehand.<br /><b><i>Stations of the Tide by Michael Swanwick - Goodreads</i></b> | "Stations of the Tide" is more than deserving of the Nebula Award for Best Novel it won in 1992. I recommend it to any self-respecting science fiction fan, particularly any who love Roger Zelazny, R.A. Lafferty, or Bruce Sterling, three uniquely creative authors and personal favorites.<br /><b><i>Stations of the Tide: Swanwick, Michael: 9780765327918 ...</i></b> | Stations of the Tide Audible Audiobook – Unabridged Michael Swanwick (Author), Oliver Wyman (Narrator), Audible Studios (Publisher) &amp; 0 more 4.2 out of 5 stars 52 ratings<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Stations of the Tide - Michael Swanwick</a> </h3></p><hr/>
