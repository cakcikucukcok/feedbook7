      <meta name="description" content="Davin Mac Ferson is a young man who spent his young life not wanting to be different from anybody else. As he grew older, he wanted people to look up to him. His time in the Federation military gave him an opportunity to become a ship&#39;s engineer. As soon as his enlistment was completed, he found a job with a small transportation company. After a couple of years, he had had a belly full of small ports, backwater stations, and being blamed for the condition of the ship. What he longed for was the chance to be the Chief Engineer of a luxury liner. He dreamed of walking deck and having a passenger stopping him and asking him if he was the captain, and being able to tell then &#39;no I am the ship&#39;s chief engineer&#39; and continuing on his way. He never dreamed he would be left on a Transfer Station, black listed by the captain, and find a way off the station before he was put into servitude. He did not know that his chance meeting with a passenger on the ship would lead to his fight for survival in the Alpha quadrant." />
