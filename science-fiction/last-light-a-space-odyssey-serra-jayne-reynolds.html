  <title>Last Light: A Space Odyssey - Serra Jayne Reynolds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To Captain Domino York, a young rebel, a spacecraft is a means to take charge of her own destiny. She soon learns one of life&#39;s harder lessons, however, when federal goons show up to destroy, capture, and kill. She hadn&#39;t counted on her command coming at such steep price. Coming out of this alive requires hurdling those who stand against her. She&#39;s a genius, though, among other things. Even so, choosing the right path isn&#39;t always easy, especially when the men she needs to count on refuse to take her seriously. Ace in the hole notwithstanding, she can&#39;t recall ever being dealt such a rotten hand. Things go from bad to worse when Jake Garrett shows up. High tech weapons and their secrets don&#39;t mix well with spies willing sell them to the highest bidder. Jake Garrett makes a hobby of doing just that; and Domino has the very secrets everyone wants. Focus, a steady hand, and a sharp wit are called for. But are those enough to keep the Universe from blowing up? Domino hasn&#39;t the time to think otherwise." />
