  <title>Glory Main - Henry V. O&#39;Neil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We are closer to the Sims than we think &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, mankind has been locked in a war with an alien enemy that resembles the human race so closely they are known as the Sims. Both sides battle for control of habitable planets across the galaxies&amp;#8212;often at any cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Jander Mortas is fresh out of officer training and new to the war zone but eager to prove himself. There&amp;#39;s just one problem: disaster strikes while he&amp;#39;s traveling to his first assignment. He wakes to find himself marooned on a planet that appears deserted, with the only other survivors: a psychoanalyst, a conscientious objector, and a bitter veteran of a brutal slave-scout detachment. As the group struggles to reach safety on a nearby base, Glory Main, they discover a Sim colony&amp;#8212;which could mean their salvation, or their demise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrown together, they must fight the harsh elements, an ever-present enemy, and possibly each other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
