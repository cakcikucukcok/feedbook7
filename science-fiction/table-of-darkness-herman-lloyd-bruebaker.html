      <meta name="description" content="Kimberly shook her head. We&#39;re moving the investigation to Cambridge. You&#39;re to come with us. IP is sending your orders. Look, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. But I have never heard Howard so panic stricken.
	Was Freeman sighted in Cambridge? Swami wanted to know.
	Howard didn&#39;t say.
	And did he confirm what the man looks like now?
	No.
	Then we&#39;re running blind again. Swami thoughtfully looked around them. For a few moments the captain was confused what to do. Then his wavering soon faded. You go ahead but I&#39;ll stay awhile. I need to discuss a few matters with the money changer. Swami was silent for a few moments then he soberly said. I&#39;ll catch up with you later on. Hopefully, I will bring good news. But the matter stands. If we don&#39;t discover what changes he went through, our chances of cornering Freeman is nil.
Chapter Eleven
	The private air field not far from London wasn&#39;t that   busy as their VIP aircraft taxied to a hanger away from the terminal. After spending hours in flight, the weary couple   was still confused why they rapidly made their exit from India. Garnett repeatedly tried contacting Howard but never received a response. While disembarking outside the hanger, Garnett was surprised when seeing the thick foggy conditions. He wondered what stupid air controller allowed a touchdown in such conditions. The marine officer then thoughtfully surveyed their surroundings. He didnt like this isolation that could easily develop into a belligerent situation. It was then that he saw the 3 unfriendly business suits standing nearby, their attention reserved for the aircraft he had just stepped from. They suspiciously made no aggressive movements but silently stood their ground. There were 10 hangers with no planes parked outside which was suspicious. This was no chance arrival but a carefully set up meeting of sorts. Why instantly perked his cautious response. Garnett about to ask Kimberly what she thought saw her wide smile. Then he saw an older man walking from the hanger happily waving at Kimberly.   
Afterwards, Garnett quietly stood aside while Kimberly excitedly greeted her uncle. In the following few minutes he was ignored while they rapidly talked. Garnett wasn&#39;t familiar with the Israeli language so their discussion meant nothing to him. Whatever they were talking about occasionally caused the disagreeable uncle to lose his smile. When Garnett was about to walk away from the plane, the security men politely shook their heads. Garnett nodded and didn&#39;t try that again. Minutes later a gasoline tanker pulled alongside their plane while the business suits   cautiously monitored the refueling. Not until the truck finished did the Israelis relax. Temperatures kept dropping as thick fog slowly engulfed that airfield. 
	Finally, Kimberly stopped reminiscing and looked at Garnett patiently waiting a few feet away. Honey, this is my Uncle Joshua Lahav. Then she looked at the husky man at her side and said cordially. I want you to meet my better half, Garnett Lewis. He&#39;s the one I told you about.
	The husky built man with a neatly trimmed gray beard extended his hand. I have heard much about you, my good man. The gray eyes sparkled with friendliness while his grip was strong. My niece tells me you have a very complicated covert on your hands?
	Garnett shrugged his agreement. Its definitely having some moments, sir.
	 That I can understand, he replied, in a smooth English accent that momentarily caught Garnett off guard. When glancing at Kimberly his voice became more serious. Im afraid your moments are about to worsen.
	Then youre familiar with the Book of Sakkare? Garnett curiously asked.
	Yes, more than I want to be. Far back as Moses our people have known about the Book of Sakkare. Dressed in his tailored gray suit Joshua looked to be a ladys man. He was handsome for his fifty-three years and radiated a trust mos" />
