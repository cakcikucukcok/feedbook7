  <title>The Mooroos - Albert Louis Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Trillions of years have passed since the Mooroo race burst forth from the pairing of two alien creatures. For eons, the Mooroos have reigned over many territories, fulfilling their unquenchable desire to preserve the species. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The instinct to flourish burns in Soomooroo and Moochoomoo, longtime companions who live on Voormoo, their celestial home. When Soomooroo wins the deed to a large galaxy in an ancient card game, the pair launches a scouting expedition to explore every expanse of the boundless universe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In the process, they encounter a range of alien species, including the Swoomoows, the Nogonogs, and the Yellow Dog of Heuweltjies Plateau, some of which are peaceful, others unwelcoming. They also seek out Goddoo, the creator of all, to stand in his presence and thank him for bringing forth light across the great void of darkness. Most importantly, Soomooroo ensures the Mooroovian race will live on through his son, the first Mooroovian to inherit eternal life and race memory, ensuring everlasting existence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Science fiction devotees, especially fans of the Klingon language developed for&lt;I&gt; Star Trek: The Motion Picture,&lt;/I&gt; will want to start &lt;I&gt;The Mooroos &lt;/I&gt;with its extensive glossary of alien terms to appreciate this high-tech, science fiction adventure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;" />
