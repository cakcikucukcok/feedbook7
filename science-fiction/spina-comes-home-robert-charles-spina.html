  <title>Spina Comes Home - Robert Charles Spina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What would happen if an Alien Queen was free on earth? What would happen if the only creature in the universe that has evolved to prey upon and feed exclusively on alien flesh made its way to earth? What would happen when galactic predators learned of this activity? What would happen if the United States Military learned of missing people in the Adirondack Mountains and observed an alien vessel landing in the Adirondack Mountains? The Alien Queen has grown her hive to mass proportions and they are now a society poised to be the dominant species on earth. Never before seen or known witness the birth of the Alien King. See the Bonclee, an alien species with the amazing ability to transform from a four-legged animal to a bipedal animal. They have amazing bone structure that can withstand all alien attacks and are immune to acid. See the devastating claws of the Bonclee, and they have jaws that will shock you. See the army rangers, navy seals, marines, special  operations, and special military task force teams use knowledge passed on to them from the very few who have knowledge of this threat. See our military dish out destruction like never before because Mr. Wayland is back. His twin brother died at the hands of the predators. Now our military men have the ability to cloak from the predators and have special ammunition able to pierce predator armor. This is nonstop action and monster mayhem from start to finish, but you still have not seen the best part. See the never told story of Greygan &quot;The Little Warrior.&quot; In 1785, a young man was targeted by a predator to be a trophy because of his exceptional hunting ability. See Greygans amazing journey through space and how he became a predator. Now after over two hundred years in space Greygan &quot;The Little Warrior&quot; returns to Earth to eliminate its greatest threat ever. See the magnificence of the alien king. See the surprisingly docile Bonclee as they feed on aliens. See the military teams dish out destruction. See the predators hunt every species in their way. See the Alien Queen rule her domain and see Greygan, the galaxy&#39;s only human predator. With new species, new monsters, new weaponry, and the human dilemmas faced by Greygan, alien and predator fans around the world will be highly excited by this book, Spina Comes Home." />
