  <title>Escaping Exodus - Nicky Drayden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t be alarmed - that dizzy pleasurable sensation you&#39;re experiencing is just your brain slowly exploding from all the wild magnificent worldbuilding in Nicky Drayden&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Escaping Exodus&lt;/em&gt;. I loved these characters and this story, and so will you.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#160;- Sam J. Miller, Nebula-Award-winning author of &lt;em&gt;The Art of Starving&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Blackfish City&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Compton Crook award&amp;#8211;winning author of &lt;em&gt;The Prey of Gods&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Temper &lt;/em&gt;returns with a dazzling stand-alone novel, set in deep space, in which the fate of humanity rests on the slender shoulders of an idealistic and untested young woman&amp;#8212;a blend of science fiction, dark humor, and magical realism that will appeal to fans of Charlie Jane Anders, Jeff VanderMeer, and Nnedi Okorafor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth is a distant memory. Habitable extrasolar planets are still out of reach. For generations, humanity has been clinging to survival by establishing colonies within enormous vacuum-breathing space beasts and mining their resources to the point of depletion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rash, dreamy, and unconventional, Seske Kaleigh should be preparing for her future role as clan leader, but her people have just culled their latest beast, and she&amp;#8217;s eager to find the cause of the violent tremors plaguing their new home. Defying social barriers, Seske teams up with her best friend, a beast worker, and ventures into restricted areas for answers to end the mounting fear and rumors. Instead, they discover grim truths about the price of life in the void. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, Seske is unexpectedly thrust into the role of clan matriarch, responsible for thousands of lives in a harsh universe where a single mistake can be fatal. Her claim to the throne is challenged by a rival determined to overthrow her and take control&amp;#8212;her intelligent, cunning, and confident sister. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seske may not be a born leader like her sister, yet her unorthodox outlook and incorruptible idealism may be what the clan needs to save themselves and their world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
