  <title>Escape by Death - Mary-Jo Balman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Harriet Jarreau cannot bear the thought of the end of her marriage to Peter, who married for her substantial fortune.  No longer able to tolerate an oppressive marriage, he decides to leave her.  His relief at this decision is palpable even though he is aware of the luxurious life he is about to give up...unless somehow she were gone. 
 	 Stephen, Harriet&#39;s nephew, is a beneficiary of her Will. He also constantly cajoles her into implementing the meager allowance she gives him as Trustee of an inheritance from his late mother.  Beneath his affable facade, however, he feels a burning resentment toward her and her control over him in denying what is rightfully his. 
 	  Andr, Stephen&#39;s significant other, is forbidden to enter Harriet&#39;s  home because of his &quot;disgraceful&quot; relationship with her nephew.  He despises her and reminds Stephen of the luxurious life they could enjoy if only Harriet weren&#39;t around. 
   	Katy, the housemaid, is in love with Peter.  She is naive in her belief that he returns her feelings because of his occasional flattering remarks.  Her disdain toward Harriet is unrestrained, and she unequivocally believes she would be the next Mrs. Jarreau if only Harriet didn&#39;t exist.
	Faced with these unacceptable circumstances in their lives, who will be desperate enough to escape...by a death?" />
