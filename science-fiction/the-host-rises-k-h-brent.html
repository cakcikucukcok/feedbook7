  <title>The Host Rises - K. H. Brent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;K.H. Brents stellar debut novel, the first instalment in his Promised Land saga, is a page-turning fusion of apocalyptic fiction, science fiction and mainstream thriller.&quot; - BlueInk Review
&quot;A smart, delightfully offbeat tale with shades of sci-fi and military action.&quot;- Kirkus Indie, a review service of Kirkus Reviews
&quot;Reminiscent of Arthur C. Clarkes seminal 1953 novel Childhoods End, Brents book is everything good science fiction should be: powered by deeply considered speculation, relentlessly thought-provoking and, above all else, visionary.&quot;-BlueInk Review.
&quot;Brent delivers a worthy novel...&quot;-  Kirkus Indie, a review service of Kirkus Reviews
&quot;Bottom line: The Host Rises is better than the majority of science fiction releases currently on the shelves. Yes, its that good.&quot;- BlueInk Review
&quot;...the ending is truly remarkable and a stunning preamble to Book 2.&quot;- Kirkus Indie, a review service of Kirkus Reviews
In the near future, dysfunctional governments and powerful mega-corporations have created a world of unending violence, leaving it teetering on extinction. Out of nowhere arrives the Host- a mysterious entity armed with the ability to bring instant death to anyone or everyone on the planet.
The Host has one demand- end the cycle of violence and war immediately or face annihilation. A new era dawns- The Peace. Aided by the Servants of the Host, humanity begins to tackle its root problems; working to achieve what the Host calls The Promised Land. The quest for The Promised Land has its dark side, however. The Host can commit horrible atrocities against those who resist its will- those with much to lose in the new order.
Some believe the Host is Satan himself, others believe they are the victims of an alien occupation.
Journalist Grace Williams and Special Agent John Harriman find themselves thrown together; she to find the true nature of the Host, he to neutralize its grip on the planet and restore the old order. The two must race against time to uncover the secret of the Host before its too late." />
