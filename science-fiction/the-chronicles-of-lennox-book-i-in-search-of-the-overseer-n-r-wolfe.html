      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A beautiful Federation Enforcer desired by two men&amp;hellip; and hunted by a monster&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a young girl sees her beloved father murdered before her eyes by a nightmarish monster, she resolves to follow in his footsteps, fighting evil across the galaxies. She finds herself on an odyssey, torn between her feelings for two very different men. And all the while, she is hunted by the monster who creeps ever closer. Who will she choose as her consort? And who will win&amp;hellip;the Enforcer or The Overseer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Lennox Red Wolefi&amp;#39;saunti always knew what she would be when she grew up--an officer of the Federation InterUniversal Galaxy Sector 1, a peacekeeper an Enforcer. And so far, she has not only followed in her beloved father&amp;#39;s footsteps, she has surpassed him. She&amp;#39;s now the one they call to solve the unsolvable crimes, a decorated officer with numerous criminal bounties on her head.&lt;br /&gt; Her partner Jax has her back--and if her AI companion would back off, he&amp;#39;d like to have a lot more. Somehow Jax always finds himself at arms-length from the woman he loves. But when Lennox is kidnapped by Gat&amp;#39;lin, and brain-washed into believing she is his, Jax must use every weapon he has to fight for her.&lt;br /&gt; Gat&amp;#39;lin of Prime House, Ruler of the Barauk&amp;#39;nau&amp;#39;te Sector, wants Lennox with every fiber of his being. He knows she is the one female for him. If only he can keep her safe at his side. For something, or someone is hunting her. Something that wants death and destruction at any cost. He and Jax must find a way to work together if they are to keep her safe&amp;hellip; from The Overseer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
