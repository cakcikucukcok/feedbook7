FROM THE PROLOGUE: 
In 1999 a new island unexplainably emerged from the Sargasso Sea. The scientific world was never able to agree about how it had formed. When one of the seven expedition teams made a sensational discovery that would have seemingly revealed the island&#39;s mystery, the whole area was closed off. Further expeditions were carried out in secret by special military units. The public was told that the island had come into being through a volcanic eruption. Then all reports of the island disappeared from the media and the island was forgotten. The first civilian scientists that had begun studying the island were sworn to silence.
Nevertheless the rumors and speculation continued. Professor Kim, the former leader of the international team of scientists, had found a nearly rotted diary in the niche of a cliff. It had belonged to an English writer by the name of Douglas Goldfield who, according to the notes, had already lived on the island at the end of the 19th Century. In the diary he had described the island&#39;s secret and the fairytale-like story of the island&#39;s queen, Tarana, who ruled there a realm of immortality. Scientists of all disciplines were stirred up in the first weeks about the discovery of the diary, especially because many other discoveries on the island seemed to confirm the story that Douglas Goldfield had written nearly one hundred years earlier about his fate, the immortal Tarana, about the island itself and its mysterious future. Although no one could disprove Goldfields words, the specialists and scientists remained sceptical. After the military took over the further investigations the diary was declared a fake and with it the miracle and the riddle of that island, which was, however, included in the ocean maps as the &quot;Island of Immortality&quot;. Only Professor Kim, who had found the diary, remained utterly convinced for the rest of his life that the little book was not only accurate in every word of its description of another form of reality, but also that it contained a world-shaking revelation about the future of all life.
It is for that reason that, after Douglas Goldfield&#39;s diary entries, I want to tell the story of Tarana and the Island of Immortality. My name is not important. But I will tell you this: We will meet face to face when the things have taken place that are reported by Douglas Goldfield and, more so, Tarana." />
