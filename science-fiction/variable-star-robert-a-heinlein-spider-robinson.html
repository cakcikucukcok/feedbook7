  <title>Variable Star - Robert A. Heinlein, Spider Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A never-before-published masterpiece from science fiction&#39;s greatest writer, rediscovered after more than half a century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Joel Johnston first met Jinny Hamilton, it seemed like a dream come true. And when she finally agreed to marry him, he felt like the luckiest man in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was just one small problem. He was broke. His only goal in life was to become a composer, and he knew it would take years before he was earning enough to support a family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jinny wasn&#39;t willing to wait. And when Joel asked her what they were going to do for money, she gave him a most unexpected answer. She told him that her name wasn&#39;t really Jinny Hamilton---it was Jinny Conrad, and she was the granddaughter of Richard Conrad, the wealthiest man in the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now that she was sure that Joel loved her for herself, not for her wealth, she revealed her family&#39;s plans for him---he would be groomed for a place in the vast Conrad empire and sire a dynasty to carry on the family business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most men would have jumped at the opportunity. But Joel Johnston wasn&#39;t most men. To Jinny&#39;s surprise, and even his own, he turned down her generous offer and then set off on the mother of all benders. And woke up on a colony ship heading out into space, torn between regret over his rash decision and his determination to forget Jinny and make a life for himself among the stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was on his way to succeeding when his plans--and the plans of billions of others--were shattered by a cosmic cataclysm so devastating it would take all of humanity&#39;s strength and ingenuity just to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
