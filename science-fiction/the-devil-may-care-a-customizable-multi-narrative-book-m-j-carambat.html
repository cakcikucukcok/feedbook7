      <meta name="description" content="Against all odds, the first privately owned space probe was on its way to Mars, but chief engineer Trevor Cadogan couldn&#39;t sleep--the demon was back, filling his head.   Wicked-sharp claws, stubby curving horns and a viscous forked tale, long and scaly. The thing stood there, shifting back and forth, mocking him, silhouetted against an angry, red glow. The smoky half-light invoked a debilitating terror, flooding his mind with a premonition of doom  fanned by the flames of hell...  What is a Multi-Narrative Book? This story is a customizable Multi-Narrative experience. There is only ONE plot, with ONE beginning and ONE end, but there are SEVEN different ways to customize your reading enjoyment!  You chose the way you want it to be told, and the book will self-abridge itself without missing any major plot elements. Your choices only serve to emphasize the parts that you are most interested in.  For the first time ever, you can now read a book that tailors itself to you!" />
