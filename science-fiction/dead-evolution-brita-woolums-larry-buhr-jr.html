&lt;p&gt;As they travel east, Alexia and Hawk must learn how to survive while battling voracious zombies and escaping ruthless renegades.

Meanwhile, Lucas Kruczek and his daughter, Leah, mourn the loss of their loved ones while building a fortress around their city. Forced to live under the strict rule of a fugitive from another planet, father and daughter make many alliesincluding Alexia, Hawk, and Sydney, a little girl forced to grow up fast or die young.&lt;/p&gt;
