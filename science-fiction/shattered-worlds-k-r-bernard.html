  <title>Shattered Worlds - K. R. Bernard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book consists of ten short stories with my own original plots, characters and twists in each short story. The Exiles Orb is about an indifferent and bullied boy named, KB. Who soon gets abducted by an evil barbaric alien race from his middle school to be interrogated about a powerful Orb that the boy once had, but KB doesnt know what or where the Orb is. The leader of the alien race Master Odin keeps KB as one of his prisoners, but he escapes from the prison to meet up with a girl named Kristy who introduces him to a man that can help him find the Orb. Does KB find the Exiles Orb in time or does Master Odin conquer the universe? If you like a horror I have one uniquely scary story for you entitled Curse High. Is a tale about a high school African American boy named Greg who is first being haunted by a demonic spirit that is taking its vengeances out on Gregs friends, family and his high school crush Nina. But first he needs to find out who the demonic spirit is and why this ultra-violent spirit is taking its revenge out on him. Greg soon finds out he must save Nina from the demon. Does Greg save her or does he fail miserably?" />
