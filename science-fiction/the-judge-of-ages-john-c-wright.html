  <title>The Judge of Ages - John C. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The year is 10,515 AD. The Hyades Armada, traveling at near lightspeed, will reach Earth in just four centuries to assess humanity&#39;s value as slaves. For the last 8,000 years, two opposing factions have labored to meet the alien threat in very different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them is Ximen del Azarchel, immortal leader of the mutineers from the starship &lt;i&gt;Hermetic&lt;/i&gt; and self-appointed Master of the World, who has allowed his followers to tamper continuously with the evolutionary destiny of Man, creating one bizarre race after another in an apparent search for a species the Hyades will find worthy of conquest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other is Menelaus Montrose, the posthuman Judge of Ages, whose cryonic Tombs beneath the surface of Earth have preserved survivors from each epoch created by the Hermeticists. Montrose intends to thwart the alien invaders any way he can, and to remain alive long enough to be reunited with his bride Rania, who is on a seventy-millennia journey to confront the Hyades&#39; masters, tens of thousands of light-years away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with the countdown to the Hyades&#39; arrival nearing its end, del Azarchel and Montrose square off for what is to be their final showdown for the fate of Earth, a battle of gunfire and cliometric calculus; powered armor and posthuman intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Judge of Ages &lt;/i&gt;is the wildly inventive third volume in a series exploring future history and human evolution from John C. Wright. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
