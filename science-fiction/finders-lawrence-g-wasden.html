      <meta name="description" content="FINDERS is a Sci-Fi, action packed, adventure thriller that will leave you sitting on the edge of your seat. You will not want to put it down! FINDERS is written in a Sci-Fi style that will lead you to believe that the story could actually happen. The story encompasses the lives of two eleven year old best friends, Josh Hampton and Darnel Ellis, who go on summer vacation with Joshs family to the mountains of Pennsylvania. The family would stay in a cabin for the summer and enjoy the beauty of their surroundings on Knotts mountain. Everything would seem so perfect, what could possibly go wrong? The boys enthusiastic exploration of the mountain proved to be more than they bargained for when they ventured to a place called Knotts peak! Their curiosity leads them to the discovery of a life-time that will take them to a place where no human has ever gone before, nor for that matter, even imagined. The story involves not only Josh and Darnel, but their families as well when legal authorities try to find out what caused the boys disappearance. Unforeseen events would bring the two families closer together than you can imagine. Can these families elude the events that may destroy their world?" />
