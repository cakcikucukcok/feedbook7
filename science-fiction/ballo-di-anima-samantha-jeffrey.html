  <title>Ballo Di Anima - Samantha Jeffrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was lying in the middle of a great open grass area. I wasn&#39;t sure, but in the distance was what looked to be a playground. It reminded me of the night Id got drunk at the party my best friend Emma had taken me to and somehow got knocked out. But I couldnt be there. When mum found out she freaked and made me leave my beloved Queensland to live in Massacro. Then what was I doing laying here? It had to be a dream . . . but it seemed so real.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I could feel the cold wind blowing softly at the back of my neck, making my hair swirl around my face. I could smell the mist drifting above the damp grass. And I could feel my head hammering violently due to my drunken state and the knock I got to my head thanks to a drunken boy fight. My vision was hazy due to the sleep in my eyes, not to mention the fact that it was pitch black and my eyes hadn&#39;t adjusted to the lack of light yet.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But there in the distance, I was sure I could see someone standing there. I couldnt see who it was but I could see the outline of a human body." />
