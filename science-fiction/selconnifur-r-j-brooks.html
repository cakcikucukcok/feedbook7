  <title>Selconnifur - R.J. Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This incredible story begins when a series of seemingly unrelated events take place along the California Coast. Throw in a few earthquakes of various magnitude and you have a perfect mix to kick-off this story.
Max, my main character, is truly a genius, and also a thief. He has begged, borrowed and stolen the millions that were required to build his fantastic invention, a machine called Pellucidar. He has no intention of paying back his lenders and will not relinquish ownership of the Pellucidar to anyone. The Federal Government, the Defense Department, and every major lending institution, comprise a group of the ultimate victims of Maxs financially elaborate plan to finance and use his state of the art invention.
Among the crew of the Pellucidar are some of the best minds in their various disciplines. Some of their specialties are in Medicine, Engineering, Biology, and Electronics. Those people are all very close friends of Max, they are all volunteers and consider themselves lucky to be a part of Maxs crew. When the largest quake hit California, Max and his entire crew were on-board the Pellucidar when a suddenly opening fissure swallowed Maxs great machine . . . the adventure begins. To the surprise of all on-board, they found themselves in a vast subterranean world, miles beneath the earths outer crust. Many unique species of life, heretofore unknown to man, were discovered there, and a multitude of related adventures happen along the way.
During their random explorations, actual contact was established with an alien race. Their technology and machines were far in-advance of the sciences of earth.
While on their mission exploration, through an unusual series of circumstances, it was learned that the entire surface of the earth was being consumed by nuclear chain reactions, the end-result of global thermonuclear war. Earth itself seemed to be on Self Destruct. It was only a matter of time until the steadily increasing heat and radiation laid claim to the remnants of the Human Race.
With the survival of the Human Race hanging in the balance, this was the time that Selconnifur would prove his worth. The clock is ticking.
IT IS THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW AND THE TIME IS NOW!" />
