  <title>Wake-Up Call - Joaquin De Torres, Dr. Joseph De Torres</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One hundred mental patients are brutally massacred in the frigid cold of a Russian forest as they wait for a mysterious light coming down from the night sky.  Their deaths are never spoken of again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than three decades later, directors at mental hospitals in California are stunned when 100 patients&amp;mdash;comatose for years&amp;mdash;suddenly &amp;quot;wake up&amp;quot; and speak of a person called &amp;quot;The Commander&amp;quot; who will lead them to a place where they will be taken from Earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One person may hold the answers&amp;mdash;a severely mentally-ill homeless man whose knowledge of astronomy, physics and mathematics is not only more advanced than Einstein and Tesla, but can summon superhuman abilities in the blink of an eye.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taken in and protected by a small team of mental health physicians, a brilliant astrophysicist, a derelict naval officer, and a renowned Ancient Aliens theorist, this freakishly gifted person called &amp;quot;Doogie&amp;quot; warns that time is running out; that the &amp;quot;creators&amp;quot; are already on their way to Earth.  They will arrive within weeks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The chosen hundred must be ready, but like 30 years ago, a new threat makes its presence menacingly clear.  A xenophobic Senator with a horrific secret and the authority to launch military strikes is plotting to destroy an extraterrestrial visitation of any kind. . .even if it means the deaths of thousands, if not the utter destruction of the entire West Coast." />
