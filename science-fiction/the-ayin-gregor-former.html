  <title>The Ayin - Gregor Former</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;I wrote The Ayin in the second half of 1995 and the beginning of 1996 while I was living in London, England. A number of mishaps over the ensuing years prevented me from further working on the book until the fall of 1999, and since then everything has moved at a rapid pace culminating with the publication of the book in May 2000 by Xlibris. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story could be considered a cyberpunk tale of sorts, but unlike many such books, it has a firm basis in science and includes a number of items that could be (and surely will be) manufactured in the not-too-distant future. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;My main focus is on the potential effect that the future of artificial intelligence will have upon our understanding of ourselves and existence in general. Some may argue that I have broken the rules of science as it is currently understood with where I take the story, but I believe time will bear out the conclusions I have drawn about the real potential inherent within quantum physics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all else, I hope everyone who reads the book finds it enjoyable and if it can also make you think in the process, all the better! Thanks. &lt;/P&gt;" />
