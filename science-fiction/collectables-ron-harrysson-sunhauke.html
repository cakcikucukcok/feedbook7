  <title>Collectables - Ron Harrysson Sunhauke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In his collection of short tales, poet and storyteller Ron Harrysson Sunhauke (Schaefer) provides a glimpse into a bizarre, humorous, and sometimes frightening world of fantasy as he leads a diverse group of characters on a madcap ride from hometowns to outer space; from youth to old age; and from fascinating possibilities to the wildly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
Marvin is a geek who one day discovers a humiliating protuberance on his face. As the pimple grows to an enormous size, Marvin continues to suffer at the expense of his classmates. But one day, Marvin will prove to everyone that looks are not everything. Young Purvis Peevis is rather egregious when it comes to mischief, but his curiosity gets the best of him when he steals a tiny bell from his neighbor that proves to have more power than he ever could have imagined. Middle-aged Bill usually spends his weekends mowing his lawn, but when he shows up at a Bliss Academy seminar, he is told he will soon meet a friendly neighborhood space alien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Collectables&lt;/i&gt; creates forty whimsical journeys that blend the qualities of outer worldly planets and small-town America, forming tales where reality and imagination mingle and generate unforgettable fantasy adventures." />
