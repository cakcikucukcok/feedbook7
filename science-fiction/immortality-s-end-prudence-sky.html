  <title>Immortality’S End - Prudence Sky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Sun finally comes closer to Earth and kills humanity in AD 2600. While Tara is waiting for the world to end with Kevin in the Pacific Ocean, she is looking back on her life. 
She takes the readers back 752 years to her cotton plantation home in South Carolina. She remembers her small family, meeting new ones and discovering her immortality at the age of ten. 
Her memories take us to the end of the Civil War and early 1900s. She meets an Apache tribe, who gives her clues about her father, an immortal that has been missing since her childhood. She also discovers her second ability of understanding different languages. 
Throughout her life, she meets other immortals and learns of her secret location. She has to stay seventy years to gain strength and adapt to a new, upcoming world. Gaining strength through martial arts and meditation, she protects their secret without killing anyone. Tara also discovers her empathic and psychic abilities. She learns how to channel her abilities with physical strength. When she renews her life, her new names and identities give her purpose, until she gives up on humanity. She remembers meeting a vampire that will change her forever. 
Her mind flashes into New Years Day of 2600; she reunites with all immortals on Earth. All humans die because of the sun. Now all they have is each other." />
