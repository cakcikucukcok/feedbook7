      <meta name="description" content="Agent Mark Tracker Hunter and Russian agent Nitasha have joined forces at the advice of their governments. They enter the deep desert to find the damaged alien computer which has been buried for thousands of years as mapped on an ancient map. The ruthless billionaire Joseph Kavanaughs hired mercenaries, lead by the internationally known notorious Bernard DeLoutch, are trailing right behind them. DeLoutch is able to snatch the damaged alien computer. Those working for Kavanaugh fix the computer and use the alien technology to make his island impregnable to Earth weapons. Also, through alien technology, they are able to attack and destroy world governments. Kavanaugh continued to use the damaged communication panel which broadcasted his transmission on an open frequency through out the galaxy that any extraterrestrial entity could pickup. The evil alien, Lord Haqoum Gurlock, the supreme commander of the combined fleets and forces of the Intergalactic Ruling Council, picks up the transmission. Planet Earth is placed under siege to strip it from its natural resources and then to test fire a doomsday weapon capable of shattering planets. If the people from Earth and the friendly aliens do not destroy the doomsday weapon in time, Earth will be reduced to rubble.&lt;p&gt;
