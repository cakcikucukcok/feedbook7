  <title>Hell Came on a Pretty Day - Bryce Thunder King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After Jamie and Angie watch a surveillance tape of two men brutally killing two innocent police officers, something inside them breaks  or perhaps something is fixed.&lt;p&gt; 
Either way, they know that they can be better crime fighters than those standing around doing nothing. So they begin petitioning the highest levels of government to offer their help.&lt;p&gt; 
Eventually, they meet the president of the United States. Persuaded by their patriotism, he arranges for them to begin training to become super human fighting machines.&lt;p&gt; 
Lurking in the background, however, is crime lord Tony Nastasi, successor to Eric Bonastie, who assumed control of a criminal organization known as MEAW International. The M stands for money, the E for espionage, the A for ammunition, and the W for weapons.&lt;p&gt; 
Angie, who was pursued by Jamie, is the former mistress of Eric. Seeking revenge, Eric, in an earlier period, forced Jamie to a shootout and was blown up by a Molotov cocktail thrown by Jamie.&lt;p&gt; 
Now there is bad blood between MEAW, Jamie and Angie.&lt;p&gt; 
Join Jamie and Angie as they battle villains in firefights, fight for their country and put their love above everything else in HELL CAME on a pretty day: Vigilante Justice." />
