  <title>Spin Cycle - Elias Souri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Rana has two names. The other name is Qubert Spin, but in truth these names are facetious tags. Qubert is the most descriptive for those who care, and for those who dont, Jonathan sounds more natural, for one who is unnatural, but invites less curiosity, while the other has a nice spin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the course of a few years, Qubert came into being, an offspring of so many. Rare was the person who could foresee the outcome of such an eclectic undertaking, but once realized was helpless to convince anyone else. No credible supervisor could claim the existence of an animate computer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quantum physics is not a hot topic in the culture of today or for that matter of yesterday. All of those sub-atomic particles, actually wave forms, are the same on earth as at the edge of the universe; they undulate and spin. Once enough of those wave forms are regimented into productive alignment, a door will open. Now comes the choice of either crossing the threshold or not. Its a safe bet what happens next. In this account, there is Qubert, full of human traits, with an ambition for descendants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cultural forerunners have detractors, hostile and afraid, thus being unique brings great risk, even loathing. In contrast there are others who have no fear, quietly anticipating things to come. Too often there have been attempts to predict the technology of the future, which end as wishful thinking. The safest narrative is to employ predictable human behavior, blend in the technical basics, and the rest will follow. Herein are the basics for the characters to manage thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;" />
