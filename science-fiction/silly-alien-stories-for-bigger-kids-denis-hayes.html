  <title>Silly Alien Stories for Bigger Kids - Denis Hayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do other superior beings really exist outside of Earth? Of course they do and in this book they are very active all over the Universe but not always in a serious way.
The Sramsians, Sunevians and Otulpians are from three identical planets in the same orbit around the same sun in a very old galaxy on the far side of the Universe that has no sides. They come from a galaxy so old that it has forgotten its name and so is just called The Oldest Galaxy.
The Creator has made them the Caretakers, Custodians, and the Commissioners of the Universe as the Creator is very busy creating.
This first book in the series centres around their activities and relationships with a rather primitive planet they call Earth which they observe and sometimes interfere with as though it were a Zoo.
They revue and alter the Earthlets knowledge of Gods, Science, Technology, Sport, Climate, Environment and everything else sometimes successfully and sometimes disastrously but always with an impish sense of mischief.
This is the Universe that will make scientists and others sit up and think again.
Well that is the hope of the Aliens at least!" />
