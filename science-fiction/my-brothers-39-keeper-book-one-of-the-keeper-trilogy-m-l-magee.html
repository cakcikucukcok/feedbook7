  <title>My Brothers&#39; Keeper: Book One of the Keeper Trilogy - M. L. Magee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Scarlette Manning is thirteen years old, she witnesses a tragedy in her family and is forced from that day forward to carry the guilt and responsibility of a gift that she involuntarily receives: mystical powers. Because her parents believe magic is the family curse rather than a gift, she is forced to master her powers in secret in order to protect herself and her family from supernatural dangers.   Now twenty-two, Scar has lived a lie, concealing the most important aspect of herself from those she loves most. She believes she has been successful in hiding her powers-until the night when one of her brothers has a life-altering experience that sends her spiraling back to the horrific event of her childhood. Although she cannot change his fate, she may yet be able to use her craft to tip the scales from death to life.   In this novel of magic and the supernatural, only time will tell whether a young witch can keep her family safe from the terrors that roam their town." />
