  <title>World of Niecro - Elias Zuriel Shalohm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the dawn of a great war, LukeZurg lived on a planet called Niecro. The war seemed inevitable, so the young man voluntarily enlisted into the Niecronian Space Defense. After proving his abilities, he was assigned a highly classified position and issued unique weapons and gear that allowed him to travel through time, space, and alternate dimensions to defend and protect the planet and its allies from the threat of war.
As the war progressed, an unusual twist of fate confronted Luke. When he discovered an enemy race of reptilians possessing similar powers of time travel, Luke searched for clues to end the war, but a heavy barrage of laser fire hit his base, killing everyone in the project and injuring Luke in the process. As a result of this attack, Luke lost all memory of his missions as Z, defender of the realm of Niecro. After his long recovery and reassignment in a war of lost causes, Luke found himself in league with two high-caliber warriors with equal losing streaks. The three men formed an alliance forged in the fires of survival and trust.
When they encountered the Z from Lukes past, he gives them clues to uncover his destiny with the hope of changing the future. The three men journeyed in opposite directions to collect the items and regrouped to reveal their findings. Luke recognized their significance and pieced together what he had long forgotten." />
