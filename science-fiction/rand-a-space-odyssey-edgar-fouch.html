Rand receives unusual help, from an unusual source - Oracle. With Oracle&#39;s help, Rand&#39;s abilities are &quot;augmented&quot; with technology  but Rand wins a rematch without using his &quot;enhancement&quot;.

This struggle reveals the existence of a weapon of vast power, which Rand and his compatriots must act to disable before it is too late...
