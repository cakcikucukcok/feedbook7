  <title>Edo’s Awakening: Stories of The Conscious Dreamer Series - Sharolyn G. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Edo is a Dream Traveler on the verge of completing his mission from his gods and ascending to the next caste. However, when things go wrong with his mission on Earth, Edo is held responsible for this potential failure. As punishment, he&amp;rsquo;s stripped of his caste privileges. Edo, who only knows life as a Traveler, quickly finds himself at the mercy of his Helper, Danyu, for assistance navigating this new world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As he spends time in Danyu&amp;#39;s world, Edo sees a side of life in the compound that&amp;#39;s foreign to him. Though Danyu tries to keep him in the dark about what&amp;#39;s happening, the little he does see makes him question his own life. Once he starts to question everything he&amp;#39;s believed was true, can Edo go back to being who he was before his punishment?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This novella takes place before the events in &lt;i&gt;The Heaviness of Knowing&lt;/i&gt; and can be read as a standalone novel." />
