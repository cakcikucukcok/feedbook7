  <title>Revelation: Book 1 of the Legacy&#39;s Child Series - M.L. Chrisman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Like most people, Irina Gorski has a past. A past that she wants to keep secret. She had fought in the war against Emperor Lalani where she was a member of a secret military organization call the Arcanum Mortis. Her job was to do the impossible tasks which usually required a flexible set of moral standards. A job in which she excelled. It has been 15 years since the end of the war, and she is now a Maintenance Chief on an out of the way research station. The job is fine with Irina because all she wants to do is raise her daughter, Pearl. Her biggest fear is her daughter finding out about her past.   Things are fine for her until one day a terrorist group called the Brotherhood decide that they are going to make her remote out of the way planet their new home world. Now she has to use her training to try to stop the Brotherhood and save her daughter as well as the researchers and their families. Irina wonders which is harder, keeping secrets or raising a teenage daughter." />
