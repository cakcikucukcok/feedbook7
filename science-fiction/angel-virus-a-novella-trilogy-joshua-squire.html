  <title>Angel Virus: A Novella Trilogy - Joshua Squire</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Up until the day the Angel Virus appeared, people of the world thought they knew the meaning of true terror. After all, they&#39;d seen thousands of years of war, starvation, illness, and other forms of tragedy. Yet, the emergence of the Angel Virus brought about a deeper level of sorrow and a fiercer degree of trauma than any living person had dreamed existed.   On the day the Virus came, all over the world, children suddenly began to die. The virus inflicted great grief on humanity, but humanity would not have time to mourn. A war between good and evil was soon to heat up. The Angel Virus is only the beginning of a battle that carries much more than earthly implications. This is a divine confrontation in a world buckled by despair, where the laughter of children has been silenced forever." />
