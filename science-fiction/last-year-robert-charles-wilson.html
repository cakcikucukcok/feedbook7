  <title>Last Year - Robert Charles Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Two events made September 1st a memorable day for Jesse Cullum. First, he lost a pair of Oakley sunglasses. Second, he saved the life of President Ulysses S. Grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the near future of Robert Charles Wilson&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Last Year&lt;/i&gt;, the technology exists to open doorways into the past--but not our past, not exactly. Each &quot;past&quot; is effectively an alternate world, identical to ours but only up to the date on which we access it. And a given &quot;past&quot; can only be reached once. After a passageway is open, it&#39;s the only road to that particular past; once closed, it can&#39;t be reopened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A passageway has been opened to a version of late 19th-century Ohio. It&#39;s been in operation for most of a decade, but it&#39;s no secret, on either side of time. A small city has grown up around it to entertain visitors from our time, and many locals earn a good living catering to them. But like all such operations, it has a shelf life; as the &quot;natives&quot; become more sophisticated, their version of the &quot;past&quot; grows less attractive as a destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesse Cullum is a native. And he knows the passageway will be closing soon. He&#39;s fallen in love with a woman from our time, and he means to follow her back--no matter whose secrets he has to expose in order to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
