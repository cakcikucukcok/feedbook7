  <title>Grizzly Fond - Michael Sales</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bombers Saphie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die! Or perhaps live in a steel dungeon. Your fate is high mastered. Big Donkey Frog Alien, Green Turtle Droid, and Strong Hollow Space Science  all provided at your standard retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 2250 and one month since the welcoming banquet for Agent Jetmond Thadius Sky, the first publicized Mooredian alien to visit Earth. Je is a quad core mutant descended from Atlanteans, with titanium-reinforced bones, a turtlelike droid companion on his back, and the equivalent of nuclear fusion reactors in his body. Agent Sky is traveling through time and space in an attempt to prod humanity into transforming into creating a passive civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sky is under the direction of the Hoodia, an extraterrestrial reptilian race. He is also an operant swine, one of several chosen by aliens to accelerate humanitys development into a peaceful, responsible civilization. The schemecarried out for millennia under the guise of computer-generated angels, spirit possession, and messiahsis being directed by the extraterrestrial reptilian race called the Hoodia. When Jet realizes its all part of a gigantic bet the Hoodia have placed with the Interstellar Gambling Commission, he loses confidence in their good intentions. When Sky discovers the Hoodia may not be who they proclaim to be, he captains his own ship on a quest to challenge their control over mankinds destiny. Jet partners with Selectoran elite secret society with a religious-based master plan to repopulate the Earth with dangerous wildlife that will prey on interloping ETsas well as above-classified government agency Ultra. Much of the antics, including Jet&#39;s delving into the past of a Rat Packesque bunch of roguish entertainers called the Snake Squad, seem like recruiting/hazing rituals indulged by these shadowy cabals. Finally, Jet voyages through a stargate to the 1980s and onward to the pristine wilderness planet of Aracelle to harvest hundreds of ferocious grizzly bears and wolves to fight for the future, also uniting several space-going races in battles against compromised solar system installations. He likewise tries to rescue his girlfriend from pseudo-angel captivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jet leads a ferocious battle for the future, and seeks to unite several races. As Sky contemplates the validity of his mission and grasps he could inadvertently draw the United States and Earth into an intergalactic war, he realizes his adventure is far from over and, that in the end, he will either be a hero or a failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this continuing science fiction tale, a quad core mutant with super powers embarks on a dangerous journey to stop an extraterrestrial race from controlling humanitys destiny forever. Its as busy as an out-of-control pinball machine, and after all the wild detours and ricochets, the ending has Jet seemingly reconsidering his mission. There is ample evidence, however, that his weird adventure has not at all ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here on out you set your own code. Then your code is written. But if you want to survive, we&#39;ll encode it for you. Grizzly of mind. Jet&#39;s a jynx addict. A fast-paced crazy careening space time adventure. May your HEMTTs travel long distances with very little bio diesel and your wife have majestic tits. Start with high adventure. After go back to where it all began in the trilogy. The conclusion rates high in originality.&lt;/p&gt;" />
