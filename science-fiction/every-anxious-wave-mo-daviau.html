  <title>Every Anxious Wave - Mo Daviau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Good guy Karl Bender is a  thirty-something bar owner whose life lacks love and meaning. When he  stumbles upon a time-travelling worm hole in his closet, Karl and his  best friend Wayne develop a side business selling access to people who  want to travel back in time to listen to their favorite bands. It&#39;s a  pretty ingenious plan, until Karl, intending to send Wayne to 1980,  transports him back to 980 instead. Though Wayne sends texts extolling  the quality of life in tenth century &quot;Mannahatta,&quot; Karl is distraught that  he can&#39;t bring his friend back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter brilliant, prickly,  overweight astrophysicist, Lena Geduldig. Karl and Lena&#39;s connection is  immediate. While they work on getting Wayne back, Karl and Lena fall in  love -- with time travel, and each other. Unable to resist meddling with  the past, Karl and Lena bounce around time. When Lena ultimately  prevents her own long-ago rape, she alters the course of her life and  threatens her future with Karl. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-spirited and engaging novel, &lt;b&gt;EVERY ANXIOUS WAVE &lt;/b&gt;plays  ball with the big questions of where we would go and who we would  become if we could rewrite our pasts, as well as how to hold on to love  across time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
