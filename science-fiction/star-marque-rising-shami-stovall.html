  <title>Star Marque Rising - Shami Stovall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future is governed through a genetic hierarchy&amp;mdash;superhumans at the top, humans and defects at the bottom. &lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to an all-new military science fiction novel from critically-acclaimed author Shami Stovall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clevon Demarco, a genetically modified human, has a cocksure attitude and the combat skills to back it up. With his unparalleled skills, he makes his living as a ruthless gunrunner on a shady space station near the edges of the quadrant. Stronger, faster, and wittier than most sad sacks, no one even comes close to Demarco&amp;rsquo;s abilities&amp;mdash;until he crosses paths with the captain of the notorious &lt;em&gt;Star Marque&lt;/em&gt;, Endellion Voight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Captain Voight arrests Demarco and offers him a choice: go to a prison planet for his crimes, or join her starship, &lt;em&gt;the Star Marque&lt;/em&gt;, working as mercenaries for the superhumans. But she didn&amp;#39;t pick him at random. She has a plan to become a planet governor; a title no human has held since the superhumans won the war. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter the cost&amp;mdash;assassinations, extortion, blackmail&amp;mdash;she&amp;rsquo;s determined to claw her way to the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Captain Voight needs is Demarco&amp;rsquo;s help to carry out her machinations, and she&amp;rsquo;ll give him everything he&amp;rsquo;s ever wanted in return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A fast-paced space opera for those who enjoy Old Man&amp;rsquo;s War by John Scalzi, Revelation Space by Alastair Reynolds, or anything by Robert A.
