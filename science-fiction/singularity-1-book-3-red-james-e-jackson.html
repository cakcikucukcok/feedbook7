  <title>Singularity 1 Book 3 Red - James E. Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Following his salvation of the Homo Colossus species, and several other even more endangered species, Wil established an empire that became known as the Celestian Empire after a long naming competition sponsored by Wils and Jens ship, &lt;em&gt;Firefly&lt;/em&gt; who turned out to be canny investor. Numerous species on hundreds of planets participated in the competition, with the ten million dollar prize being won by a teen-aged human girl from the original Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Empire grew powerful under Wils strong leadership. Wil kept his hareem, including his sister Jen, and his great aunt Ruth and his grandmother Glee and his favorite mother, Rika. He had two hundred five mothers in all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The harem was extended by five additional female giants, Stephanie, Emmanuelle, Constanza, and Arabella and Brigitte. This took the total in numbers to seven hundred twenty five, but the gain from the giants was greater because each was nine meters tall, and each was dedicated to Wil alone. Their brother, Michael, was one meter taller. Not all of the concubines were Wils mothers. Wil made few more girls. Instead, the Imperial Palace rang to the sound of growing boys and girls fathered by him at first, and then by his male offspring. He imported some new boys, humans and Gideonese, but mostly HCs. Amber repaid Aisha, and to some extent Wil, by showing Aisha the secrets of her double vagina. With a specialized womb for boys and another for girls, Aisha at last had real children, of both sexes, fathered by Wil. The last seventeen confiscated concubines joyously took service contracts which pledged lifetime bonds to Wil, although not so strongly as the giants pledge. Male giants were too big to penetrate other species.&lt;/p&gt;" />
