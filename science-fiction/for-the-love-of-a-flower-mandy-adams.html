  <title>For the Love of a Flower - Mandy Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The life of the Rose family has always been simple and sweet but Rose&#39;s mother and father know that when it is Rose&#39;s turn to rule the Woods Kingdom she will have to face fairies who will question her authority and she will have to go to war with the Unimaginables. Will Rose defeat the creatures or will these things destroy the Woods and take over making the fairies run from their homes and be nothing more but something that used to be great. It seems that nothing Rose does helps her with this war.    The King and Queen, known all her life as her mother and father, hid a secret from Rose and everyone in the kingdom. Will she choose to forget and neglect her family or will she embrace it and forgive her &quot;parents&quot; and move on to more important matters like what is to come. The fairies depend on Rose to win the war or fairies will be gone forever.    In the middle of the war Rose realizes something that will change her life forever and if she gets hurt that future could change." />
