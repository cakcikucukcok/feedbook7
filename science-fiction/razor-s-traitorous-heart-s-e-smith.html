  <title>Razor’s Traitorous Heart - S.E. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An alien warrior is supposed to forge a peace, but all he really wants... is her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We sent messages into space to find out if there could be someone out there, listening. Then six years ago, Trivators came to Earth. They wanted to bring Earth into the Alliance of Star Systems, but worldwide there was such violent panic at the unexpected visit that the Trivators were forced to take control. It&amp;rsquo;s not going well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Razor is a High Chancellor for the Alliance who has been sent to finally bring order to Earth &amp;ndash; by any means necessary. Chicago, a city torn apart by two factions, is an extremely important target to quell the chaos, and it is there in Chicago that a female warrior saves his life and disappears.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kali has devoted her life to her brother&amp;rsquo;s cause. After all, Destin is the only one has Chicago&amp;rsquo;s best interests at heart. Colbert just wants power, and he certainly has become a powerful enemy. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t always that way. Once he was someone they trusted above all others, but that time is past, and now Kali will do whatever it takes to bring peace to their people, even if that means battling giant alien warriors who stuck their noses into Earth&amp;rsquo;s business six years ago and never left. One night though, Kali sees someone who will die if she doesn&amp;rsquo;t act, and then discovers mid-rescue that he&amp;rsquo;s a Trivator!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Razor has never failed a mission, and his reputation of ruthlessness is well earned, but for the first time in his life, he finds himself torn between duty and something he is unfamiliar with, his heart.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Internationally acclaimed S.E. Smith presents a new action-packed story full of adventure and romance. Brimming with her signature humor, vivid landscapes, and beloved characters, this book is sure to be another fan favorite!&lt;br /&gt;
