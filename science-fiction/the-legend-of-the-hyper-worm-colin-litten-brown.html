  <title>The Legend of the Hyper-Worm - Colin Litten-Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="His relationship in tatters and heading for self-destruction, William Corder feels as if he has no purpose in life. Little does he know that across the galaxy alien beings are taking a strong interest in his destiny. Believing the human to hold the key to an incredible secret they hire Gideon Blank to track Corder down and discover what he knows, aided by clues in an ancient book that mysteriously predicts exactly what Corder will do.
The Earth is in the grip of a global depression, employment is rare. It is only through the support of his benefactors in the Avery-Hart Institute and his few friends that Corder clings on to his job as his world collapses around him. When the opportunity comes to travel to Egypt Corder sees it as a means for him to begin the slow process of rebuilding his life emotionally. The trip, like his boss is not, however, all it seems and yet everyone seems set on Corder making the journey.
Out in the desert something waits which will hurl Corder into an adventure beyond his wildest imagination, far away from the world he knows, as he becomes embroiled in The Legend of the Hyper-Worm." />
