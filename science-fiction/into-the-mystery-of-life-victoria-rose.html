  <title>Into the Mystery of Life - Victoria Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The planet Gareth is being destroyed as three sisters prepare to leave. They agree to travel in one bodyCrystals. She takes the energy spirits of Poni and Zoe into herself, reduces her body to radio-light waves, and travels through space towards earth. Arriving via sunbeam, she materializes on the naked back of sunbathing Mac Dakota, aka Alleycatmac.
Into the Mystery of Life: Tetralogy is a four-part series in one novel. Former Navy SEAL Mac Dakota, Comanche Indian Hawk, and Sheriff Thomas Day are the chosen men who enjoy the special gifts, abilities, and unique sexual attitudes of these alien woman. After obtaining IDs, clothes, and jobs, the sisters decide to use their gifts and shape-shifting abilities to enhance their personal financial situation as well as reduce drug trafficking in their community. The three couples decide to form a crime-fighting team and take on the evil Lilith Saitan, Princess of Hell, High Priestess of Dambala.
Crystal tells us why Gareth has no government, no religions, no doctors, hospitals, crime, or jails. Zoe tells us about their education, means of exchange, extended family, and why they use hydrogen as their energy source. In other words, Into the Mystery of Life is significantly more than a simple sci-fi romance." />
