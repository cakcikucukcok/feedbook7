  <title>Malfunction - Nina Croft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Investigator, Sergeant Logan Farrell, has never been convinced the human race deserves saving. But it looks like he&#39;s got the job anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been five hundred years since we fled the remnants of a dying Earth in search of a new home. Twenty-four ships, each carrying ten thousand Chosen Ones. All sleeping peacefully...until people start dying in cryo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malfunction or murder? Hopefully, the former--a serial killer in the fleet would be drastic for morale. But Logan is determined to find the truth. Unfortunately, he&#39;s got a new partner--and he works best alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katia Mendoza, hot-shot homicide detective, has been woken from cryo to assist with the investigation. But is she really interested in solving the case, or does she have her own agenda?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before he can answer that question, though, they become targets themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing like a few near misses with death to bring a couple together, and Logan finds himself falling for the alluring detective. But he doesn&#39;t know that Katia is hiding a secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not only humans who fled the dying Earth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
