  <title>Inner Thoughts - David Mas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="LIFE ON EARTH IS FAR FROM PERFECT. THATS WHY ELDERS OF THE PLANET OGAN, A PERFECT world populated by intelligent trees, have sent Ogos there. His mission is simple; eradicate pain and misery.
From his landing spot in a city park, Ogos watches the world go by; creating a zone of peace and comfort around him that touches everyone who steps into his cool shade. A group of park-goers adore the tree that never wilts, and they find themselves consistently drawn to Ogos, who has the power to cure their minds and their bodies. It seems that Ogos can cure everything, from homelessness to illness. But there is one thing that Ogos does not have the power to change, and that is his own isolation, for as a tree, he cannot experience the same life as his newfound friends. 
On this new, imperfect planet, how can Ogos make a difference and be truly happy? So, he found a way to become human. This is a story about kindness, about selflessness, and togetherness in a world that insists on the opposite." />
