  <title>Chosen - Miranda Storm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bonds that havent been tested, cant be trusted.
Zephaniah Washington has always fit comfortably in the background. Thats just how she likes it, being part of the scenery. She never steps out to be noticed, constantly staying by her best friend Kais side. Ever since they were little it has always been Kai and Zeph, and thats all shes ever known. Life has taught her that Kai is the only one she can trust. Shes been happy with that existence until she meets Aaron. A tall, smart funny, gorgeous member ,of the academy that she and Kai have just transferred to.
As she gets to know Aaron ,Zeph begins to develop a whole new outlook on life. She starts wondering is it ok to let others into her tightly closed bubble. Then, Zeph has a chance encounter with someone that brings her to the realization that there is something different about her. Something that makes her very special compared to her other classmates. That there is something unique brewing on the inside of her that is about to come to the surface. Some wont believe it, while others will kill for it. Little does Zeph know that those others may be closer than she thinks
Come embark on this journey that will question the bonds of loyalty , friendship, love, courage, and strength. We all have something within us waiting to be awakened. Whats within you?" />
