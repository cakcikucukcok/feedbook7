  <title>Gene Roddenberry&#39;s Andromeda: Paradise Drift - Sherwood Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;R and R Between a Rock and a Hard Place&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dylan Hunt and the Crew of the Andromeda Ascendant have been fighting the good fight to re-establish the Systems Commonwealth. They need some serious rest and relaxation. Fortunately, they arrive at Paradise Drift, an ideal spot for a quick vacation. In the drift, the crew can play at pirates, medieval knights, gladiators--almost anything imaginable--in the virtual gaming scenarios concocted for visitors&#39; pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the drift wishes to join the New Systems Commonwealth, the crew is given carte blanche to enjoy all of the drift&#39;s facilities for free. This is a welcome gift for the weary crew, but it doesn&#39;t take long for complications to arise. First, Trance Gemini vanishes without a trace. Then their tech-wizard Seamus Harper visits a harem, only to be confronted by a woman from his past who has a knife and a score to settle. Even worse, Pilot Beka Valentine is relentlessly pursued by a bounty hunter who desperately wants to claim the price on her head. And Captain Dylan Hunt hasn&#39;t been worrying about his losing streak at a glamorous gambling parlor, until he discovers that gambling debts on the drift are anything&lt;i&gt; but&lt;/i&gt; virtual. Little does Dylan know, he could end up paying for his debts with his head!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, back on the ship, warrior Tyr Anasazi and ship&#39;s AI Rommie are forced to defend the Andromeda Ascendant against aggression from an unlikely source. What follows is an exciting, suspenseful deep-space adventure that will surely satisfy viewers of the TV series and readers with a taste for space opera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
