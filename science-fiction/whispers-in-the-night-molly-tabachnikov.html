&lt;p&gt;They wake him up in the dark, leaving him confused and a little scared. Is it Papa and Daddy talking? From his bedroom in his familys Greenwich Village apartment, he cant quite tell if its his two fathers talkingor someone else. He cant quite make out any words as the voices fade in and out in the darkness. Fox knows, however, that whatever it is isnt speaking out loudand there is something else in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he grows so do his telepathic powers. Fox struggles learn how to control his talents, and he doesnt always succeed. Then, in one horrifying moment of rage that will change all their lives forever, Fox uses his powers to kill a man remotely.
