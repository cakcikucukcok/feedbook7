  <title>Net Force Ten - Scott Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Olivia is just three when her father leaves home and never returns. A few years later, Olivias mother takes her to live with her grandmother. But when her aunt invites Olivia and her grandma to visit them in Vermont, everything changes forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Olivia and her friend, Nicholas, cross a footbridge into Kids World, they attempt to adjust to life in a strange land where everything is run by a computer. After their adventure leads them to make new friends, Olivia and Nicholas trudge back and forth across the bridge between the two worlds, soon discovering life lessons in their former reality. As they are led to create Net Force Ten--a task force for the betterment of all kind--a mirrored entity begins its quest to take over the galaxy, the Internet, and anything else in its way. While Net Force Ten rises up to meet its greatest challenge ever, Olivia, Nicholas, and other members must either become heroes or surrender to an entity determined to achieve dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this young adult sci-fi adventure, a band of unlikely heroes must bravely face a new frontier while battling an evil being who wants nothing more than to take over the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
