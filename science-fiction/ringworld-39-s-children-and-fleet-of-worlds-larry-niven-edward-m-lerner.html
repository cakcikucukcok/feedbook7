  <title>Ringworld&#39;s Children and Fleet of Worlds - Larry Niven, Edward M. Lerner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two masterworks of science fiction at one low price, from award-winning authors Larry Niven and Edward M. Lerner!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ringworld&#39;s Children&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Ringworld is a landmark engineering achievement, a flat band three million times the surface area of Earth, encircling a distant star. Home to trillions of inhabitants, not all of whom are human, and host to amazing technological wonders, the Ringworld is unique in all of the universe. Explorer Louis Wu, an Earth-born human who was part of the first expedition to Ringworld, becomes enmeshed in interplanetary and interspecies intrigue as war and a powerful new weapon threaten to tear the Ringworld apart forever. Now, the future of Ringworld lies in the actions of its children. All must play a dangerous game in order to save Ringworld&#39;s population and the stability of Ringworld itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fleet of Worlds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is two hundred years before the discovery of the Ringworld. Humanity has been faithfully serving the Citizens for years, and Kirsten Quinn-Kovacks is among the best and the brightest of the humans. She gratefully serves the race that rescued her ancestors from a dying starship, gave them a home world, and nurtures them still. When a chain reaction of supernovae at the galaxy&#39;s core unleashes a wave of lethal radiation that will sterilize the galaxy, the Citizens flee, taking their planets, the Fleet of Worlds, with them. Someone must scout ahead, and Kirsten and her crew eagerly volunteer. Under the guiding eye of Nessus, their Citizen mentor, they explore for any possible dangers in the Fleet&#39;s path--and uncover long-hidden truths that will shake the foundations of worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
