  <title>The Dawn of Man - Elbert Lewis Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A clash of galactic empires,&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;An ancient alliance in crisis and defeat, &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A desperate plan for survival, &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Dawn of MAN &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In 50,000 BC the Reiign was an ancient race with a far-flung galactic empire when cave men roamed the earth.
 Their golden age spanned many millennia and brought their philosophy of peaceful co-existence and technological
 exchange to many sentient species and solar systems in their spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy. Their march towards
 universal self-determination was shattered by an invading menace from the Large Magellanic Cloud. The clash of equally
 ancient but diametrically opposed cultures left the Reiign, a race genetically cleansed of most aggressive tendencies for
 many thousands of years, facing annihilation. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Desperate situations breed desperate measures A group of scientists escaped to the last frontier of the galaxy.
 In a last ditch attempt to save their empire and culture, they devised a stratagem to defeat the invaders. Their plan, 
a 50,000 year genetic breeding project, results in the creation of the perfect warrior, a biological construct bred for 
aggression and genetically optimized for war; a being sociologically conditioned to the shedding of blood on a mass
 scale, the ultimate killing machinethey created MAN! &lt;/p&gt;" />
