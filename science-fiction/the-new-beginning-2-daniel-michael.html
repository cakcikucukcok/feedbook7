  <title>The New Beginning 2 - Daniel Michael</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A future America in the midst of rebuilding after a thirteen-year war is forced to relocate into massive hovering skyscrapers to avoid a government-created epidemic. Alexander James, war hero believed to be the driving factor behind the victory over the invaders, is against the mass relocation commanded by the United States government. Protestors of the relocation on Relocation Day are causing disturbances that end in massacres of American citizens by their own military.
Alexander James is able to avoid relocation with his family. While in route to a location to reunite with former soldiers from his old unit from the war, his family is captured and moved to one of the relocation centers and given a living space on one of the sky scrapers. Temporarily separated from his family Alex begins the creation of The Resistance, a force created to deliver the country from the now-tyrant president that declared martial law after the massacre.	
After assigning leadership, Alexander James decides to turn himself in, in order to use his celebrity status given to him during the war to try to convince the president to return the freedom of choice to the American people and return power to the other two branches of government. While attempting to convince the president, Alex realizes that not only does he have no intention of freeing the American people, but he has begun to implement horrific policies that slaughter anyone who stands against him, as well as the handicapped and the elderly in order to ease the burden on the economy of the society he has created.
Alex now must implement his own plan to make an escape for his family from these government prisons and get word to the resistance that a rebellion is necessary. He soon realized that the only possible way of escape for his family may end in his own demise. Choosing to sacrifice himself if necessary, Alex decides that for the good of the American people and the safety of his family, he would take the risk." />
