  <title>Belvedere - David Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dear readers,
What can I tell you about Belvedere? Hes an old soul and an honest man. He knows the hardships of
the world better than most, and hes watched it deteriorate for years. Now he stands to defend it, and
in this dark time he calls upon you for help. He asks that you read these pages with an open mind
and heart. Hes sacrifi ced everything to bring you this information, and there will be many more
sacrifi ces to come. This book may have been labeled as fi ction, but only to protect its true nature.
What you are about to read is very real. There are many forces that will stop at nothing to keep him
silent. A war is upon us now, and Belvederes time is limited.
Belvedere has begun a quest to expose a very dangerous and problematic truth; one that can
potentially determine our fate. For his own safety, his identity remains a mystery, but in order to
secure the preservation of our world, Belvedere must put himself in grave danger to uncover this
truth. In a race against time, hell protect the one thing that he wants to see destroyed more than
anything else: a mystical medallion that has devastated his own life, and also the lives of everyone
hes ever cherished. This medallion is the only thing that stands between our salvation and extinction.
If it falls into the hands of our enemies, they will wield the power to eradicate our species. Hes
offering these pages to you as a means to prepare you for the battle ahead. As you read, youll learn
the secrets of the medallion, but also why those secrets must be kept safe. The time for retribution
is at hand, and the time to lead is now.
