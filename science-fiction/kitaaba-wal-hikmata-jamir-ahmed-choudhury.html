  <title>Kitaaba Wal-Hikmata - Jamir Ahmed Choudhury</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;Kitaaba Wal-Hikmata&#39; is an inspired sharing at the appointed time. It shares for the First Time in the History of Pen-Paper-Pencil Epistemology those Manifest Truths which are being concealed historically from mankind in general. Due to concealment of Manifest Truth and Projection of Manmade Falsehoods within the domain of Epistemology by the International Criminals as well as their Agencies &amp; Institutions, we [almost all save International Criminals] are far from clear concepts [Self-evident Truths] of Upright Rectangular Universe, Manifested Hexagonal World within Non-luminous Moon of the East Horizon, Appearing Pentagonal Earth, Sirius Binary System [Trinity], Three Ascending Stair Ways, Four Cardinal Directions in resemblance with Four Basic Forces &amp; in correspondence with Crucified Sign, Equal &amp; Opposite Manifested Sign of Sole Magnetism [Two Clear Proofs] from North to South &amp; South to North, Equal &amp; Opposite Moons [Uranus &amp; Neptune] of the Equal &amp; Opposite Zones, Right Direction of performing Salat [Namaz] facing each other towards Upright West [Arsh], appointed day of observing Idd uniformly, Upright West Region of the Appointed Kaba, Straight Middle-East Region of Bermuda Triangle, existential imports of Nine Tokens given to Muusaa (ass) i.e. projected nine planets, and the like. It is self-evident that we know nothing after having known much due to Projected Epistemology. Consequently, we are living under Man-made Nature and are fighting to liberate animals from Manifested Nature. 
Each searched out Manifest Truth shared in the Kitaaba Wal-Hikmata will appear either contrary or contradictory to uncountable pen-paper-pencil works and mechanical activities prevailing in the History of Projected Epistemology. Kitaaba Wal-Hikmata published by Partridge Publishing, 2016, is the first pen-paper-pencil work [self-published book] in the History of Epistemology which not only explores with experimentum crusis and crucial instances the Trinity of Manifest Hypocrisy  Teleological Evidence Sorcery  Extreme Epistemic Persecution, 6310 Conspiracy Commentaries of the researchers of IFTA on Quran in resemblance with Introduced Manmade Magnetism &amp; Invented Circular Rotation &amp; Revolution System of NASA, Nexus of Self-evident Plagiarisms prevailing in the so-called research works etc. but also shares Manifest Truth [Injiil in correspondence with Tawraat] with reference to verifiable truth of facts [Real Science] and justifiable necessary truth [True Philosophy]. 
As &#39;Kitaaba Wal-Hikmata&#39; shares Irreversible Manifest Truth searched out on the basis of Four Revealed &amp; Established Criiterions [Units / Scales] of Truth in resemblance with Universal Major Premises [Coded Shared Tautologies], so, it is beyond scepticism. Sceptics of Irreversible Manifest Truth are instructed to commit Suicide. Projected impact factors, API Points, pentagonal star marks, citations, criticisms, critical remarks, critical reviews, commentaries, Peter Singers concept of liberation, John Rawls Veil of Ignorance, John Lockes Tabula Rasa, Copernican Universal Mal-observation, Keplers Elliptical Axis, Astronomy, Mysticism, Spiritualism, Sufism, Rucksack of According to etc. have no existential imports with respect to searched out Irreversible Manifest Truth shared in the Kitaaba Wal-Hikmata. On the contrary, Kitaaba Wal-Hikmata has proclaimed Greatest War or Jihade-Akbar against International Criminals who have concealed Manifest Truth from the domain of education and have projected Manmade Falsehoods as Manifest Truth within the domain of Education in the name of Scientific Certainty. 
So, Kitaaba Wal-Hikmata rightly deserves verification, justification, recognition, and confirmation of the searched out Manifest Truth [Injiil in correspondence with Tawraat] for the Sanctity of Education, Utilitarian Liberation, Survival of the Truest. If the possessors of Balanced Good Sense are able to point out lacunae in the Logical Thread of the searched out Manifest Truth with reference to criterions of truth and in resemblance with at least one Universal Major Premise [Coded Shared Tautology], the sharer of &#39;Kitaaba Wal-Hikmata&#39; will try to research Manifest Truth from that pointed lacunae. In this regard, the sharer of &#39;Kitaaba Wal-Hikmata&#39; places &#39;Justifiable Appeal&#39; before all to reject or to recognize the searched out Manifest Truth shared in his book for the First Time in the History of pen-paper-pencil Epistemology. 
Further, going through Kitaaba Wal-Hikmata, each possessor of Balanced Good Sense will be able to recognise International Criminals as well as their Equal &amp; Opposite games with Faith &amp; Belief of Mankind in general and particularly with the equal &amp; opposite Right Path towards Upright West &amp; appointed Day of observing Idd uniformly. It is certain like Cogito Ergo Sum of Rene Descartes that the Day when the capability of the possessors of Balanced Good Sense to Approach Justness will manifest openly and publicly, that Day Kitaaba Wal-Hikmata will get triumph over projected falsehoods.
Expecting Justness from the Respective Authorities, Honourable Chairs, Epistemic Persons, Educated People, Possessors of Balanced Good Sense, and Mankind in general with searched out Manifest Truth and Solidified Solid Human Rights shared in the Kitaaba Wal-Hikmata, 
Jamir Ahmed Choudhury
