  <title>Return of the Kachinas - Margaret Vivienne Currie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;For as long as anyone can remember, the legend of the kachinas has given hope to the people. These teachers from the stars shared their wisdom with ancient humanssecrets that have helped the human race thrive against all odds. Present day Earth is in trouble. Stripped of her resilience by generations of reckless abuse of her natural resources, all signs point to an impending disaster beyond imagination that threatens all life on Earth. The fate of the planet may hang in the efforts of a few special humans.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Abigail, a New Zealand grandmother and writer, has been asked to make a record of what could be humanitys last days. In Australia, a forest regeneration expert named Danny may be the key to rebuilding Earths ecosystem. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Hordea, a benevolent extraterrestrial with the knowledge to save the planet, appears. He invites Abigail and a select group of chosen humans to join him on the mothership for an educational adventure to other worlds. But in the middle of their wonderful journey, the mothership hurtles out of control due to nuclear fallout. Admontwalia, the leader of the visitors, explains that they need to train their passengers to harness their own mental abilities to guide the ship back to Earth.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When they return, their worst fears are realised. The planet has shifted off its axis, the coastlines of the Earth are submerged, and new land has arisen from the waters. Once again, humanity looks to the wisdom of the kachinas to save their world.&lt;/P&gt;" />
