  <title>The Fates - James W. Hoddinott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Fates follows societys search for immortality. The exploration of what each of us would sacrifice if it meant that we could live forever. Changing societal values and reducing the importance of community has resulted in a society that continues to put the needs of the individual first. The Fates explores a society made up of those that put their needs ahead of all others versus those that believe the spiritual self is the destiny of all humans. The conflict in a society and each individual that devalues the basic human characteristics that make each of us unique manifests itself in some devastating outcomes.
Each day we are faced with decisions of what each of us value and what each of us will fight for. The youth of today are influenced by increasingly uncontrolled and self-centered ideas about how they should live. The path is being set in our world where through media, we are changing culture. The Fates at one time may have seemed like science fiction; however, with our increasing knowledge of genetics and our belief that immortality can only be obtained through science rather than spiritually or through the legacies we create to make our world a better place for future generations." />
