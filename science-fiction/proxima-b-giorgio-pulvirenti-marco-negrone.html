  <title>Proxima B - Giorgio Pulvirenti, Marco Negrone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One day not too far from now there will be too many people on this planet. When that day comes, what will we do? Jerry, Michael, Emily, Amelia, Abigail and David receive their answer in the form of a letter. Proxima B is waiting for them and is going to expose their differences and their fears, which will let them make unexpected choices. Sometimes, a more obvious answer is not more predictable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Co-authored science fiction novel about a space mission that leads a group of colonists to land on Proxima b, which is an exoplanet in the habitable zone of the red dwarf called Proxima Centauri and whose distance from the sun is 4.24 light years. The year is 2099. Due to world&amp;#39;s pollution, the excessive number of inhabitants, the subsequent lack of resources and other reasons, Earth is no longer fit to live in. The only hope is to try to reach what appears to be a &amp;rdquo;second possibility&amp;rdquo;, Proxima b, indeed. This is why New Nasa Corporated is planning a mission called &amp;rdquo;For everyone&amp;#39;s sake!&amp;rdquo; that imposes the recruitment of several practitioners in their own field, including biologists, doctors, chemists, engineers and soldiers. These include Jerry, Michael, Emily, Amelia, Abigail and David, in addition to Matthew Ross, who is the captain of one of the three mother ships (the MATERs) that after the &amp;rdquo;new colonizers&amp;rdquo; have been trained leave Earth and manage to reach the new planet through a wormhole. But during space travel something does not go as planned. Terrestrial beings find something different from what they expected on Proxima&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
