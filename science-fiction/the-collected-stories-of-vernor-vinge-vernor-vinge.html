  <title>The Collected Stories of Vernor Vinge - Vernor Vinge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since his first published story, &quot;Apartness,&quot; appeared in 1965, Vernor Vinge has forged a unique and awe-inspiring career in science fiction as his work has grown and matured. He is now one of the most celebrated science fiction writers in the field , having won the field&#39;s top award, the Hugo, for each of his last two novels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, for the first time, this illustrious author gathers all his short fiction into a single volume. This collection is truly the definitive Vinge, capturing his visionary ideas at their very best. It also contains a never-before-published novella, one that represents precisely what this collection encapsulates--bold, unique, challenging science fictional ideas brought to vivid life with compelling storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including such major pieces as &quot;The Ungoverned&quot; and &quot;The Blabber,&quot; this sumptuous volume will satisfy any reader who loves the sense of wonder, and the excitement of great SF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
