  <title>Hello Norman - Karl Iams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Norman Riley is unhappy with his planetary mission to characterize mundane rock formations on the desolate Hossa. But this is not the first disagreement between Norman and his employer, the young and brash Jason Alcott of Alcott Enterprises. As Norman concludes that his assignment is a convenient way for the Alcott family to put both him and his spaceship out to pasture, he is propelled into a new territory without any idea of what lies in store for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making a startling discovery on Hossa, Norman must jump into action to ensure an important secret is kept safe from human exploitation. Unfortunately, Norman soon realizes Jason has different ideas. Convinced by Normans sudden departure from his companys payroll that he is being tricked out of a valuable ore find, Jason sends his best team to Hossa to reclaim what is rightfully his. Now only time will tell if Norman can pick up the gauntlet and somehow save the day, not just for the universe but also himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this science fiction tale, an unlikely hero is propelled on the journey of his life after he makes a shocking discovery on an isolated planet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
