      <meta name="description" content="EVIL RISES IN NORTH KOREA: The Hunt for Chosins Lost Treasure begins with the Norths invasion of South Korea on June 25th, 1950, which initiated the Korean War. The war resulted in the lasting enmity and mutual distrust between North and South Korea up to the present day. Kim Jon-uns rogue state represents a harsh reality for the Western world. This book uses the historic framework of the Korean War to launch a fictional tale of a vast treasure lost during the famous battle at North Koreas Chosin Reservoir in 1950 and discusses the evil of the Norths familial leadership and their unending quest for power and control of the Korean peninsula. EVIL RISES IN NORTH KOREA presents many heroic figures, including a synthetic man who saves the free world from an imminent nuclear threat posed by North Korea and her allies." />
