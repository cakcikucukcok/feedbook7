  <title>Mylok: - Thorpe E. Wright V</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How did the pyramids around the world come into existence? Who can explain the mysterious vanishings within the Bermuda Triangle? Only one man knows the true answers and his name is Mylok.
Abducted by a race of superior alien beings, Mylok learns to use his mind and body to go far beyond the limits of any human. Through technologies far greater than our own, Mylok is given the gift of remarkable life extension. By a computer of alien design, known as the Tzorb, Mylok gains access to all knowledge.
Unbeknownst to herself, an American woman holds the key to the survival of the earth. In their desperate search, Mylok shows the young woman a world unlike anything she could have ever imagined. Myloks pet, a half man/half dragon creation with an IQ of 182, helps the woman to blend into Myloks futuristic world.
In the hopes of saving the earth from certain destruction, Mylok and the woman fall in love. However, can the relationship last with a woman in her early twenties with a man of some five thousand five hundred years of age...and can the earth survive?" />
