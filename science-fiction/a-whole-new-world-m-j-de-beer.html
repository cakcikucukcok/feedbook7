  <title>A Whole New World - M.J. De Beer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is the year 2047. When a huge 110 mile wide asteroid  hurtling towards Earth  is discovered by Eddie Thompson, the governments of the time realize the devastating implications for the future of mankind. They put their differences aside to work together in secret, trying to devise a means to remove the threat of this asteroid, but also a means to escape Earth should their best efforts fail. A colonizer ship is constructed in out of sight of the public behind the moon, and no expenses are spared. 
The last nuclear warheads are placed on ballistic missiles and launched to either deflect or destroy the asteroid  named Derak  but in the end their plans fails miserably and in 2054 it crashes into India, ending all life. Nothing survives the apocalyptic disaster. But not before a hundred and forty thousand carefully selected people escape on the first interstellar ship ever built  the Genesis  and head towards a known Earth like planet discovered earlier around a far away star. In Genesis, the last survivors of humanity travel for sixty years at near light speed and in deep sleep until they arrive at the new planetary system of 10 Tauri, where they find against all odds a new Earth teeming with life, and here they take on a fantastic adventure of colonizing this new world, set in a Jurassic type era. When one of the landing shuttles crash in a remote jungle, their survival is complicated by the discovery of two primitive civilizations at war" />
