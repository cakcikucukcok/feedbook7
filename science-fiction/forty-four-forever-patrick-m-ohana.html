  <title>Forty-four Forever - Patrick M. Ohana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if your life didn&#39;t go on as it&#39;s programmed to, restarting at specific times in your past, repeatedly? What would you do after your initial shock subsided somewhat? What would you do after you had done all the obvious things you could do? Louis finds himself in such a predicament, leaping back into his past, struggling to comprehend what&#39;s happening to him. He seeks some passing solace in the company of individuals who had marked his life--from Elvis Presley to Steve Irwin--sadly, all of whom had died too early but whom he attempts to save one way or another. Dedicated to Ken Grimwood and ultimately to longtime travel, this novel tries to intimate and cope with many of its inherent problems, especially death and immortality, two extremes that seem to lack a common ground." />
