  <title>All Around the Moon -  Jules Verne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the conclusion of his book &amp;quot;From the Earth to the Moon&amp;quot;, written in 1865, Jules Verne left his readers&amp;mdash;and his astronauts&amp;mdash;hanging in the starry ether. The readers had it the worst, since Verne forced them to wait five years before he resolved the plot complications in his sequel &amp;quot;All Around the Moon&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Picking up where &amp;quot;From the Earth to the Moon&amp;quot; left off this sequel follows the first lunar explorers in a dangerous journey around the moon. The world&amp;#39;s first 3 space travellers, Impey Barbicane, Michael Ardan and Captain Nicholl attempt to become the first men on the moon, but their journey is fraught with mishap. Will their trip succeed as they attempt to dodge asteroids and realise that the scientists on Earth have miscalculated their trajectory towards the moon?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;All Around the Moon&amp;quot; is an engaging, well-written story. From where we are today if you consider it from the time it was written and everything we have developed along the way since, it is an amazing science-fiction book, a visionary masterpiece.&amp;nbsp;" />
