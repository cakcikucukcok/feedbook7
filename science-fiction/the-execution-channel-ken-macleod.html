  <title>The Execution Channel - Ken MacLeod</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s after 9/11. After the bombing. After the Iraq war. After 7/7. After the Iran war. After the nukes. After the flu. After the Straits. After Rosyth. In a world just down the road from our own, on-line bloggers vie with old-line political operatives and new-style police to determine just where reality lies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Travis is a British patriot and a French spy. On the day the Big One hits, Travis and his daughter must strive to make sense of the nuclear bombing of Scotland and the political repercussions of a series of terrorist attacks. With the information war in full swing, the only truth they have is what they&#39;re able to see with their own eyes.
