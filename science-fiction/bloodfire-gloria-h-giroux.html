  <title>Bloodfire - Gloria H. Giroux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Decades before the bitter war of independence between Ptolem and Osiron end, two royal brothers grow into manhood while on a path intended to define the history of their family and their world. Shayne and Sar-Chay, born to the most powerful Kindred on Osiron, are groomed and indoctrinated in the ways of the Separatae, a fiercely determined
group that demands nothing less than independence from their increasingly totalitarian motherworld, Ptolem.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Despite their deep fraternity, mutual respect, and love, Shayne and Sar-Chay are too different in spirit and goals to maintain a tranquil relationship. As their differing concepts of love and loyalty to the women in their lives pit them against one another, the brothers battle in equally desperate desires to control the lynchpin of their next generation, the warrior Vin-Chay. As the men prepare for the deciding conflict to gain Osirons independence, they clash with one another in a relentless cornucopia of hate, vengeance, passion, and unwavering determination.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The souls of three men precariously balance on the precipice of obliteration as the final battle nears, and all three are forced to make decisions that will either save them or destroy everything they hold dear.&lt;/p&gt;" />
