      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Overprescribing modern antibiotic type medicines and so-called wonder drugs, together with modern intensive agricultural methods have ended in common viruses, such as influenza and others, that have been able to be treated and controlled over the past decades are now spiraling out of control with new strains gaining a foothold in the world population. This being due to the body&#39;s natural immune system failing to fight these viruses. A crisis has developed all over the globe; therefore, a team from Worldwide Pharmaceuticals Ltd have been tasked with finding a solution in combating the out-of-control viruses and stop the plight and demise of mankind on earth.&lt;p&gt; 
Meanwhile, a parallel team headed by Jim Kent at Transaerospace are working on the highly confidential Star Chaser 451 project for the United States and United Kingdom governments, which have been working secretly together on various scientific and military projects since the end of World War Two. On its completion, the Star Chaser craft becomes a valuable tool in helping to save mankind from its demise, in a very unsuspecting way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
