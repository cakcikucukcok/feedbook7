  <title>Hero Veterans Vs. the Veterans Administration - Clint Dean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many people see VA Hospitals, saying Veterans have it made with free health care. Most all of the people saying this would be shocked that the Vets, would trade their VA medical card for your private insurance card, in a flash.&lt;br&gt;
The VA, also charges many Vets, a co-pay, will bill the insurance if a vet has or has been put on his wifes insurance and bill Medicare or Medicaid. Somehow with all these collections when viewing the VA, budget, doesnt seem to be a factor, the VA, says its cost continues to skyrocket. Also, when viewing the VA, budget submission to Congress, the travel expenses are enormous, but; cant seem to decipher where that is either. One should understand the VA, Secretary, is a presidential cabinet officer. Therefore he has to travel with security and Secret Service protection, and a travel voucher. He is reimbursed per diem, exorbitant amount for meals and hotels. The government plane is on the taxpayers, and pilots and security. I assure you he does not stay at motel 6, or budget inn.&lt;br&gt;
The travel expenses alone for the Secretary and executive staff, Regional Directors from around the U. S., could adequately compensate and take care of Vets, by the 100s.&lt;br&gt;
If the Secretary and his executives are concerned they would in Washington, and fix the VA. They do release a lot of press releases if read you would think that the VA, runs smoothly, however; please dont be fooled, they are press releases, example; the VA, is going to hire an additional 1900 employees for mental health. Wow, that was six months ago, and looking daily at the Government website, USAjobs.com  or .gov, there is NO postings. The good ole VA. This organization is a super classic propaganda machine as only a vet experiences. Many programs are announced, few get fully implemented.&lt;br&gt;
When traveling, the VA, secretary, visits VA hospitals, when he approaches and asks how you are doing, have any problems, do you think he remembers 5 minutes after he leaves your bedside. Two years have passed and I have heard nothing about a problem I brought up to him, can the wards get cleaned on a regular basis? Nothing happened and no replies. Thanks Mr. Secretary!&lt;br&gt;" />
