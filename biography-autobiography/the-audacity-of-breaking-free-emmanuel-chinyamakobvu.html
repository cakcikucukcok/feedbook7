  <title>The Audacity of Breaking Free! - Emmanuel Chinyamakobvu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Audacity of Breaking Free!
The Audacity of Breaking Free is a recollection of the time I spent in the war fighting for the liberation and independence of Zimbabwe and the following events long after that war. I have tried to be as realistic, honest and true to the events as they happened according to my recollection more than three decades later.  I did not have any notes written during the war or after, as a consequence, my minds eye is likely to see things differently from others who went through the same war or similar experiences of that war. I have used many quotes attributing them to certain individuals, but again all these quotes are from my memory and therefore may be remembered differently from others recollection. Experiences in the war were mentally troubling for me and many others who were directly and indirectly involved in it.  The rural population had no better fate as they were often caught in the cross fire or assaulted for lending support to the war.  Long after the war the day to day life did not seem to mean anything anymore for war veterans like me.
