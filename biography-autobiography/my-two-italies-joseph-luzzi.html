  <title>My Two Italies - Joseph Luzzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A poignant personal account from a child of Calabrian peasants whose lifelong study of Italy unveils the mysteries of this &lt;i&gt;Bel Paese&lt;/i&gt;, &quot;Beautiful Land,&quot; where artistic genius and political corruption have gone hand in hand from the time of Michelangelo to &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sopranos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The child of Italian immigrants and an award-winning scholar of Italian literature, in &lt;i&gt;My Two Italies&lt;/i&gt; Joseph Luzzi straddles these two perspectives to link his family&#39;s dramatic story to Italy&#39;s north-south divide, its quest for a unifying language, and its passion for art, food, and family.&lt;br&gt;     From his Calabrian father&#39;s time as a military internee in Nazi Germany--where he had a love affair with a local Bavarian woman--to his adventures amid the Renaissance splendor of Florence, Luzzi creates a deeply personal portrait of Italy that leaps past facile clichés about Mafia madness and Tuscan sun therapy. He delves instead into why Italian Americans have such a complicated relationship with the &quot;old country,&quot; and how Italy produces some of the world&#39;s most astonishing art while suffering from corruption, political fragmentation, and an enfeebled civil society.&lt;br&gt;     With topics ranging from the pervasive force of Dante&#39;s poetry to the meteoric rise of Silvio Berlusconi, Luzzi presents the Italians in all their glory and squalor, relating the problems that plague Italy today to the country&#39;s ancient roots. He shares how his &quot;two Italies&quot;--the earthy southern Italian world of his immigrant childhood and the refined &quot;northern&quot; Italian realm of his professional life--join and clash in unexpected ways that continue to enchant the many millions who are either connected to Italy by ancestry or bound to it by love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
