  <title>Now Go and Teach the People - Joseph A. Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book its self is about my own experience of remembering where I came from before child birth its self.
I had been in side of such a beautiful and heavenly place before going through child birth its self.
I was in this heaven like area its self at the time.
I did not know of such things as Hunger pains, Or thirst.
Nor did I know of such things as needing to relieve such things as the bodys sudden urges of the bathroom its self then.
I was of a spiritual form yet here and did not have that one of a mortal body its self.
Those things is what this book is about for me here.
In this place as well for my self.
I had no such things as mortal parents for me either.
Those were chosen for me at the time by a higher person of authority.
The higher authority was father tm then, Who had sent me to a mortal life on this earth then.
I believe with an unknown mission.
In the bible we are first taught that we are all born of a spirit body by father in heaven.
Then second we are born to parents here on earth to obtain a mortal body as well.
That is what this book is based on here.
With me telling you the story of my own life.
This is not prebirth memories just by them selves.
This is the real deal for me here.
And true and factual knowledge for me of what I actually had went through its self to get in to this life its self.
Along with pains as well in various parts of the trip its self.
That is what this book is about.
So personally by this true experience of my own here.
I can tell you all.
Yes that heaven is very real and that spirit children are very real as well before the mortal life its self.
And that there is also father in heaven to us all.
This book is based on true facts and very real experience to my self here." />
