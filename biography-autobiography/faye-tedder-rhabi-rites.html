  <title>Faye Tedder - Rhabi Rites</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ive always thought that if something went wrong, it was my fault, said Faye as we began our journey together as interviewer and subject.  As I approached this frail woman who as of lately, has been through quite an ordeal, she began to smile while tears streamed down her face.  Stop that, said her husband, Alex, of 40 years.  He knew just how much this biography meant to Faye; the full meaning of the interview brings tears to Fayes eyes.  I greeted her and sat down in the chair beside her bed.  As I looked all around the room, I couldnt help but notice all of the machines that were placed there to help her breathe and to monitor her respiratory system.  One has to understand that Faye was suffering from COPD, a condition that makes it hard to breathe and worsens over time.  I have heard a little about COPD from TV commercials and others who were suffering with it, but what I didnt know was you could actually recover after it seems that all hope was lost.  Well this was one of those times.  After a long struggle with asthma and COPD, and after several visits to the hospital over the years, Fayes family was told that she would not make it.  In fact, all of the family was called-in because just a few days prior Faye was brought home from the hospitalto die.  She had made her last visit to the hospital and wanted to die at home.  
Troubling as this may have been, her family agreed and Faye was taken home.  Several days had gone by and Fayes condition was not getting any better as was expected.  Flowers and cards were sent and prayers were offered from everyone who knew her.  When her husband Alex called the family to their house, he felt as if he knew deeply that he was about to lose the most important person in lifehis wife. 
 It seemed inevitable that Faye would pass but as to when, they did not know.  All they knew was they needed to be there, loving and giving support to the woman who had given their family life.  What they didnt know at the time was she would live beyond that night.  They know now." />
