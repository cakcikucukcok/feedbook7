  <title>Break and Run - Bobby Hodge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For the average young black man growing up in the
southern United States during the 60s was to realize
that the oppressive Jim Crow laws that dehumanized
and degraded black people and their ancestors of the
past, was still very much enacted and very active in
and around Crawford. A southern rural Community
approximately 10 miles west of Phenix City, Alabama
the unchallenged idea of prevalence in the white
society had uncompromising and terrible physical
rebuttal for its victims.
Bobby L. Hodge, Jr. Has attempted to illustrate a
very diabolical but realistic fiction depicting the life and
times of Jesse Hodge during the tremulous times of
his life, Faced with oppression, Jesse was rebellious
and criminally cunning. Determined by his fate to live
a life on his own terms, he constantly found himself in
a desperate attempt to elude the law, but his less
than evasive karma surrounding the life in which he
had created for himself was too great to overcome" />
