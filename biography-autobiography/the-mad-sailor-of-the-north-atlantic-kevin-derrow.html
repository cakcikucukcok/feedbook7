  <title>The Mad Sailor of the North Atlantic - Kevin Derrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Mad Sailor of the North Atlantic first wrote poetry and wrote songs, a short story came into the mix in college for a creative writing class, and somewhere along the line he began writing vignettes. This book opens with the vignettes, subtly wrought pictures in words tracing the Mad Sailors journey from there to here. I had always intended for my music to be a part of this book, but you will have to settle for finding my music on Face Book, Reverb Nation, and Sound Cloud. I have left breadcrumbs to follow if you would like a copy of my CD. I have always wanted to be a writer, and for almost fifty years I have been writing the book you now hold in your hands. Some of these moments were brutal, breaking me and reassembling me, forcing me to places I never imagined existed as I looked at the trail early in my traveling. Most of the things I found were a wonder, and I have done the best I could to hand you the seeds that grew the bridges the Mad Sailor learned to cross. I have grown up with this book, and casting it upon the waters of the high lonesome wind is a hard thing. We sail our seven seas, solitary and all at once joined, letting the currents and winds do what they do. Thank you for taking a chance on the Mad Sailor and the winds that brought him home." />
