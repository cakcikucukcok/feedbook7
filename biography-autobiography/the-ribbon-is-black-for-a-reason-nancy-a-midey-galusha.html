  <title>The Ribbon Is Black for a Reason - Nancy A. Midey Galusha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1997 Jerry Galusha had a mole removed from his back left calf. The mole had changed which caused concern. It was biopsied and determined to be malignant. The mole was surgically removed and after a short recovery period it was all but forgotten. Yearly skin and lymph node checks kept his concerns about melanoma at bay until an unusual, relentless pain in the back of his head led to an MRI that unvailed the horrible truth; Jerry had stage IV metastisized malignant melanoma. His cancer had spread, undetected, all throughout his body over the course of that 13 years. Jerry&#39;s illness taught his friends and family the meaning of unconditional love. This is the story of the love, support, courage and devotion of a family and community to Jerry Galusha during the 4 months of the remainder of his life; a life that was cut short from malignant melanoma." />
