  <title>The Origin of Agbogugu (Agbogwu Oshie Aneke) - Sir Cletus C. Nwafor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am inspired to write this book for our youths and for posterity. This book has been written to give values to life of the youths who, otherwise, would not have known what happened far back before their great-grandfathers up to fourth to fifth generation. This will help them to give values to life and to know what was noble and what was traditionally an abomination so that it will guide them to fashion their lives, achieve what is noble, and die peaceful deaths. This book also aims at showing that there is very little difference between a worthy Christian life and an ideal traditional life. What is good for the gander is good for the geese. Good and evil exist whether one is a Christian or a traditionalist. God exists, and the belief is nearly the same to both religions. What is different is the mode of worship." />
