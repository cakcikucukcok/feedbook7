  <title>The Lisbon Lions - Alex Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Lisbon, on 25 May 1967 footballing history was made when Celtic became the first British team to win the European Cup. Against all the odds, the Scottish side had beaten the might of Inter Milan 2-1. Remarkably, in the forty years since that amazing achievement, the Lions&#39; thoughts about that special time have never been brought together in one book - until now. In The Lisbon Lions, the eight surviving members of that famous team - Billy McNeill, Jim Craig, Tommy Gemmell, John Clark, Willie Wallace, Stevie Chalmers, Bertie Auld and Bobby Lennox - offer their memories of the games leading up to that wonderful day in Lisbon, relive the excitement itself and reveal how winning the European Cup changed their lives. As entertaining in print as they were on the field, their exclusive inside stories are told with humour and a real sense of pride. And, with tributes from the players to their late team-mates Ronnie Simpson, Bobby Murdoch and Jimmy Johnstone and their incomparable manager Jock Stein, The Lisbon Lions is a must-read for football fans everywhere." />
