  <title>Searching for Barton Carter - Nancy Barton Carter Clough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1936, Barton Carter, a talented young man from a wealthy New England family, turned away from the future laid out for him to fight against Fascism in the Spanish Civil Warand disappeared in the midst of that fight when he was only twenty-three years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter had just been jilted by his English fiance two weeks before their wedding when a Spanish Nationalist acquaintance asked him to travel to Barcelona to retrieve some of his familys possessions. Carter jumped at the chance for an adventure and a change of scene. During his two-week Spanish sojourn, his beliefs were radically changed by exposure to the countrys civil war, driving his involvement in Communisma political movement in opposition to everything for which his family stood. He also found himself working with Spanish orphans and serving as the administrator of four orphanages, where he saved the lives of thousands of children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This narrative biography explores the life of a young American who saw the horrific effects of Fascism on the children of Spain and responded with bravery and dedication to rescue them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
