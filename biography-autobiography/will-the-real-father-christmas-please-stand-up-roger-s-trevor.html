  <title>Will the Real Father Christmas Please Stand Up - Roger S. Trevor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="SUMMARY &lt;br&gt;
Will The Real Father Christmas Please Stand Up&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The author enjoyed several years as a professional Father Christmas in a major capital city department store.
During those years, he meticulously recorded details of the best of hundreds of visits he had to the infamous Santa den.
He was prompted by his employment agency to publish these records, but it has taken him 15 years to do so.
Now, for the first time, he is presenting the public with a unique record of many of those intimate events in his own inimitable style and laced with some philosophy about attitudes towards Father Christmas.
The book delivers nothing but true events and leads the reader through every stage of a Christmas season, but presenting them in an interesting personality format, rather than a straight diarised version.
The humour, sadness, delight and despair are all here in this one true record of Santa interviews and the reader will undoubtedly recognise themselves somewhere in the pages, whether it really is them or not." />
