These stories, along with the telling of her own personal experiences, assist us in viewing our own experiences generated by our students as potential stepping stones to luminosity on our own evolving journey, whether it be as an educator, student or as an adult. In turn, we become aware of how we too, can build from the lessons learned by the young, the children of our future.
