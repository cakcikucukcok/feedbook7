  <title>Miracles Among Chaos - Bella Louise Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Miracles among Chaos is my story of childhood abuse, my struggle with mental illness, and the journey I walked through to find love, hope, faith, and finally myself. My book is one that will give readers a roller coaster of emotions as they turn the pages. The greatest gift I can give to you in reading my story is the gift of forgiveness. In order for any of us to move forward in our own journey, we must forgive those who have hurt us. I had an early experience with death, and it set me up for a lifelong struggle with faith in God and why we all are here. As I struggled with my faith and my mental illness, many miracles occurred along the way are sure to help even the biggest skeptics open their minds and their hearts to the fact that there truly can be miracles among chaos.
Miracles Among Chaos is a fascinating read. While it is a very personal account of one womans journey through abuse and chemical imbalance, it is also inspirational and relatable to anybody that has had to rise above their circumstances. Bellas story travels through family secrets, devastating losses to battles with obesity. Bella is a survivor whose story needed sharing!
