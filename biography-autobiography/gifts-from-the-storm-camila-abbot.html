      <meta name="description" content="Camila was an unhappily married mother of three when her oldest child was diagnosed with cancer. This tragic event sent a shockwave throughout her existence, propelling her upward, out of her disappointed complacency in life, and into a broader realm of examination. It would call her to question all her previous beliefs, beginning with the true nature of love. Once this portal of exploration was opened, she began to hear a voice whispering through it to hera voice not of this world but of the spiritual dimension. This voice, she realized, had been whispering to her all her life, trying to guide her on her journey toward truth though, in the cacophony of societal distractions, she had unfailingly ignored it. In the midst of a tumultuous inner storm, it spoke to her once more, through the open door of her griefbut this time, she was able to listen. Weaving through the emotional landscape of personal experience combined with the ethereal wisdom of a spiritual presence in our lives, this book has the power to help readers reimagine their own personal struggles within the scope of a wider dimension: a dimension that is always available to us as a guide. You will finish reading this book with a feeling of having expanded your awareness and with a deeper understanding of love and its power to transcend all thingseven death." />
