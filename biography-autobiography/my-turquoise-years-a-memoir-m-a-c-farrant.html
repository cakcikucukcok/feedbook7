  <title>My Turquoise Years: A Memoir - M.A.C. Farrant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;My Turquoise Years&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; is a touching, funny, and elegantly written account of a 13-year-old girl&#39;s life. Throughout her childhood, &lt;B&gt;Marion Farrant&lt;/B&gt; had heard stories of the sophisticated life her mother, Nancy, led aboard cruise ships and in Australia. The exotic world of furs, jewels, cigarette holders, and handsome men seemed miles away from the west coast hamlet where Marion lived with her aunt and uncle, running wild on the beach with her friends and enjoying weekend visits with her devoted father. But things changed the year she entered her teens. First, a package arrived from her mom &amp;#151; a gift of sexy lingerie. Next, Nancy threw everyone into a tizzy by announcing that she was coming to visit!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With affection and wry humor, Farrant remembers her own impetuousness and sarcastic attitude as a teenager, and perfectly captures the emerging counterculture of the early-1960s.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
