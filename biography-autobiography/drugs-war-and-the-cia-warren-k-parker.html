  <title>Drugs, War and the Cia - Warren K. Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book includes the true story of one man, caught up in the secret war in Cambodia, Laos, and North Vietnam and even into Southern China. The fighting was hard, with no quarter given by either side, men died without anyone knowing their true names, just code names.
It describes in detail how the Central Intelligent Agency (CIA) paid for this secret war, without receiving money approbated from our US Congress. Drugs were a way to the end, as time went on the CIA became the largest drug dealers in the world. Shipment of Herion to the United States was on weekly basis with their own private Airlines called Air America, Continental Air, Bird and Son airline, Arizona helicopters and many more small airlines owned by the CIA, nick name for these airlines was called Opium Air by the men that saw what was happening.
The CIA went so far as to ship drugs to South Vietnam to be sold to our own troops on the ground. It is documented  there were on the average two deaths from overdosing of drugs by our military per day. There were untold numbers that died in combat for being high on the CIA supplied drugs and untold numbers that died when they came home.
This book details the story of some of the greatest fighters and pilots in the world gathered in these small countries. The CIAs had their own mercenary army made up of Americans, Australians, New Zealanders, English, French,  South Koreans, Hmong and Cambodians . Unlike the war being fought in South Vietnam where there were rules of engagement, in this secret war there were no rules anything went whether it be the use of poison gas, biological weapons or the paying of bountys for body parts of the enemy whether it was men, women or even children.
There were total disregard for the Geneva Convention which the US was a signature to. Everyone there was using expanding bullets in their weapons.
Our own CIA were above reproach, no one would challenge them, they were much worse than the enemy we were fighting. The death and destruction still remain in Laos. With unexploded bombs and vast mine fields, that were never mapped and recorded. The sad thing, I was part of what happened and like all of the others, never spoke up." />
