  <title>They Called Me Cochise - John Leslie Fultz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When soon after I started to meditate, I seemed to find myself inside of the beautiful birds body, flying so free. It was a beautiful feeling, the feeling of free flight, and I was able to fly wherever I wished and when suddenly I returned to my own body, there underneath the tree, I felt like a new person. I felt as if I was one with all that surrounded me in nature.&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
                                The Fearless Falcon
   &lt;p&gt;
                      Where time is lost and truth begins,&lt;br&gt;
                         the chains are finally broken. &lt;br&gt;
                          All without you find within, &lt;br&gt;
                    once scarred and tangled, now silken. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
                     The worldly lust that pained once so, &lt;br&gt;
                        seems now just an ancient token. &lt;br&gt;
                         The Fearless Falcon flies so high, &lt;br&gt;
                          True love can never be broken. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I read Cochise and I congratulate John!&quot; &quot;Cochise&quot; is free, beautiful, interesting and full of surprises. It is sensitive and able to fully convey the spirit of an era, the hippie generation. An enjoyable universal crossroad, John Leslie Fultz, Cochise for European basketball fans, is a psychedelic author, who writes as creatively as he scored baskets. His  college rivalry with the great Julius Dr. J Erving, adventures with the late, great John Belushi, his friendship with Italian singers Vasco Rossi and Lucio Dalla and his teammates, Claude English and Dino Meneghin are all included! &lt;br&gt;
Luca Maggitti- Journalist and Writer. Conducts basketball TV programs. Journalist for Il Tempo since 2001. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They Called Me Kociss is an intense, fast paced, vibrant story. It is pure, sincere and honest like the man who decided to write it always was both during happy and difficult times. A great and important message that should be beneficial to the new generation. It is story that is not only for those who love basketball!
