  <title>Lloyd L. Nash, Sr. Essays and Remembrance - Delois Nash</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As for religious background and
training, the Nash family was Baptist.
Regular a endance was a must. The paternal
grandfather was a Baptist preacher and
two of his boys, uncles of Lloyd, were also
ministers in the Baptist Church. Lloyd was
fi rmly grounded in moral values. He says he
has never tasted alcohol and when he saw
boys about to get into something that looked
like jail, he got out of there fast.
I have known brother Nash since 1976
when he held a meeting where I preached in
Owensboro, KY. Since then, he has preached
meetings everywhere I have preached and I
have been privileged to conduct a number of
meetings where he has labored in the gospel.
One sister observed a er hearing brother
Nash, Hes the preachinest man I ever
heard! I tend to agree with that assessment." />
