  <title>My Search for My Vietnam Scout Dog Prince - Ed Reeves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After training for five months at Fort Benning,&lt;em&gt; Prince&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ed Reeves&lt;/em&gt; worked as a point team on patrols in the jungles of Vietnam. They ate together, slept together, sloshed through rice paddies together, walked up and down mountain trails in the heat and monsoon rain together, and flew in choppers together.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When Ed&amp;rsquo;s tour was up and he got to go home, the hardest part was saying goodbye to &lt;em&gt;Prince&lt;/em&gt;. He had to stay. Ed thought about him all the time, wondering what happened to him. When the troops were pulled out in 1973, Ed gave &lt;em&gt;Prince&lt;/em&gt; up for dead. He just wondered how. How did he die? Was it fast in the heat of a battle, or was he euthanized because he was considered excess equipment? Or the worst fate&amp;mdash;was he turned over to the South Vietnamese Army? For 36 years Ed had those questions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In 2007, he found out what happened!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
