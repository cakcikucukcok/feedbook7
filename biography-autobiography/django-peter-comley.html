  <title>Django - Peter Comley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On safari with a small dog with a big heart. Django was named after a fictional hero of the Wild West when as a six-week-old pup he taught the local bully a lesson. After a narrow escape from the life of a pampered lapdog, he found himself free in the Okavango Delta of Botswana. Django travelled southern Africa&#39;s wildest and most picturesque areas, nose to the ground, head out of the car window, or sometimes tactfully concealed from head to tail in the handbag of Peter&#39;s wife Salome. To this pint-sized but charismatic character elephants were equals: his courage and understanding of the wild saved the lives of a number of his human companions, sometimes more than once. Django is an entertaining safari from Botswana to Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, crossing the Okavango Delta, going hunting with Kalahari Bushmen, and exploring the Namib Desert, Victoria Falls and the wilds of the Zambezi. Ever since Jock of the Bushveld was first published, stories about man&#39;s best friend in the wild have entranced and entertained both locals and international visitors alike. Django promises to do the same." />
