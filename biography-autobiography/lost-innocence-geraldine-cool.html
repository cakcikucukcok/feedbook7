  <title>Lost Innocence - Geraldine Cool</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lost Innocence is the unforgettable account of a childs life, who was sexually, physically and mentally abused. Through her struggles you will feel her pain, her loneliness and fighting for her life.
Imagine a young girl forced into submission and ordered to perform adult acts. Her own possession: loneliness and fear.
Im still here after years of you trying to break me. One day youll see, I will make something of myself.
Geraldine Cool tells of the courageous and moving story of her abusive childhood.  Here is a horrifying glimpse of what went on behind closed doors. It is her touching account and testament to the strength of the human heart and its capacity to triumph over unimaginable trauma.  She had nothing and no one to turn to  but her dreams kept her alive. Dreams of one day being loved, honored and cherished by a special angel.
Experiencing the instability of three foster homes, a detention home and a mental hospital. People thought foster kids were nothing but trouble and unworthy of being loved just because she wasnt part of a Real Family&quot;. Forced to suffer shame.
Devastation, tears and hope create the journey of this severely abused child." />
