  <title>Untouchable - Jacob Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From Dickens and Dostoyevsky through to Capote and Norman Mailer, great authors have wrestled with the criminal mind; and now Jacob Miller, one of the best new authors in America, puts his pen to this task in a work that is both riveting and engrossing.
Can anything get through to the criminal sociopath, or is he truly untouchable?  Follow the life of Frankie Moreno from his earliest encounters with death in La Perla, Old San Juan in the late 1940s, to his childhood experiences as a victim in El Barrio, East Harlem, New York, to his own early criminal activities, his gradual rising through the ranks and his eventual arrival as the leader of the Untouchables, one of the most feared Latino street gangs in Harlem.  From that point the story follows Frankie as he manipulates a position for himself as an associate of the Pleasant Street Mob, under the leadership of the Godfather of one of the Five Families, Thomas Lucchese, then follows Frankies increasing activities with the Mafia as a major drug dealer intimately involved with the French Connection, to the Pizza Connection and finally, to the Columbian Connection.  Finally the story shows Frankie breaking out and starting his own family by reviving the Untouchables but now structuring his operation after the Mafia.
Along the way, Frankie serves hard time in maximum security prisons, commits gruesome murders and runs every racket under the sun.  It is only after his own narcotics addiction brings him down that Miller leads us to Frankies compelling conclusionhow after Frankies multiple failed attempts to conquer his addiction, finally, late in life, he becomes a Jehovahs Witness, ultimately conquering his addiction to drugs and shedding blood.
This remarkable and tensely exciting tale of unspeakable horror will leave the reader as unnerved and invigorated as the Godfather movies and Carlitos Way." />
