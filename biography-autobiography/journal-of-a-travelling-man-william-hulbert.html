  <title>Journal of a Travelling Man - William Hulbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I graduated from the University of Michigan and went directly into the U.S. Navy as the Korean War was still on. I served two years on a Destroyer as a Gunnery Officer. Upon discharge I went into the financial management business, where I spent most of my career. I walked out of the office at age 56, never to return and flew to Paris where I got an apartment and stayed for several months. I had been to Paris several times as a tourist, but this was an entirely new experience. I wrote about half of a political novel, but discovered that politics at home was over taking me and put it aside I have always traveled starting by going over the North Atlantic on a merchant ship carrying 750 horses to Poland at age 16. Iwent across the South Atlantic and up the West Coast of Africa at 17. I have been through the Panama Canal in both directions. When I sent up my personal information I forgot one important item. I have been married to one woman(forever young) since we were children. We have four sons which includes one set of twins. 
While I grew up in Washington DC. I went to the University of Michigan for my college education. I wrote stories for the college newspaper and helped start a humor magazine. I graduated into the Korean War and ended up as the gunnery officer on a destroyer. With my love of the water, I live on the banks of the Chesapeake Bay." />
