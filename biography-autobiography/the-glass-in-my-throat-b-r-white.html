&lt;BR&gt;
ABOUT THE BOOK AND AUTHOR:
&lt;BR&gt;
=================
&lt;BR&gt;
25 plus years after graduating high school, I have enjoyed much success working for fortune 500, fortune 100, and fortune 50 companies as a Programmer, Fiber Optic Engineer, Financial Securities Broker, Operations Executive and successful entrepreneur. Today, I am a top tier technology executive, author and radio show host. My journey over the years has taken me far beyond where I was as a kid and into areas of business and personal achievement I could never have imagined.
&lt;BR&gt;
As a kid, like many other poor black kids, I watched TV to find images of success that looked different from neighborhood success where were people doing well (surviving) but working four jobs, dealing drugs, reselling stolen goods and living on welfare. The only problem with watching TV is, the shows only provide you the end result of someone being a business executive, lawyer or doctor with very little information on how to make it happen. As a result, many young black kids identify with sports figures that make it rich because the sports plan seems simple and clear play good ball, go pro, and get rich.
&lt;BR&gt;
Unfortunately, I never played a sport well enough to make millions so I had to figure out how to make it through life as a regular guy coming from a poor neighborhood. To help others, I documented the details of my journey and provide the raw scoop on many of the highs and lows of my experience as they relate to financial planning, education, family, relationships, racism, and much more. I outline what happens behind the scenes of becoming a black executive.  
&lt;BR&gt;
Release 2.0 provides some additional insights and outlines how regular people (most of the population) can find success with the right information and attitude. In addition to the intimate personal documentation, The Glass In My Throat has Personal Cookbooks which are designed to help our kids and parents focus on the basics that truly drive success. The cookbooks also provide information on making it through college, operating as an executive, and becoming an entrepreneur.
