  <title>Visions From The Past - Veronica  Voncile</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Voncile and her brother Lenard never knew their mother or father. They lived with their grandmother Lillian until one night a strange man killed her while they slept just a few doors away. The two were taken from the only home and family they ever knew. After their grandmother&#39;s murder in Alabama, the children were sent to live in a place called Texas with a woman they were told was their great-grandmother. With her world spiraling out of control, Voncile&#39;s brother was her last hold on reality. Then he was abruptly snatched away from her by someone who was supposed to be a man of God, but turned out to be the devil himself. Voncile experienced evil at an early age from two men her great-grandmother trusted. Murder, deceit, lost innocence, and the separation from her beloved brother pushed Von to the limits. How much could a child endure, and how will these things affect her future?" />
