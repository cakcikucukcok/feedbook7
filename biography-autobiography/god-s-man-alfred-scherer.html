  <title>God’S Man - Alfred Scherer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alfred Scherers path to his true self and calling was not an easy one. His childhood was one of struggle, both personal and physical. Soon, the small, weak child learned to flex his intellectual muscles and curiosity. When a dedicated high school biology teacher took the bright young man under his wing, Alfreds potential took flight. He followed his destiny to become a healer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he heard a still, small voice in his head, he knew his life was about to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He followed that internal guidance and soon, with Gods help and support, became a doctor. &lt;i&gt;Gods Man: The Tales of a Reluctant Doctor&lt;/i&gt; shares the story of Alfreds life, education, love, and career. During his four decades working in hospitals and small towns, he wrestled to forge productive relationships with other doctors and the medical-political system and all its minions. His was an adventure into saving lives, as well as a journey into understanding himself and his relationship with God. His memoir details how God directed his life and created a success out of imminent disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfreds story is proof that out of the turmoil is born a man who comes to understand himself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
