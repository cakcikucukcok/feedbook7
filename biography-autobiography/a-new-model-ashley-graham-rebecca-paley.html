      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Evocative.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;The Cut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the most outspoken voices gracing the cover of magazines today encourages women to be their most confident selves, recognize their personal beauty, and reach for their highest dreams in this wise, warm, and inspiring memoir.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voluptuous beauty Ashley Graham has been modeling professionally since the age of thirteen. Discovered at a shopping mall in Nebraska, her stunning face and sexy curves have graced the covers of top magazines, including &lt;em&gt;Cosmopolitan&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;British Vogue&lt;/em&gt;, and she was the first size 14 model to appear on the front of the wildly popular &lt;em&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/em&gt; swimsuit issue. The face of brands such as H&amp;#38;M Studio, she is also a judge for the latest season of &lt;em&gt;America&amp;#8217;s Next Top Model. &lt;/em&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s only the beginning for this extraordinary talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashley is leading a new generation of women breaking ground and demolishing stereotypes, transforming our ideals about body image and what is fashionable and beautiful. A woman who proves that when it comes to beauty, size is just a number, she is the voice for the body positivity movement today and a role model for all women&amp;#8212;no matter their individual body type, shape, or weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this collection of insightful, provocative essays illustrated with a dozen photos, Ashley shares her perspective on how ideas around body image are evolving&amp;#8212;and how we still have work to do; the fun&amp;#8212;and stress&amp;#8212;of a career in the fashion world; her life before modeling; and her path to accepting her size without limiting her dreams&amp;#8212;defying rigid industry standards and naysayers who told her it couldn&amp;#8217;t be done. As she talks about her successes and setbacks, Ashley offers support for every woman coming to terms with who she is, bolster her self-confidence, and motivates her to be her strongest, healthiest, and most beautiful self. &lt;/p&gt;" />
