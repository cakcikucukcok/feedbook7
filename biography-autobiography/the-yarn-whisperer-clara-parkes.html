  <title>The Yarn Whisperer - Clara Parkes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stockinette, ribbing, cables, even the humble yarn over can instantly evoke places, times, people, conversations, all those poignant moments that we&#39;ve tucked away in our memory banks.

--From the preface&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;The Yarn Whisperer: Reflections on a Life in Knitting&lt;/i&gt;, renowned knitter and author Clara Parkes ponders the roles knitting plays in her life via 22 captivating, poignant, and laugh-out-loud funny essays. Recounting tales of childhood and adulthood, family, friends, adventure, privacy, disappointment, love, and celebration, she hits upon the universal truths that drive knitters to create and explores the ways in which knitting can be looked at as a metaphor for so many other things. Put simply, &quot;No matter how perfect any one sweater may be, it&#39;s only human to crave another. And another, and another.+?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&quot;If you are a knitter, or even if you are not, read this book for the sheer joy of her writing, for the way she strings ideas together and brings you into her world . . . I would compare her to Mark Twain because of her dry humor. Honestly, she&#39;s that good.+? --&lt;i&gt;New Jersey Courier News&#39;&lt;/i&gt; In Sticthes blog&lt;br&gt;

&quot;I see a lot of yarn books in this gig, and &lt;i&gt;Whisperer&lt;/i&gt; is not only the best I&#39;ve seen this year, it&#39;s one of my all-time faves. Seriously, it&#39;s that good.+? --&lt;i&gt;The Oregonian &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to stop reading. Each chapter is a little jewel.+? --KnitCircus.com&lt;br&gt;

&quot;Parkes has a poet&#39;s appreciation for the interconnectivity of seemingly disparate aspects of life . . . I have a sense of affinity with the metaphors she chooses, which are drawn from music, gardening, baking, and of course, knitting.

&quot;It&#39;s a fun book for curling up on a cool day with a cup of tea, knitting nearby, of course.+? --CraftGossip.com&lt;br&gt;

&quot;It is seriously the best book about knitting experiences ever. I absolutely LOVED it!+? ­&lt;i&gt; --Sweetly Made &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;If you haven&#39;t read &lt;i&gt;The Yarn Whisperer&lt;/i&gt; yet, you should. It&#39;s sweet, funny and full of moments you&#39;ll recognize or aspire to. I recommend you get a copy.+?&lt;i&gt; --Moth Heaven &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;In this charming series of linked essays, Parkes metaphorically puts the fast whorl on her wheel and spins something entirely new, showing that she&#39;s not just a good writer but a great one. Funny, sweet, and trenchant and offered in twenty-two digestible bits, this book is not only the quintessential sampler afghan of knit lit, it is also the &#39;It&#39; gift of the season.
