  <title>Guys, Goats and Organic Farming - Estelle Curwen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Though there is much about London I dislike, there is nonetheless a lot to do, see, and spend money on. Walking in the rain, though, is free and one of the most enjoyable things London has to offer. There are far less people in the streets, and there are always those who wait at the lights too close to the road and are surprised when a bus rushes past through a huge puddle and their Gucci suits get soaked! It makes me giggle, and I have no qualms about turning and grinning about it to other bystanders. Unfortunately, I do not like umbrellas. I like to feel the rain on my face. Like the wind, its a small reminder of nature in such unnatural surroundings. I say unfortunately, because women in London wont get their well-groomed hair wet, and many women are just the wrong height. If your hair isnt caught in the spokes, or you dont get trodden on because they cant see you, you can be damn sure you get poked in the eye! I actually believe that they are used as a weapon and defence shield all at once." />
