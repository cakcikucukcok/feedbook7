  <title>Irvin S. Cobb - William E. Ellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&quot;Humor is merely tragedy standing on its head with its pants torn.&quot; -- Irvin S. Cobb&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Born and raised in Paducah, Kentucky, humorist Irvin S. Cobb (1876--1944) rose from humble beginnings to become one of the early twentieth century&#39;s most celebrated writers. As a staff reporter for the  &lt;I&gt;New York World&lt;/I&gt; and  &lt;I&gt;Saturday Evening Post, &lt;/I&gt;he became one of the highest-paid journalists in the United States. He also wrote short stories for noted magazines, published books, and penned scripts for the stage and screen. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In  &lt;I&gt;Irvin S. Cobb: The Rise and Fall of a Southern Humorist&lt;/I&gt;, historian William E. Ellis examines the life of this significant writer. Though a consummate wordsmith and a talented observer of the comical in everyday life, Cobb was a product of the Reconstruction era and the Jim Crow South. As a party to the endemic racism of his time, he often bemoaned the North&#39;s harsh treatment of the South and stereotyped African Americans in his writings. Marred by racist undertones, Cobb&#39;s work has largely slipped into obscurity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Nevertheless, Ellis argues that Cobb&#39;s life and works are worthy of more detailed study, citing his wide-ranging contributions to media culture and his coverage of some of the biggest stories of his day, including on-the-ground reporting during World War I. A valuable resource for students of journalism, American humor, and popular culture, this illuminating biography explores Cobb&#39;s life and his influence on early twentieth-century letters.&lt;/P&gt;" />
