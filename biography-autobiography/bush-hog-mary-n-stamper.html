  <title>Bush Hog - Mary N. Stamper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Howdy; I&amp;#39;m Nellie Cake and these are &amp;quot;Memoirs From My Outhouse.&amp;quot; I write adult only, violence, murders, rapes, beatings, and nasty words. True stories of murders, crimes, violence, 36 rapes, drugs, incest, alcoholism, inmates, stolen children, and homelessness. I have forty years of experience in these subjects and forty years of sobriety from drugs and alcohol. I&amp;#39;m an Appalachia inbred Hillbilly and ain&amp;#39;t nothing wrong with that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
People who write similar stories usually are not an inbred Hillbilly which makes my story unique. Names were changed to get family and people from the past to shut the hell up. To be a real smart ass extended family is only mentioned. Hillbillies do make moonshine, grow weed, carry double barrel shot guns, and stay bare-foot. I guess city folk wants me to wash my cover alls more often. We don&amp;#39;t eat the road kill unless it&amp;#39;s soft.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If it&amp;#39;s stiff the dogs get it. Four of my children were stolen like I&amp;#39;m a baby factory, the fifth became an armed bank robber with Jesse James. I was kidnapped, beat and raped at nine then witnessed the same man beat, rape and my two nine year old Hillbilly girl-friends. i witnessed the brutal beating and murder of an elderly man.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My second husband was a wannabe Clint Eastwood carrying and arson, beating on me and hunting me like an animal. Many pregnancies I lived in the snow then many years hitching in snow hunting for them. Drug dealing and exotic strip dancing were a way to survive in the wake of being annihilated by spouses. I dated my home confinement officer and was honored with a Governor&amp;#39;s pardon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My stomach exploded and took a year to walk. Lucifer threw a 16,000 pound building on me causing gangrene and took a year to walk. Worse case of MRSA in history took a year to walk. I maintained employments and continued writing through destitution, pregnancies, savagery, prisons, and northern winters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Life&amp;#39;s accomplishments: I won six turkeys, nine trophies battling cocks, birthed five kids, won ten cakes, and caught nine ten pound Bass. I possess gloating rights to angling stories and jaded memories. I want a place for authors of any genre and victims of any crime to have a voice without family or people judging, preaching, bossing, and interfering.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I understand they are Holier than me, but they make authors of my genre feel we&amp;#39;re a bad image or influence on their precious perfect family. Every story I write is true. If I&amp;#39;m not using real names doesn&amp;#39;t that make it fiction?&lt;br /&gt;
