  <title>Priest, Politician, Collaborator - James Mace Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Priest, Politician, Collaborator&lt;/em&gt;, James Mace Ward offers the first comprehensive and scholarly English-language biography of the Catholic priest and Slovak nationalist Jozef Tiso (1887-1947). The first president of an independent Slovakia, established as a satellite of Nazi Germany, Tiso was ultimately hanged for treason and (in effect) crimes against humanity by a postwar reunified Czechoslovakia. Drawing on extensive archival research, Ward portrays Tiso as a devoutly religious man who came to privilege the maintenance of a Slovak state over all other concerns, helping thus to condemn Slovak Jewry to destruction. Ward, however, refuses to reduce Tiso to a mere opportunist, portraying him also as a man of principle and a victim of international circumstances. This potent mix, combined with an almost epic ability to deny the consequences of his own actions, ultimately led to Tiso&#39;s undoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Tiso began his career as a fervent priest seeking to defend the church and pursue social justice within the Kingdom of Hungary. With the breakup of Austria-Hungary in 1918 and the creation of a Czechoslovak Republic, these missions then fused with a parochial Slovak nationalist agenda, a complex process that is the core narrative of the book. Ward presents the strongest case yet for Tiso&#39;s heavy responsibility in the Holocaust, crimes that he investigates as an outcome of the interplay between Tiso&#39;s lifelong pattern of collaboration and the murderous international politics of Hitler&#39;s Europe. To this day memories of Tiso divide opinion within Slovakia, burdening the country&#39;s efforts to come to terms with its own history. As portrayed in this masterful biography, Tiso&#39;s life not only illuminates the history of a small state but also supplies a missing piece of the larger puzzle that was interwar and wartime Europe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
