  <title>From Orphan to Physician: The Winding Path - Chun-Wai Chan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, Dr. Chan describes how, during the civil war that occurred in China after World War II, his family escaped to Hong Kong, how they survived in utter poverty, and how he went from being an orphan to graduating from Harvard Medical School and becoming a cardiologist. The writing is fluent, easy to read and understand. The sequence of events is realistic, emotionally moving, spiritually touching, heart-warming, and thought provoking. The author repeatedly experienced God&#39;s miracles, enabling him to accomplish much. Yet he constantly hid himself and gave glory to God. The book illustrates a truth that passes the test of time: a successful person must possess diligence, perseverance, humility, and other virtues. But most importantly, one must have faith in order to walk through life&#39;s winding path. - Adapted from the Foreword by Rev. Peter Lai From the Preface: Those who do not know me that well know only that I graduated from Princeton and Harvard, and that I am the Chief of Cardiology and Assistant Physician-In-Chief of a medical center. Usually people are very surprised when I tell them I grew up in an orphanage.... As I reflect on my life, I can see many twists and turns. The most comforting thing is that God chose me to be His child even before I knew Him. When I lost my earthly father, He stepped in to fill the void and become my heavenly Father. At different stages of my life, He sent different people to help me out. When I fell, He lifted me up. When I strayed from Him, He gently guided me back to the right path.... I want to share my life story with others not because I am rich and famous, or that I have anything of which I can boast, but because I am convinced that God has a perfect plan for each of us. There is a reason He allows all the twists and turns, crossroads and tunnels in each of our lives." />
