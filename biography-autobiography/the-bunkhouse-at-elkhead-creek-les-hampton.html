    	<p> The Bunkhouse at Elkhead Creek is a reminiscence of life in the country. Now, most would surmise that life in an unpopulated area of Colorado, consisting of two residents per square mile, should be uncomplicated; however, when external issues impact ones life, cowboys react. The first rule of the cowboy is to protect that which belongs to the cowboy. So, when an action taken by a government agency thirty years prior threatens his home, the protective hormones surface. After about ten years of cussin and discussin, this threat is no more resolved when another government-induced threat is laid at his doorstep. This threat results in another two years of cussin and discussin before it is resolved. During this period of turmoil, it is suggested that the author take the retirement of a local county commissioner as an opportunity to run for public office. Unfortunately, he makes the wrong decision, and during his period in office, the country goes into a national economic slow down. This downturn eventually impacts the countys expenditures and services are reduced. These cuts are very unpopular with certain segments of the community. As Rudy Giuliani, the former Mayor of New York, once said, When you confront a problem, you begin to solve it. As the author works through all of these unexpected problems, like a mystery novel, he learns that everything is not as it seems. When he digs into these issues, he discovers many misrepresentations. Warren Buffet, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is quoted, Only when the tide goes out do you discover whos been swimming naked. Is it possible that Mayor Giuliani and Warren Buffet are cowboys? The serenity of life at the bunkhouse is a cherished but fragile giftinsert the first rule of the cowboy here.</p>
