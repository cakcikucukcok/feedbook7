  <title>Belize Journal - Barbara Gish Dickens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Suddenly left a widow at fifty-one, the author made a visit to her brother in U.S. Peace Corps in Belize, Central America.  She found life among the Maya Indians of the village just what she needed for healing her spirit and fashioning a new life.  She became involved in village life, first through the curiosity of the children who began borrowing her children&#39;s books.  Two years later she was accepted into Peace Corps and her library expanded with book donations from the U.S. to include youth and adults.  A permanent home was found in a village building and a local Mayan became librarian.
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Other avenues of service were found in music, youth groups, teaching at school and to individuals, and by 1989, at the end of four years of service, Barbara was an accepted part of village life.  She still visits and keeps in touch with friends there." />
