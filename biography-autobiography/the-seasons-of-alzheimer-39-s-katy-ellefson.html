  <title>The Seasons of Alzheimer&#39;s - Katy Ellefson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, we went to the Salvation Army warehouse to help wrap gifts for children in need. Mom and I enjoyed our afternoon. I put Moms hand in place to hold the paper, and I would hurry to get the tape on before she lost grip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mom repeatedly asked, Who are the presents for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I repeatedly said, They are for children and families in need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mom was happy all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way home, I decided to stop at the health food store. I only needed a couple of items, and there was a parking space close to the store. Mom said she was too tired to go in and wanted to wait in the car. I agreed, and it would be quicker for me to go in alone. She was buckled in her seatbelt and hadnt yet remembered how to unbuckle it. I was confident Mom would be fine. I locked her in the car and told her I would be back in five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grabbed the items I needed, peeked out the window, saw Mom in the car, and proceeded to the checkout. There was one customer ahead of me. Checkout went fast, and I rushed out to the car. Mom was gone! I panicked like never before. I wanted to scream. My mind raced. What should I do? Should I call the police? I cried, Where did Mom go?&lt;/p&gt;" />
