      <meta name="description" content="Who would have imagined child and human brokering was such a lucrative business?  And who would have conjured up an ingenious plan   that would cause your inventory to come to you?  Joan M. Sparks,Executive Director and behind the scenes child broker at the Good Samaritan Home.  A carnival worker, turned lion tamer turned preacher and activist . . . It was a long road getting there but when Joan arrived, she blew up in fan fair fashion.
Joan, herself orphaned and given up for adoption, decided she was going to create the family she never had no matter what it cost, or who paid.   While populating her home and lining her pockets, she came across Priscilla.  No one knew where Priscilla came from or who she belong to, but, Joan knew, and she had a plan for little Prissy. 
Preying on the emotions of a childless family, Joan turned Priscilla into to one of the most coveted products in her extensive portfolio of human stock.
Although several attempts were made to have Joan Sparks charged with fraud,kidnapping and child abuse, She died having never been charged with with any offense committed against Priscilla." />
