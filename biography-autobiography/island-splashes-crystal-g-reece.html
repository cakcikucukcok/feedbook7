  <title>Island Splashes - Crystal G. Reece</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is important is the circles of influence that have helped me to become who I am today. God has used each splash to divinely order every step to ripple through every part of my life, ministry, and story. I pray to continually make splashes with those impacts from here to the uttermost parts of the earth, by living out each lesson learned. Never forget that regardless of the size of the splash, each one of them continues to ripple across the ocean of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Crystal Reece, Author&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her story is our story. Its the life of contrasts the writer of Ecclesiastes told us about. Sadness and joy, tears and victory, grief and dancing, crawling and flying  its all there. But, unlike so many, the fragile segments of Crystals life are held together by the God-thread of unwavering trust. It is this very thread that reaches out and weaves you into the amazing tale of a life of selfless devotion to the God of the universe. More than a memoir, this is a story that can become yours if you let it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Melani Shock, Pentecostals of Alexandria, and author of Eat This Book&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you expect this book to be about a young womans call to do missions work, it is. Do you perceive it to be about prayer? You are correct. Do you view this as a how-to book on finding Gods will and experiencing His provision? Right again; its all this and more! This book illustrates how God strategically places influencers in our lives to splash us, as Crystal so ably states, causing ripple effects. As you read, may your heart be stirred, causing you to splash others with the all-encompassing love of Jesus Christ!&lt;/p&gt;
