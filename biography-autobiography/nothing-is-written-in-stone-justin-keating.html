  <title>Nothing is Written in Stone - Justin Keating</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
        ‘After I retired from legal practice, Justin and I were able to spend
        time in a family house in the Languedoc in France, and while we were
        there he would devote time to writing in his notebook… Once he began to
        write, the words seemed to flow for him. He left eight notebooks. The
        earliest is dated July 2006, the final one October 2009.’
    &lt;/em&gt;
    (Barbara Hussey)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Justin Keating, son of the artist Sean Keating, attended UCD and TCD. He
    was a Labour Party politician (Minister for Industry 1973-77), academic,
    journalist, veterinary surgeon, television pioneer (as Head of Agricultural
    Broadcasting at RTE) and award-winning documentary filmmaker. In later life
    he served as Member of the European Parliament and became president of the
    Humanist Association. President Michael D. Higgins called him ‘a man who
    saw socialism as both essential and adaptable to change’. Keating
    introduced the first substantial legislation for the development of
    Ireland&#39;s oil and gas, set up the National Film Studios of Ireland at
    Ardmore and gave impetus to Kilkenny Design. He wrote extensively – and
    with opinions well ahead of his time – on the natural world, including
    women’s health, animal welfare, sustainable energy and ecology.
    &lt;em&gt;
        ‘A well made, fit thoroughbred really striding out seems to me one of
        the most beautiful things on earth, on a par with an orchid or
        porpoise.’
    &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Edited posthumously by his wife, Barbara Hussey, Justin Keating’s notebooks
    offer an in-depth, often-impassioned account of the interests, musings and
    opinions of one of Ireland’s most wide-ranging intellectuals. His dealings
    with J.D Bernal, No&lt;em&gt;ë&lt;/em&gt;l Browne, Sean McBride, Charles Haughey, Gerry
    Fitt and Conor Cruise-O’Brien, form part of this absorbing chronicle, aside
from myriad friendships with writers and artists.    &lt;em&gt;Nothing Is Written in Stone&lt;/em&gt; is a brilliant self-portrait of this
    multi-dimensional man, who did so much to shape twenty-first century
    Ireland.
