  <title>Time to Let It Go - Chloe Jays</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My book is based on a true story. I was motivated to write this book to help the reader understand that determination is your success. The obstacles we experience in our life cannot stop us get what we want to gain in life. The girl called Chloe lived through hell on earth, but that did not make her give up in life. She had a very high faith and the worse things seemed to be at her surrounding the more she was motivated to build her life and never to live in such situation or poverty again. Chloes determination is to see that her children will never live the life she lived. Chloe stay focused at the time. She never even ran away from those who were hostile to her. Her life is a great testimony for those who saw her growing up, including her grandmother and all the villagers and her family. She completely transformed her life. She had such a high spirit that she knew no lion can frighten her. She believed she will give a giant fight, for she knew it was her right to have happiness at last. This book can help a reader to have some courage to face life under whatever the circumstances. My point of writing my book is that it came to my understanding that many people blame themselves because of wicked people who try to make their selves happy by doing evil and abusing others. There are people who are losers in life, and they want everyone to be where they are. This book is to help you as a reader know that these kinds of bad guys can never be satisfied whether they are rich or poor. Never give up. Chloe did not give up. She was so much of an example to the school where she went, including her fellow students who bullied her in school because of her poverty. Poverty is unjust; it falls to any man at any time." />
