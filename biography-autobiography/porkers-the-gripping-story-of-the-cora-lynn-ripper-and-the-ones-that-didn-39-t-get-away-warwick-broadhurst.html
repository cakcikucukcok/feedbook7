      <meta name="description" content="THERE ARE DAYS when a pig hunt can resemble a clash between Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote:  &quot;I suddenly realized that I wasn&#39;t alone! ... it had gone black, and an animal raced up the tunnel towards me ...&quot;  &quot;I jumped up and put my feet into gear before my brain, charging off through the scrub with my head down and with my eyes half shut.

One dog had an ear while lying on his back on the ground with his four feet in the air, and the others lay around panting. It was a very hot day.
