  <title>Another Side of Bob Dylan - Victor Maymudes, Jacob Maymudes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A vivid, first-hand account of Nobel Prize-winning singer and songwriter Bob Dylan as an artist, friend, and celebrity, illustrated with never-before-seen photographs, and told by an engaging raconteur who cut his own swathe through the turbulent counterculture.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;August 2014 marks 50 years since Bob Dylan released his fourth album, Another Side of Bob Dylan. Recorded in one night, in the middle of a turbulent year in his life, the music marked a departure from Dylan&#39;s socially-conscious folk songs and began his evolution toward other directions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the years they spent together, few people outside of Dylan&#39;s immediate family were closer than Victor Maymudes, who was Dylan&#39;s tour manager, personal friend, and travelling companion from the early days in 1960s Greenwich Village through the late 90&#39;s. Another Side of Bob Dylan recounts landmark events including Dylan&#39;s infamous motorcycle crash; meeting the Beatles on their first US tour; his marriage to Sara Lownds, his romances with Suze Rotolo, Joan Baez, and others; fellow travelers Ramblin&#39; Jack Elliott, Wavy Gravy, Dennis Hopper, The Band, The Traveling Wilburys, and more; memorable concerts, and insights on Dylan&#39;s songwriting process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On January 26th, 2001, after recording more than 24 hours of taped memories in preparation for writing this book, Victor Maymudes suffered an aneurysm and died. His son Jacob has written the book, using the tapes to shape the story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A L&lt;i&gt;os Angeles Times &lt;/i&gt;Best Seller.&lt;/p&gt;" />
