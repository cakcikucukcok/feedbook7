  <title>Child of Stone - Casey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Why do I hurt so much and why does it feel like I can&#39;t stop crying.  I feel so alone in this world like I&#39;m living in some sort of hell on earth and no one can save me.  I go to bed but I cannot sleep.   I simply think about everything.  Why am I here, what is my purpose and why do I feel that I must protect everyone at the cost of myself.  I need to feel valued and loved to be hugged and told that I&#39;m special. I need a mother who wants a daughter and why do I have to have her!  Please God rescue me from her torture and hatred&quot;.  
     These are the painful words of a 10 year old child who is being physically and sexually abused.  This book is intended to show the reader what abuse is truly like.  Some of the scenes are graphic in nature, but that is because they are real.  If you want to understand what a child goes through when they are being abused, to truly open your eyes to their pain, then this book is for you.  It is also intended to help others who have been or are being abused to stop feeling alone and to know that there is a way out." />
