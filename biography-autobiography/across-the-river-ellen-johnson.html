      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Across the River&lt;/i&gt; presents the lovingly detailed memoir of author Ellen Johnsons mother, Ann Reynalds. Johnson chronicles the trials and tribulations that her mother had to face as the child of a biracial union. Ultimately, Reynalds had to flee her country of birth, Grenada, in shame and start a humble life all over again, in another country. She credits her strong belief in God for giving her the strength, courage, and will to continue on her journey.  
As the mother of five children, Reynalds experienced great happiness and sorrow. When her oldest son, Lenny, was eleven, he died in her arms. Later, she would revisit the country of her birth to reconnect with her second child. Through it all, her belief in God carries her through the happy times and sad times of her life, from a daughter who suddenly takes ill to the joys of motherhood the face of poverty. In this loving tribute, a daughter paints a heartfelt and honest portrait of her mother and a life well-lived." />
