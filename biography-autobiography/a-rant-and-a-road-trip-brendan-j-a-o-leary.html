  <title>A Rant and a Road Trip - Brendan J. A. O’Leary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;A Rant and a Road Trip&#39; chronicles an alternative holiday, you might say, a heart-on-the-sleeve road trip. Its not so much about where Brendan OLeary went, but what he found when he got there and the people he met along the way. This journal covers five weeks spent on the road, drifting from town to town and motel to motel, living out of a suitcase and, for the most part, never knowing where the next stop will be. 
But believe it when OLeary tells you that it can be a very liberating experience, seeing another town, another diner, another motel, the story continuing as he travels to new places. Nothing can beat the feeling that comes from unexpected discoveries made while traveling. 
As you travel through the pages of this journal, youll see what OLeary sees and feel what he feels. From New Jersey to Texas to California, OLeary shares his thoughts about the places he visits and the people he meets. Written as very personal journal entries, OLeary examines the essence of America through his experiences and shares the ups and downs of living life on the road." />
