  <title>Autobiography of a Naturalist and Environmentalist - R. B. Eltringham, S. K. Eltringham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is an autobiography based on Keiths memoirs which
he wrote shortly before he died in 2006 not for publication but for his
descendents who might be interested in how he spent his life. He didnt
think there would be wide interest but this was far from true and in fact
he wrote a most interesting story of his life especially in Africa where he
lived with his family for several years
Keith was born in 1929 in rural Canada on the prairies of Alberta.
He was always passionate about animals and wanted nothing else than a
life involving animals and this was something that he achieved. He went
to school in Bristol and was educated at Southampton University and
Cambridge where he taught for several years. He had a wide knowledge
of the animal world and was very knowledgeable about every animal that
he met. He acquired an encyclopedic knowledge of the animal world and
he wanted nothing more than to learn all he could about animals and to
this end as a youngster he established a so called zoo in the garden. Our
mother was not too happy when he introduced ants to what he called Ant
Island which was an upturned dust bin lid" />
