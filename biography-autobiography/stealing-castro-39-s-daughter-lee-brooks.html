  <title>Stealing Castro&#39;s Daughter - Lee Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many fall for Cuba&#39;s music, its dance, the enduring strength and charm of its people. Award-winning actor Lee Brooks fell for one of its women. But how to pluck this forbidden fruit away from the so-called island frozen in time, where even romance can be illegal? Out-foxing the Castro regime&#39;s state military apparatus, only to be forced into a shady web of human smugglers and a months-long limbo at sea, Brooks and his Cuban princess show that not only does love conquer all, but that when it comes to Cuba, fact is often much wilder than any kind of fiction. &lt;i&gt;Stealing Castro&#39;s Daughter&lt;/i&gt; is a tour de force of adventure romance set against the lush tapestry of Caribbean&#39;s crown jewel, at one of the most important junctures of the island&#39;s rich history. Surrounded by poverty, struggle and sacrifice, this is the real Cuba, and two people&#39;s real determination to overcome the odds and escape into love&#39;s lasting embrace. With its gritty hairpin turns, heartfelt honesty and sensual prose, Brooks captures the aching beauty of Cuba, and a desire that defies all obstacles. Read and be awed.&lt;br&gt;
