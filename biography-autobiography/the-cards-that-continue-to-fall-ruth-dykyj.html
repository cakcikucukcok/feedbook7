  <title>The Cards That Continue to Fall - Ruth Dykyj</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We learn that in life, things nearly always never go to plan. This was mostly the case for Hanna, a young woman whose father is a transgender, and her life always seemed to be something different to what it actually was. Through this journey of Hanna&#39;s life, she tells the story of how one of the most important things is to stay true to what you believe.
Hanna was always born to roam, and that&#39;s exactly what she would do. From helping young children in Africa to working alongside orangutans and sun bears in Borneo to just visiting friends around the world, she would always be a traveler.
Hanna has a great passion to make a difference in the life of all living beings! For all the misfortune that Hanna may have faced with the cards she had been dealt, she was just as equally blessed. Hanna finds truth, understanding, and contentment in her life through great friends and family and a passion for compassion!" />
