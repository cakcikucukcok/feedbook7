  <title>My Bipolar Memoir of Poetry and Hope - Susan Walz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My memoir shares my story of what it&#39;s like to live, survive and eventually thrive with Bipolar 1 Disorder. Through my unique and creative approach of using poetry and prose, I take the reader with me on my journey full of pain, sorrows, losses, suicide attempts, homelessness, the ups and downs of bipolar and how I learned to cope, reached recovery and became a bipolar survivor. My journey shows my strength and perseverance to overcome many obstacles and struggles and is full of hope, love, inspiration and my faith in God. My collection of poetry and prose express my pain, sorrow, courage, resiliency, inspiration and hope, all at the same time. Honestly and openly, I share my deep and most inner thoughts in a manner that lets the reader enter inside my mind showing what it&#39;s like to live with bipolar, which can be very sad, lonely and painful, but can also be a very positive life full of hope, love and the joy of living and survival. I hope my book will inspire and give hope to everyone that reads it." />
