  <title>We Were in the First Waves of Steel Amtracs Who Landed on Iwo Jima - John Ryland Thurman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is based on my personal experiences. I have
always felt that what I did was just my job and what was required
of me to do as a Marine following orders. It became apparent to
me when I visited the island of Okinawa for a month in 1997. I was
honored by Marines, young and old, who were stationed there at
the time. They wanted to hear of my experiences, to meet me and
shake my hand. I started writing this book late in my life and I am
not a professional writer. For a long time after Iwo Jima, I found it
hard to talk about my experiences. I was able to do some talks at
private clubs and at the Marine Corps Training Center in Okinawa
and from these talks; I was encouraged to write this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really made me decide to try and write was after my
talk at the Marine Crops Training Center in Okinawa. There was a
group of Marines waiting for me and one of the Marines stepped
up and asked, Sir, we would like to ask you some questions. I
said sure. He then asked Is our training anywhere near the real
thing? That caught me for a second. I said yes, your body had
been conditioned to be strong and is ready to handle any kind of
unknown rough terrain and still have the strength to take out any
enemy gun position; youre going to need it. But the mind could
never be fully ready. It cant be. It has to happen fi rst. Youve been
told what to expect, but it is diff erent when you see it for real right
in front of your own eyes. You have to swallow hard and just keep
going. Youre training has given you a healthy mind and this will
get you through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That question made me realize these young men need to be
told what its like out there. I owe it to the men and the Corps.
I have come to realize that these personal experiences are
also a very important time and a piece of history that will go with
me if I fail to share them here. Memories and sights that only a
few have experienced and all should have the opportunity to learn
about if they so choose. This book is not intended to be abrasive,
insultive, discriminatory, or grotesque in nature as is more to capture
and recollect the vivid memoirs of a Marine who fought on
the front lines in the battle of Iwo Jima. To defend the freedoms
and this great Country for which I have never taken for granted.&lt;/p&gt;" />
