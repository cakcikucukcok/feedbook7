  <title>We&#39;re Just Like You, Only Prettier - Celia Rivenbark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;On the short drive to the preschool,&lt;br&gt;I dutifully unwrap a NutriGrain bar and&lt;br&gt;toss it into the back seat to my four-year-old.&lt;br&gt;Sometimes I&#39;ll even unwrap one for myself.&lt;br&gt;Studies have shown that it&#39;s very important&lt;br&gt;for familes to eat together. . . . &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why couldn&#39;t the Sopranos survive living down South?

When Daddy takes the kids out in public dressed in pajama tops and Tweety Bird swim socks. Again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the Southern woman&#39;s opinion of a new &quot;fat virus&quot; theory?
