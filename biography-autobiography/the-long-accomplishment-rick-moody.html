As Moody has put it, &quot;this is a story in which a lot of bad luck is the daily fare of the protagonists, but in which they are also in love.&quot; To Moody&#39;s astonishment, matrimony turns out to be the site of strength in hard times, a vessel infinitely tougher and more durable than any boat these two participants would have traveled by alone. Love buoys the couple, lifting them above their hardships, and the reader is buoyed along with them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
