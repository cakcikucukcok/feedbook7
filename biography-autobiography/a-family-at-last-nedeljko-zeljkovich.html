  <title>A Family at Last - Nedeljko Zeljkovich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a true story about the life of Nedeljko Zeljkovic.  The journey starts when his mother gives away her five year old son to an orphanage so she could pursue her career.
At the age of fifteen years, at the beginning of World War II, he had to survive on his own, living in the streets, dodging bullets and bombs. When he was finally old enough, he joined the British service, met Anneliese, married and moved to the United States.
This memoir delivers a portrayal of the hardships he endured during his childhood and early adult years. However, he never lost his faith, compassion or courage. It is a compelling book which will humble, uplift and inspire its readers." />
