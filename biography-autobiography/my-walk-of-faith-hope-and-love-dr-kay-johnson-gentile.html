  <title>My Walk of Faith, Hope, and Love - Dr. Kay Johnson-Gentile</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an inspiring story of one womans personal transformation from breast cancer, and how the music of John Denver served as a springboard to help extricate her from severe depression brought on by the disease and its radical treatment. 
Kay Johnson would later connect with John, talking with him on the phone and eventually meeting him in person. After recovering, Kay was asked to begin a Volunteer Music Therapy Program for Children and Adolescents with Cancer at Roswell Park Cancer Institute. This was a pilot project sponsored by the New York State Division of the American Cancer Society. 
John asked to be kept in the loop regarding the program. When he performed in Buffalo again, he donated free concert tickets for all the children in the music program, a real Rocky Mountain High for these kids! 
Kay traveled for the ACS, telling her personal cancer story and sharing how music helped in her recovery. She would use powerful music  some of it original  in her presentations. Kay would go on to be selected as One of Ten Outstanding Young Women of America in 1977 for this work. 
The book demonstrates the power of music as a therapeutic tool for rehabilitation from illness and how lifes darkest, most challenging moments can be times of positive transformation." />
