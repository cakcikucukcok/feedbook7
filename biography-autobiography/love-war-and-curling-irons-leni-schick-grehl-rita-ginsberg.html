Yearning for a fresh start in life, Leni ventures to find her esteemed grandparents in Bremen-Aumund, Germany, only to discover that an American sergeant has befriended her grandparents. Spellbound by their first encounter, the story ignites as two lives are changed by the circumstances of war that brought them together.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A heartfelt tale touched with humor and eloquent simplicity, &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Love, War &amp; Curling Irons&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; both inspires and delights readers as it chronicles a life where the will and love stand strong despite overwhelming obstacles.
