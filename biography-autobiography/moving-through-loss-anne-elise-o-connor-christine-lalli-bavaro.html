  <title>Moving Through Loss - Anne Elise O’Connor, Christine Lalli Bavaro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The dreaded day has come and gone  he has died and Im still here. I could not imagine a tomorrow without him. &lt;p&gt;
Words and feelings echoed from the depth of pain so profound that recovery seemed impossible. How do we pick up the pieces of our lives and move on?  If we allow it, grief takes us on a journey of self-discovery which teaches us how to laugh again.  &lt;p&gt;
A licensed mental health counselor and licensed certified social worker, Chris Bavaro has counseled many clients grieving the death of their loved ones. Yet it wasnt until Bavaro became a widow that she truly understood the depth of that grief. When support from friends and family wasnt enough to ease her pain, she used the complementary therapies of flower essences and inner journeys to help her heal - therapies that could be beneficial to others struggling with grief. &lt;p&gt;
Moving Through Loss is filled with vivid descriptions of inner journeys, self-help suggestions and is a primer on flower essences. It is a courageous story of love and hope told with pathos and gentle humor as seen through the eyes of a psychotherapist and the heart of a widow.&lt;p&gt;" />
