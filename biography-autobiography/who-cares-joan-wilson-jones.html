  <title>Who Cares - Joan Wilson-Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When author Joan Wilson-Jones partner Philip was diagnosed with an aggressive metastasized prostate cancer in 2002, she quickly found that despite her personal resources and professional training, she was not ready for her new role as a caregiver. She realized it would potentially stretch her to her limits. And, she was right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Who Cares&lt;/i&gt;, Wilson-Jones presents a support guide for other caregivers. Included in this heartfelt memoir are ideas and suggestions for caregiver care to help friends and family understand ways in which they can help. She shares how this is an important component of supporting people with life-changing and life-threatening illness, particularly when many choose to stay at home and out of hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geared toward every caregiver, anyone who is supporting a caregiver, and anyone who has ever wished they could do something to help, &lt;i&gt;Who Cares&lt;/i&gt; offers compassionate insight into the realities of being in a caring role. Wilson-Jones describes the highs and lows, shows caregivers how to navigate the obstacles and challenges, and offers supportive strategies and proven ideas. &lt;/p&gt;" />
