  <title>In Pursuit of Right and Justice - William E Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;In Pursuit of Right and Justice&lt;/B&gt; chronicles the life of the United States District Court&#39;s Judge Edward Weinfeld, from his humble Lower East Side origins to his distinction as one of the nation&#39;s most respected federal judges. Judge Edward Weinfeld&#39;s personal growth and socio-economic mobility provides an excellent illustration of how Catholics and Jews descended from turn-of-the-century immigrants were assimilated into the mainstream of New York and American life during the course of the twentieth century. Weinfeld left a rich collection of personal papers that William E. Nelson examines, which depict the compromises and sacrifices Weinfeld had to make to attain professional advancement. Weinfeld&#39;s jurisprudence remained closely tied to his own personal values and to the historical contexts in which cases came to his court.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nelson aptly describes how Weinfeld strove to avoid making new law. He tried to make decisions on preexisting rules or bedrock legal principles; he achieved just results by searching for and finding facts that called those rules into play. Weinfeld&#39;s vision of justice was simultaneously a liberal one that enabled him to develop law that reflected societal change, and an apolitical one that did not rest on contested policy judgments.&lt;/p&gt;" />
