  <title>Feckless  Judges - Oliver Kaye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever been so incensed by injustice and prejudice that you just had to do something about it?  I wish I had been warned of the futility of fighting to see my son in the English Family courts and the incredible emotional and financial toll I would face.
This book explains what happened to me and how I found the system worked in reality. I never realised how the fecklessness of so many of the professionals involved rendered the system so biased. I have included some passages from my diary as background. As well as criticism I offer ideas to improve the system. For those fathers facing a similarly determined obstructive mother I hope this account will be helpful." />
