  <title>Feeling Deported? - Peter F. K. R. Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Living in America does not mean you are an American citizen.
This is what you need to know. Make no mistake about it. If you have been born one moment away or one foot from the borders of this country, you must consider yourself a guest within the borders. So act accordingly and behave yourself! Or you will find yourself on the receiving end of a very tragic and unsympathetic deportation process.
This book is crazy as hell. Its like having four books in one. Its a sequel to Do You Want To Go To Jail Today? and A Wrong Turn . . . A Bad Decision: The Extortion of Probation by Nick Rahaman. In this book the day-to-day struggles to survive within the walls of a deportation camp and racism is redefined.
Many of us believe what is happening with deportation is appalling, cruel, and vicious. Many of us has certainly justified it is necessary for the safety of our citizens, property, livelihood, and the economic stability of our nation." />
