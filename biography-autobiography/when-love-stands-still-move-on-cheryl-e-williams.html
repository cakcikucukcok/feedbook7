  <title>When Love Stands Still, Move On! - Cheryl E. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Love Stands Still, Move On!, is the story of all women living in relationships with men, the same men, for years, with no ring or marriage in sight. If you asked them why, they would probably not have an answer; they could not begin to explain, except to say, because I love him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When we fall in love, when we become comfortable with someone, and when we give our hearts completely to that person, we find ourselves doing so many things that we just cant explain; things that we will probably one day regret.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Very few women can honestly say that the ring and the marriage are not important to them after being in a long term relationship. Its what we tell ourselves to get through the reality that, after years, the man that weve loved for so long has never asked us to marry and maybe never will.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When a woman commits herself to loving a man for a long period of time; for years, and he does not ask her to marry him its as if he is saying to her, the woman whose life he has coveted, whose body he has made use of, and whose love he has accepted for years, that she is not worthy of marriage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For those women who are living in a life long courtship, you are not alone. This is the story of Gabriela Tymes. Like so many other women, Gabriela has been in a relationship with the same man for years, with no ring, no marriage and no asking in sight. His name is Donovan." />
