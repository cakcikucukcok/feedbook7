Kennedy&amp;rsquo;s life, and also Adolf Hitler&amp;rsquo;s special guest at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. She was an actress, a foreign correspondent, a popular Washington columnist, an explorer who lived among a tribe of headhunters, one of Hollywood&amp;rsquo;s most influential gossip columnists, and a suspected Nazi spy.

She also had affairs with noted surgeon Dr. William Cahan, the prolific writer John Gunther, and Winston&amp;rsquo;s Churchill&amp;rsquo;s right hand man, Baron Robert Boothby. She was pursued by Wall Street financier Bernard Baruch, and Swedish industrialist Axel Wenner-Gren, reputedly the richest man in the world at the time, offered her $1 million to have his child.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Inga was Miss Denmark of 1931, but by all accounts her admirers among the European and American elite loved Inga not for her physical beauty alone, but for her &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;joie de vivre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. She was a genius with people, she was daring and adventurous, and she was their equal in intellect.
