  <title>My Tiny Love Teacher: A 19 Years and 11 Months Continuous Class - Monique Paul, D.J. Swykert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My Tiny Love Teacher is a novel based on real life events. Arianna was out of the city when she is informed her beloved kitty Choux is dying just a few days before her twentieth birthday.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To Arianna, Choux is not only a pet, Choux is part of her family and also her friend. Arianna takes the first available flight back home to be with darling Choux in her last minutes of life. While traveling Arianna remembers and tells us all these experiences, laughter and tears she and her son have shared with Choux and Sheila, her son Alex&amp;#39;s Doberman.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Coming from a dysfunctional family where she suffered psychological abuse and mistreatment for years, Arianna desperately searches for the way to give her son a happy and harmonious life full of love. With Choux Arianna learned to experience the unconditional love, compassion, and forgiveness that would help her give her son the life she wants and her professional success.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Choux came to Arianna&amp;rsquo;s life just at the right time, when she was ready to learn, to apply her wisdom and to make significant changes in her life. Little Choux was herself a miracle of life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For nearly twenty years, Arianna learned from Choux. She learned to live in the present; she learned that she could materialize all her desires with the complicity of the universe, and she learned that the true source of abundance is within.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Being blessed with a loving son and pets, Arianna applied the wisdom she learned from her darling Choux day by day achieving the harmonious life she longed to have. This harmony allowed her to raise her son in the healthy environment full of love, happiness and understanding raising him to be a happy father and successful man.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My Tiny Love Teacher will make you cry and laugh, will make you reject abuse; and will get you look at your pet in a whole different way. Who knows, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a pet, then you might want to go to a shelter to adopt a Tiny Love Teacher that won&amp;rsquo;t do anything but give you love and gratefulness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Choux was real, and she is now a little guardian angel and a &amp;ldquo;Tiny Love Teacher&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tell me&amp;hellip; Do you have a Tiny Love Teacher in your home?&lt;/p&gt;" />
