  <title>The Nepalese Legacy in Short Stories - Danny Teller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Danny Teller is a UK national, and he was born in 1964. For most of his intrepid and industrious childhood, he lived in the UK before immigrating to Israel in the mid-1980s. In 2002 or nearly twenty years later, he left Israel and moved to America for a short and relaxing time.  He subsequently moved from America to spend nearly six months teaching English in a small but very remote village in the southern part of Nepal between 2002 and 2003. 
By the spring of 2003, Danny decided to return to the UK, where he spent the next few years working in a new career for two large retail companies in Central London. In some of his free time, he projected considerable amounts of efforts in creative writing, online blogs, publishing and improving his overall knowledge of IT. During this time, he also made numerous but mainly pleasurable trips to the African, Asian, American, and European Continents respectively. 
Moreover, in recent times, such as in 2009, Danny has made another affluent move to the Peoples Democratic Republic of China. He is currently residing with his long-term companion Yvonne Wu, who, ever since the summer of 2014, became his Chinese wife. Danny is also the author of two other e-books, one of which was coauthored by Yvonne. 
The Eternity of Being a Global Explorer is only available as an e-book which was published in 2013; Full of Jewish Promise and Spiritual adventures, which was available in e-book format as well as in hard copy, was published in later part of 2015 or the early part of 2016." />
