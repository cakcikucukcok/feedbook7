  <title>A Determined Man - Arthur O. Aloisio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the moment he was born his mother witnessed a severe accident that almost claimed his life but was luckily saved.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He grew up as a shy child of immigrant parents after the depression. Eventually the author was able to break out of his timidness and succeed in two careers. The story shows how his personality exploded in his middle twenties to eventually become a confident individual in large groups.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his early childhood his family was unaware of a certain hardship that existed. Being the youngest child of the family, he always thought that he had to prove to others that he would succeed. The author points out that in life you can set goals for yourself and sometimes exceed them.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In elementary school he was not considered the top student in his class, but never feared that he could one day reach that level.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a parent he was aware of his duties as the leader of the family, to seek out opportunities to better himself monetarily and change careers for it.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be able to see how this author approached life with a competitive spirit that allowed him to adapt with the conditions that existed at the time, and succeed.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some families today may have children who have the same issues that the author had, and apply the same principles that this author described in his story.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its an extraordinary story about someones life who reached success by true grit.&lt;/P&gt;" />
