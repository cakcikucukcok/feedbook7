  <title>The Old Lady of Vine Street - Richard K. Mastain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE OLD LADY OF VINE STREET REVEALED&lt;p&gt;
These days the notion of a free press is almost an entirely foreign concept, and its ever-diminishing presence in our society has shown itself to be a thief of true democracy.&lt;p&gt;
The Old Lady of Vine Street is the story of a small band of reporters who had the courage to risk everything they had for their belief in the importance of a free and independent press. They had the audacity to fight the powerful Taft family for the right to buy their own newspaper, the Cincinnati Enquirer.&lt;p&gt;
The story unfolds in January 1952 in Cincinnati and moves on to the Federal District Court in Washington, D.C. Reporters Jim Ratliff and Jack Cronin head the list of major players that also includes the former United States Senator who chaired the Senate investigation of Joseph McCarthy in 1950, two of the wealthiest men in the United States, the most famous family in America, the trust company that sold the Washington Post to Eugene Meyers for $833,000, and over 800 Cincinnati Enquirer employees who risked their homes and lifes savings for a chance to own their paper, affectionately known as the Old Lady of Vine Street." />
