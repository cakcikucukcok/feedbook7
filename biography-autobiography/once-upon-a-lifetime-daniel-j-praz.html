  <title>Once Upon a Lifetime - Daniel J. Praz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One chance encounter can change lives forever!  An up and coming rock star becomes obsessed with the potential girl of his dreams after an ever so brief encounter one night in a downtown music club.  Completely obsessed with the womans vision, the smitten guitarist devises a unique formula to capture the love of this young woman, even though he knows nothing about hernot even her name!  He writes and sends to her romantic elaborate poems that show his love of her, and signs his name Rumpelstiltskin, from the Brothers Grimm fairly tale, whose muse was youll never know my name.  
Set against a backdrop of sex, drugs and rock and roll of the music scene of that time, and with a cast of characters who prove that truth is stranger than fiction, this completely true modern fairly tale is the story of real love and romance that will change both of their lives forever!   From the time he first saw her, to the time he took and held her hand, to the time he kissed those hands, to the time he kissed her lips, to the time he first touched her body, to the time he could have died in her arms, to the time he knew she was his one true soul mate, he knew this was not the ordinary.  This was not the typical.  This was once in a lifetime, his once in a lifetime." />
