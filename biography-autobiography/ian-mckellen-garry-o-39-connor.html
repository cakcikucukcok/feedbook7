  <title>Ian McKellen - Garry O&#39;Connor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The definitive biography of Sir Ian McKellen from an acclaimed biographer  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2001, Ian McKellen put on the robe and pointed hat of a wizard named Gandalf and won a place in the hearts of Tolkien fans worldwide.  Though his role in the film adaptation of Lord of the Rings introduced him to a new audience, McKellen had a thriving career a lifetime before his visit to Middle Earth. He made his West End acting debut in 1964 in James Saunders&#39;s &lt;i&gt;A Scent of Flowers&lt;/i&gt;, but it was in 1980 that he took Broadway by storm when he played Antonio Salieri in Peter Shaffer&#39;s Tony-Award-winning play &lt;i&gt;Amadeus&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He has starred in over four hundred plays and films and he is that rare character: a celebrity whose distinguished political and social service has transcended his international fame to reach beyond the stage and screen. The breadth of his career--professional, personal and political--has been truly staggering: Macbeth (opposite Judi Dench), Iago, King Lear, Chekhov&#39;s Sorin in &lt;i&gt;The Seagull&lt;/i&gt; and Becket&#39;s tramp Estragon (opposite Patrick Stewart) in &lt;i&gt;Waiting for Godot&lt;/i&gt;. Add to all this his tireless political activism in the cause of gay equality and you have a veritable phenomenon. Garry O&#39;Connor&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Ian McKellen: A Biography&lt;/i&gt; probes the heart of the actor, recreating his greatest stage roles and exploring his personal life. &lt;i&gt;Ian McKellen&lt;/i&gt; will show readers what makes a great actor tick. His life story has been a constantly developing drama and this biography is the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;" />
