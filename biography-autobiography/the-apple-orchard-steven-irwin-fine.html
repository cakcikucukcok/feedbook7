  <title>The Apple Orchard - Steven Irwin Fine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A true story, leaving his family in South Africa in 1972, Shimon travels to Israel. He plans to learn the language, sleep with as many gorgeous girls as possible, join the army, and live for the day. But a chance encounter with a beguiling woman on the bus impacts his future far more than he could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shimon understands that at this time in history, as long as there are terrorists, Israel will never sleep in peace; it is a nation always fighting for survival. Fit and fast, he earns high praise from his superiors in the army; his personality and skills make him a perfect candidate for becoming an agent with the Shin Bet Israels Security Agency, a position where life and death situations are routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telling a tale of action, adventure, deception, and romance, &lt;i&gt;The Apple Orchard&lt;/i&gt; follows Shimon as he works covertly with Shin Bet to protect the religious freedoms in the Holy Land of Israel. The enemy fears Shimon and women love him, but his love for his country is the greatest love affair of them all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
