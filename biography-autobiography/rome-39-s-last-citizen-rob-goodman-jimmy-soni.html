  <title>Rome&#39;s Last Citizen - Rob Goodman, Jimmy Soni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;Cato, history&#39;s most famous foe of authoritarian power&lt;/b&gt;, was the pivotal political man of Rome; an inspiration to our Founding Fathers; and a cautionary figure for our times. He loved Roman republicanism, but saw himself as too principled for the mere politics that might have saved it. His life and lessons are urgently relevant in the harshly divided America--and world--of today. With erudition and verve, Rob Goodman and Jimmy Soni turn their life of Cato into the most modern of biographies, &lt;b&gt;a blend of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and Game Change&lt;/b&gt;.&quot;--Howard Fineman, Editorial Director of The Huffington Post Media Group, NBC and MSNBC News Analyst, and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Thirteen American Arguments&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;A truly outstanding piece of work.&lt;/b&gt; What most impresses me is the book&#39;s ability to reach through the confusing dynastic politics of the late Roman Republic to present social realities in a way intelligible to the modern reader. &lt;i&gt;Rome&#39;s Last Citizen&lt;/i&gt; entertainingly restores to life the stoic Roman who inspired George Washington, Patrick Henry and Nathan Hale. This is more than a biography: it is a study of how a reputation lasted through the centuries from the end of one republic to the start of another.&quot;--David Frum, &lt;i&gt;DailyBeast&lt;/i&gt; columnist, former White House speech writer, and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Right Man&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Marcus Porcius Cato: aristocrat who walked barefoot and slept on the ground with his troops, political heavyweight who cultivated the image of a Stoic philosopher, a hardnosed defender of tradition who presented himself as a man out of the sacred Roman past--and the last man standing when Rome&#39;s Republic fell to tyranny. His blood feud with Caesar began in the chamber of the Senate, played out on the battlefields of a world war, and ended when he took his own life rather than live under a dictator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centuries of thinkers, writers, and artists have drawn inspiration from Cato&#39;s Stoic courage. Saint Augustine and the early Christians were moved and challenged by his example. Dante, in his &lt;i&gt;Divine Comedy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; chose Cato to preside over the souls who arrive in Purgatory. George Washington so revered him that he staged a play on Cato&#39;s life to revive the spirit of his troops at Valley Forge. Now, in &lt;i&gt;Rome&#39;s Last Citizen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; Rob Goodman and Jimmy Soni deliver the first modern biography of this stirring figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cato&#39;s life is a gripping tale that resonates deeply with our own turbulent times. He grappled with terrorists, a debt crisis, endemic political corruption, and a huge gulf between the elites and those they governed. In many ways, Cato was the ultimate man of principle--he even chose suicide rather than be used by Caesar as a political pawn. But Cato was also a political failure: his stubbornness sealed his and Rome&#39;s defeat, and his lonely end casts a shadow on the recurring hope that a singular leader can transcend the dirty business of politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rome&#39;s Last Citizen&lt;/i&gt; is a timeless story of an uncompromising man in a time of crisis and his lifelong battle to save the Republic.&lt;/p&gt;" />
