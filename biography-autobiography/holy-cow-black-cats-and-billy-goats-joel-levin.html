  <title>Holy Cow, Black Cats and Billy Goats - Joel Levin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work was sparked by the Chicago Cubss 2016 world championship win. Joel M. Levin felt instant joy of victory after waiting seventy-one years to see it happen. This was quickly followed by a stirring of memories and emotions going back to 1945 when he saw his first ball game. He calls the memories, the treasures of his mind, and shares them with the reader. They include impressions of the world at large; details of his inner life; and the fortunes, fables, and foibles of his favorite baseball team. The story starts with a young boy whose family experiences early America with both depression and an oncoming war, but he is able to start on a lifetime journey as a loyal Chicago Cubs fan. In truth, the book is not a memoir, as few people are interested in the life of an ordinary man. It is more an examination of life as time moved on and how the author experienced it. It is not a pure or objective sports book nor is it analytical, critical, or historical. Once again, it is from the vantage point of a fan. It is called a trilogy, a combined tale of the world at large, the impact on the author, and the destiny of the Chicago Cubs on the long, winding path to becoming the best team in baseball. 
The work includes references to music of the time and is peppered with poetic expressions; humor; and a creative look at curses, superstitions, and symbolization. The story begins with a young fan who sits in the bleachers and, in time, graduates to a premier seat near the Cubss dugout. Every Cubs fan in Joel Levins age group has a unique story to tell. The best part is they reached the finish line together, seeing their lovable losers as the last team standing. 
There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle (Albert Einstein)." />
