  <title>Planet of the Umps - Ken Kaiser, David Fisher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Two things nobody wants to grow up to be are an umpire and broke. Thanks to my career in baseball, I got both.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After calling balls, strikes, and outs for thirty-six baseball seasons and more than three thousand major-league games, umpire Ken Kaiser finally called it a career. From the first day he hit a minor-league catcher with a pool table to the fateful day baseball called him out on a strike, Kaiser was one of the game&#39;s most popular and colorful characters. And in this autobiography--written with the coauthor of Ron Luciano&#39;s classic bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Umpire Strikes Back&lt;/i&gt;--Kaiser brings to life his wild adventures from the pro-wrestling arena to the baseball diamond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the hysterically true story of four decades of baseball as lived and loved on the playing field, from Ted Williams and Billy Martin to Derek Jeter and Mark McGwire, from one-eyed umpires to space-age technology. As he did throughout his long and sometimes controversial career, the larger-than-his-chest-protector Kaiser calls &#39;em as he saw &#39;em.&lt;/p&gt;" />
