  <title>Serve with Heart and Might - Oluneye Oluwole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the words of William Wordsworth, There is one great society alone on earth: the noble living and the noble dead. Either way, none can be forgotten, as this is what Serve with Heart and Might is all about. 
Serve with Heart and Might is an inspirational personal account of Oluneye Oluwoles journey through the political landscape in Nigeria. From the beginning, she leaves you in no delusion, and you can see a frank assessment of self that displays a steeling resolve to dare the un-daring in the face of stifling glass ceiling.
A bold and intimate step forward from her previously published book, Oluneye tells of her travails and triumphs as she makes her way through the complex political maze in her beloved country, Nigeria. She holds nothing back and is not afraid to share emotional accounts of personal defeat, periods of brutal self-assessment, and that defining moment when she identifies her purpose in life. As she does so, she gives a fresh perspective to the much-talked-about change that Nigerians so deeply desire.
In Serve with Heart and Might, you find the curtains pulled back to offer a rare glimpse into the workings of the Nigerian political machinery. An unlikely politician, as Oluneye likes to describe herself, she explores themes such as maintaining a balance between a purpose-driven life and family, true service to humanity, as well as recognizing when to quit when the ovation is loudest. She knows too well the message in William Shakespeares words All the worlds a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages, and the greatest mistake and danger in not discerning when to exit the stage. 
Oluneye does not spare you the details of unavoidable murky waters encountered in the male-dominated world of politics such as is obtained in Nigeria. She details encounters, experiences, and inspiring events that helped shape her political viewpoints and mould her into the woman she has become. As you walk with Oluneye in Serve with Heart and Might, you find nuggets of wisdom embedded in its pages. In a book the budding politician will reach for time and time again, Oluneye distils from her experiences of service in government the much-needed advice for the inevitable uncertain days ahead.
This straightforward, unambiguous, frank, and point-blank memoir raises the consciousness and conscientiousness of its readers to serve humanity with heart and might and sets them on a voyage where only the courageous survive and triumph." />
