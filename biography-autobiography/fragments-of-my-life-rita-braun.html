  <title>Fragments of My Life - Rita Braun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Growing up in Poland in the 1930s, &lt;strong&gt;Rita Braun&lt;/strong&gt; had many hopes and dreams for the future. When she was nine years old, however, World War II touched her once-idyllic life, transforming paradise on earth into an indescribable hell. In Fragments of my Life, Braun tells her storyfrom her birth in 1930 to living in Brazil today, where she works to ensure no one forgets the more than six million Jewish people who lost their lives during the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including many photos, &lt;em&gt;Fragments of my Life&lt;/em&gt; provides firsthand insight into the horrors of the war. As a nine-year old on her school vacation, Braun watched as military aircraft streaked across the skies above her parents farm. She never imagined they would leave behind much more than a trail of smoke. This memoir details what she experienced as a Jewish girl trying to stay alive during World War II. Braun describes watching the selection process and deportation of friends and family, living under both Russian and German rule, using a fake identity, surviving in a gated and guarded ghetto, escaping and hiding for her life, and witnessing the many tragedies of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candid and detailed, &lt;em&gt;Fragments of my Life&lt;/em&gt; chronicles one survivors experiences from a woman of the final generation who can say, I lived through the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;" />
