  <title>Movie Stars Do the Dumbest Things - Margaret Moser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Johnny Depp. Marilyn Monroe. Marlon Brando.  Leonardo DiCaprio.  Woody Allen.  Shanron Stone.  What do all of these actors have in common?  They&#39;re outrageous, receive huge salaries, have enormous egos, and have way too much spare time.  Their out-of-control lifestyles prove that, as one Hollywood observer noted, &quot;Hollywood is a trip through a sewer in a glass-bottomed boat.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll learn which director was furious when he was misquoted as saying, &quot;Actors are cattle.&quot;  He claimed he had really said, &quot;Actors should be treated as cattle.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll discover that Bruce Wilis ordered the final scenes in Striking Distance to be re-shot at a cost of over $750,000 because the original shots exposed his toupee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll find that Melanie Griffith explained her ignorance of the Nazi holocaust by saying, &quot;I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t know.  Maybe I missed school that day...I&#39;m not stupid.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you&#39;re a fan of Hugh Grant, Dennis Hopper, or Whoopi Goldberg, you&#39;ll learn about all of the embarrassing moments in your favorite star&#39;s life.  From actors like Ben Affleck and Cameron Diaz to screen legends like Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland, &lt;i&gt;Movie Stars Do the Dumbest Things&lt;/i&gt; is proof that actors are more childish and impulsive than you&#39;ve ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;" />
