  <title>A Conversation About the Good Old Days - Doris C. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Other Side of the Story
	Growing up, I didnt have the best relationship with my Father.  Its ironic to mehow writing this book came about.  
When I was a child, I couldnt see, in my little eyes the love my father had for his children.  I could only see a Father that wanted to keep us from life.
Listening to his side of the story helps me to realize that it wasnt life that he was keeping us from but the world and worldly things.
My Father wasnt much of a talker back then, as a matter of fact, there was very little talk, especially when it came to who he was and what he had done in life.
Writing his story gave me a lot of information and answers to questions I had.  
The whywhatwherewhenand how was answered and explained.
One of the things I admired most of his story was howif he could do it againhe would do some of the things he done differently.  He saw/sees his mistakes.  We all have those moments where we wished we could turn back the hands of time.
Most of all, what I like about his story iswhere he gave his life to the Lord.  I see old men on the street daily.  I thinkthat could have been my Father.
How I am grateful that my Father accepted Jesus and his Lord and Savior.
I now understand in my big eyes my Father might not have been this or that but he was the main thingA FATHER.
Im proud of my Father and Mother and Im blessed to have had BOTH of them in my life.
