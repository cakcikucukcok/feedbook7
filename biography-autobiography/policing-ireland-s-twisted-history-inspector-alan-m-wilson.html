  <title>Policing Ireland’S Twisted History - Inspector Alan M Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ireland has long been a country of conflict. More than 400 years ago, the occupying English planted pre-Celtic Scots in the northern province of Ulster and divested the native Irish Celts of the land their ancestors owned for 2,000 years. This created a deep-seated enmity between the English and Irish, Protestant and Catholicand it finally exploded in the Troubles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Alan M. Wilson was on the front lines for the bloodbath that tore Northern Ireland apart from the late 1960s through the first years of the twenty-first century. Policing Irelands Twisted History reveals Wilsons remarkable, true story of growing up in Belfast and serving in the Royal Ulster Constabulary as an inspector and as a member of an elite anti-terrorism unit. Wilsons only goal was to help protect the innocent on both sides. Unfortunately, he became a target himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brutally honest and unflinching, Wilson traces his experiences serving Irelands divided society for nearly ten years. From watching friends die to the tit-for-tat murders occurring on the streets to staring death in the eye more than once, Wilson reveals the deep, gut-wrenching search for the meaning of it all in the midst of the worlds longest-running terrorist situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A firsthand look at the Northern Ireland conflict, &lt;i&gt;Policing Irelands Twisted History&lt;i&gt; offers an eye-opening, intimate examination of this devastating struggle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
