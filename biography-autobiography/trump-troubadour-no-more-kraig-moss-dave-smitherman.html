  <title>Trump Troubadour No More - Kraig Moss, Dave Smitherman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Early in the 2016 presidential campaign at a rally in Iowa, candidate Donald Trump looked directly from the stage at Kraig Moss, a supporter whose son had died from a heroin overdose. The crowd cheered as Trump pledged to end the heroin epidemic and praised Kraig as a great father. Moss was hooked. Attending 45 Trump rallies where he often performed songs written in Trump&amp;rsquo;s honor, Moss gained national media attention as the Trump Troubadour. Following the election, however, Moss was quickly let down by Trump&amp;rsquo;s unfulfilled promises.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Trump Troubadour No More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; tells the story of one man&amp;rsquo;s journey from Trump apostle to adversary. Interspersed with stories of his son&amp;rsquo;s life and death, this book captures the story of one ordinary American drawn to a presidential candidate who, despite his personal wealth and lavish lifestyle, seemed to understand common people and the struggles they face. Moss shares the euphoria of the election and inauguration and discusses why he believes the Trump presidency has forgotten people like him. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Trump Troubadour No More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; serves as a cautionary tale from a supporter who feels betrayed by a candidate who didn&amp;rsquo;t live up to his word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
