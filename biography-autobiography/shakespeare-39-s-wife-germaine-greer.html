  <title>Shakespeare&#39;s Wife - Germaine Greer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Little is known about Ann Hathaway, the wife of England&#39;s greatest playwright; a great deal, none of it complimentary, has been assumed. The omission of her name from Shakespeare&#39;s will has been interpreted as evidence that she was nothing more than an unfortunate mistake from which Shakespeare did well to distance himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Shakespeare is above all the poet of marriage&amp;#8212;repeatedly in his plays, constant wives redeem unjust and deluded husbands&amp;#8212;scholars persist in positing the worst about the writer&#39;s own spouse. In &lt;em&gt;Shakespeare&#39;s Wife&lt;/em&gt;, Germaine Greer boldly breaks new ground, combining literary-historical techniques with documentary evidence about life in Stratford, to reset the story of Shakespeare&#39;s marriage in its social context. With deep insight and intelligence, she offers daring and thoughtful new theories about the farmer&#39;s daughter who married England&#39;s greatest poet, painting a vivid portrait of a remarkable woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A passionate and perceptive work of first-rate scholarship that reclaims this maligned figure from generations of scholarly neglect and misogyny, &lt;em&gt;Shakespeare&#39;s Wife&lt;/em&gt; poses bold questions and opens new fields of investigation and research.&lt;/p&gt;" />
