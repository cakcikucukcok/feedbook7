      <meta name="description" content="Fifty Years of Gathering, Fishing, and Unusual Animal Encounters: Lessons Learned of a Michigan Outdoorsman is part of the culmination of author Joe Lunkas&#39; fascinating experiences during hid over 50 years as an outdoorsman. Artfully presented, organized, and integrated, these stories strongly convey the messages and their true meanings derived from his outdoor journey of learning.  This book will ignite the flame in the hearts and minds of both novice and veterans of the outdoors, infusing a deep appreciation, respect, and love for nature.
