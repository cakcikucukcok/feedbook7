  <title>True Story: Murder, Memoir, Mea Culpa - Michael Finkel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the haunting tradition of Joe McGinniss&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Fatal Vision&lt;/em&gt; and Mikal Gilmore&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Shot in the Heart&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;True Story: Murder, Memoir, Mea Culpa&lt;/em&gt; weaves a spellbinding tale of murder, love, and deceit with a deeply personal inquiry into the slippery nature of truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story begins in February of 2002, when a reporter in Oregon contacts &lt;em&gt;New York Times Magazine&lt;/em&gt; writer Michael Finkel with a startling piece of news. A young, highly intelligent man named Christian Longo, on the FBI&#39;s Ten Most Wanted list for killing his entire family, has recently been captured in Mexico, where he&#39;d taken on a new identity&amp;#8212;Michael Finkel of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, on page A-3 of the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, comes another bit of troubling news: a note, written by the paper&#39;s editors, explaining that Finkel has falsified parts of an investigative article and has been fired. This unlikely confluence sets the stage for a bizarre and intense relationship. After Longo&#39;s arrest, the only journalist the accused murderer will speak with is the real Michael Finkel. And as the months until Longo&#39;s trial tick away, the two men talk for dozens of hours on the telephone, meet in the jailhouse visiting room, and exchange nearly a thousand pages of handwritten letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Longo insisting he can prove his innocence, Finkel strives to uncover what really happened to Longo&#39;s family, and his quest becomes less a reporting job than a psychological cat-and-mouse game&amp;#8212;sometimes redemptively honest, other times slyly manipulative. Finkel&#39;s pursuit pays off only at the end, when Longo, after a lifetime of deception, finally says what he wouldn&#39;t even admit in court&amp;#8212;the whole, true story. Or so it seems.&lt;/p&gt;" />
