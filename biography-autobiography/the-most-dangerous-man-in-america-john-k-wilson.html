  <title>The Most Dangerous Man in America - John K. Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rush Limbaugh is the most prominent figure in the conservative movement today. With almost 20 million listeners every week on more than six hundred stations, Limbaugh has a larger media platform than any other individual in the nation. And this is why he is so dangerous.  &lt;br&gt;     Despite refusing to uphold even the most basic standards of journalism, Rush has been given an extensive, wide-reaching platform with which to spew his venom. And spew it he does! In this book, author John K. Wilson uses the most damning evidence of all--Rush&#39;s own words--to deliver the ultimate indictment of Limbaugh&#39;s bankrupt ideology and how it embodies the decline of the conservative movement. &lt;br&gt;     Wilson catalogs the world according to Rush--from the political conspiracies to his disdain for scientific evidence and apparent love of racist, sexist, and homophobic stereotypes--and shows how the radio personality poisons any rational political rhetoric with an endless stream of slurs, lies, and intimidation. Most revealingly, the author demonstrates how Limbaugh&#39;s blustering, baseless proclamations and love for savage, personal attacks have had a chilling effect on both parties, as he viciously targets not only liberals but also any Republican who dares question one of his conclusions. Meanwhile, Rush&#39;s viselike grip on the political arena has created a media monster so powerful that even liberal commentators are forced to engage with him and his polarizing discourse.&lt;br&gt;     The Most Dangerous Man in America reveals Rush Limbaugh to be just that.  No matter what you thought about the man before, you will never feel the same way about him again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
