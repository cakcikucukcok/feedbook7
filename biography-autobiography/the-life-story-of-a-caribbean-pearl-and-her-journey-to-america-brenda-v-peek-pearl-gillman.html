  <title>The Life Story of a Caribbean Pearl and Her Journey to America - Brenda V. Peek, Pearl Gillman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A child is born in the West Indies. She is sweet, inquisitive, bright, sensitive and caring  all qualities that she will maintain for many, many years to come. The sister islands of Trinidad and Tobago are among her earliest homes. She lives and learns in the most beautiful and popular areas of all the Caribbean, where rich legacies and history precede her: Once ruled by both Spain and Britain, today Trinidad and Tobago are governed by their own proud people, whove kept the traditions and culture of their ancestors since long before the islands found independence in 1962. Located just off the coast of South America, these small territories have developed an identity throughout the years that is completely their own. Dr. Eric Williams, the legendary Caribbean scholar, became the first prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, which is one of the most diversely populated ethnic regions in the world. People of African, Native West Indian, Asian, and European descent live, love and mingle together on these lovely islands in the sunshine.
English is mainly spoken among residents, but one will often hear traces of Creole, African and other language dialects in the colorful words and rhythmic accents of those who reside there. And when it comes to rhythm  its hard to mention the islands without mentioning the lively calypso sounds that have entertained countless music lovers throughout the western world. Hearing them, the child one day becomes a woman who is told she naturally walks to a calypso beat.
As far back as 1498, explorer Christopher Columbus named Trinidad in honor of the Holy Trinity, and it remains a place where worshipers, many of whom are Catholic, give praise and thanks to the Creator. With more than one million people on both islands, the majority of inhabitants live in Trinidad, while about four percent of the population calls Tobago home. Trinidads major event is the Carnival, a week-long festival of live music, costumes and parades through the street. The event attracts people from throughout the world. In fact, both islands are visited by travelers from around the globe, who enjoy pleasant weather, beaches more beautiful than postcards, tropical trees and delicious home-grown fruits.
With generations of people tracing roots to the area, Trinidad and Tobago have become not only a visitors destination, but a cradle to which great scholars, entertainers and athletes in America and elsewhere often return. This cradle in the Caribbean has given birth to the Gittens family. It has provided the earliest sights, sounds and sensibilities that influenced that special little child born into the family, a daughter who will become known as
Black Pearl." />
