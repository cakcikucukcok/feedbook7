  <title>Short Life in a Strange World - Toby Ferris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sure to be hailed alongside &lt;em&gt;H is for Hawk&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hare with Amber Eyes&lt;/em&gt;, an exceptional work that is at once an astonishing journey across countries and continents, an immersive examination of a great artist&amp;#8217;s work, and a moving and intimate memoir.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2012, facing the death of his father and impending fatherhood, Toby Ferris set off on a seemingly quixotic mission to track down and look at&amp;#8212;in situ&amp;#8212;every painting still in existence by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, the most influential and important artist of&amp;#160;Northern Renaissance painting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result of that pursuit is a remarkable journey through major European cities and across continents. As Ferris takes a keen analytical eye to the paintings, each piece brings new revelations about Bruegel&amp;#8217;s art, and gives way to meditations on mortality, fatherhood, and life. Ferris conjures a whole world to which most of us have probably lost the key, and in the process teaches us how to look, patiently and curiously, at the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Short Life in a Strange World&lt;/em&gt; is a dazzlingly original and assured debut&amp;#8212;a strange and bewitching hybrid of art criticism, philosophical reflection, and poignant memoir. Beautifully illustrated with sixty-six color images, it subtly alters the way we see the world and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
