  <title>Christmas in Heaven - Cecelia Leeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book tells the true story of the tragic, unexpected death of my daughter Laura on Christmas Eve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
During her twenty-one years of life, I always tried to protect her. Her death made me feel so helpless. I was at the mercy of the unknown. This cancer-eating pain in my heart was destroying me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She was not of earth anymore, so now I began to desperately search all of creation to find her. I could not rest until I had answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Did I really need to find God?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Do angels really come and assist us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Do miracles really happen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Do dreams really take you into another dimension?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Was Laura trying to reach out to me beyond the boundaries of death?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I was bewildered to see the hustle and bustle of the world survived the death of my daughter. Why did she have to die? Was she alive in another dimension, or was she just dead? A child cannot die and expect a mother to live. Then I attended an apparition of Blessed Mother which changed my life. Through this conversion of faith that I attained, I found answers, and the pieces of the puzzle started to fit together." />
