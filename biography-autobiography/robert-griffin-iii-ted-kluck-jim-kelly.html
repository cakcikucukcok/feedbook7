  <title>Robert Griffin III - Ted Kluck, Jim Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Robert Griffin III exploded onto the NFL scene with a style and flair anything but typical. With a Heisman Trophy on his mantel, RG3 entered professional football in 2012 under a spotlight that glowed beyond his own team, the Washington Redskins. Could the Baylor graduate electrify the NFL as he had the college game? Could he return a fabled franchise to the realm of elite Super Bowl contenders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Ted Kluck deepens the reader&amp;rsquo;s connection to a man who became the face of a revered NFL franchise before his twenty-third birthday. One player fueled by infectious enthusiasm for his craft. One man whose authenticity somehow seems to match his otherworldly skills on the gridiron. RG3&amp;rsquo;s focus on victory stood second only to the wisdom of his father: &amp;ldquo;Remember faith first.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Kluck follows RG3&amp;rsquo;s career from the very beginning. In addition, he dives into RG3&amp;rsquo;s relationships with and comparisons to players such as Tim Tebow, Michael Vick, Marcus Lattimore, Kyle Shanahan, Randall Cunningham, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Robert Griffin III&amp;rsquo;s story surpasses standings and statistics. Succeeding as a professional athlete is a challenge of the first order. Thriving as a cross-cultural phenomenon is the foundation of legends.&lt;/p&gt;" />
