  <title>The Love Lives of the Artists - Daniel Bullen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;As the oldest of institutions, marriage seems outdated in modern times, when each individual is encouraged to break with tradition in order to fulfill him- or herself. And so artists like Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo seem to be paving the way toward a brave, new kind of marriage, where spouses would be allowed&amp;#151;even encouraged&amp;#151;to fulfill different aspects of themselves in outside relationships. Shared creativity, they believed, would transcend their jealousies and compensate their sufferings: through art, they would rise above conventional marital fidelity, and prove a higher fidelity to art and to themselves.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Love Lives of the Artists&lt;/I&gt; tells the stories of Rainer Maria Rilke and Lou Andreas-Salom&amp;#233;, Alfred Stieglitz and Georgia O&#39;Keeffe, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, Diego and Frida, and Henry Miller and Ana&amp;#239;s Nin&amp;#151;five couples who approached their relationships with the same rebellious creativity as they practiced in their art.
