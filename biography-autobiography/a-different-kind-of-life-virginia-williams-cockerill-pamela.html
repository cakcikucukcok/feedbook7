  <title>A Different Kind of Life - Virginia Williams, Cockerill Pamela</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Frank Williams&amp;rsquo; team was on the verge of winning the Formula One World Championship for the third time when his life was turned upside down.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The racing car builder was on his way to the Nice Airport on a spring afternoon in 1986 when he lost control of his car, suffering horrific injuries in a crash that left him a quadriplegic. For his wife, Ginny, the accident meant taking on new and unwanted roles as head of the household and family decision-maker, while also struggling to overcome the anger and grief she felt after the accident.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In&lt;em&gt; A Different Kind of Life, &lt;/em&gt;Ginny tells her story with honesty and humor, set against the glamorous backdrop of Formula One racing. She documents life before and after the devastating accident &amp;ndash; from falling in love with Frank at first sight to learning how to cope with his needs after he became severely disabled but remained fiercely independent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A testament to the power of compassion and perseverance, &lt;em&gt;A Different Kind of Life&lt;/em&gt; is a moving and inspiration story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
