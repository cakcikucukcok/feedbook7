  <title>I Am My Father&#39;s Daughter - Maria Elena Salinas, Liz Balmaseda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Five nights a week, Mar&amp;#237;a Elena Salinas looks into a television camera and delivers the news to millions of television viewers. But when the newscast is over, she is like so many other women across the country: a wife and a mother, struggling to find balance between her personal and professional life. When Mar&amp;#237;a Elena accidentally discovers her recently deceased father had once been a Catholic priest, all she knew was suddenly thrown into question. Turning her investigative eye on herself for the first time, she begins a long, arduous journey for answers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;I Am My Father&#39;s Daughter&lt;/em&gt;, Mar&amp;#237;a Elena tells the amazing story of her journey to the top amid her struggle to come to terms with family secrets. From her childhood in a poverty-stricken neighborhood of Los Angeles and her adolescent years spent working in a sweatshop, to her astonishing break into network television, along with her coverage of some of the world&#39;s major events and disasters, Salinas frames her life behind the camera in the same warm and straightforward tone that is her on-air trademark. &lt;/p&gt;" />
