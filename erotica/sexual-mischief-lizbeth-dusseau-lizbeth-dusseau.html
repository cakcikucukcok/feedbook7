  <title>Sexual Mischief -  Lizbeth Dusseau, Lizbeth Dusseau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On a sultry day in June, Sausony walks away from a patronizing husband and her life of affluent leisure, seeking a cure for terminal boredom, hitchhiking with anyone who&#39;ll have her. Blonde, beautiful and foolish, she has no clue what risks she takes. Sexual fantasies turn real, when she&#39;s crudely fucked by a trucker in the back of a tavern, and later spanked before a cheering audience at a highway reststop. When her naivefriendliness is mistaken for sexual solicitation in a one-horse town with a backwoods sense of justice, her sixty-day sentence takes twisted turns she&#39;s not ready for. Her stint behind bars begins with a vulgar jailer taking advantage of his pretty inmate, followed by a degrading physical exam. When she briefly manages to escape, she&#39;s brought back to face tough lessons in obedience. Tied to the bars of her jail cell, she endures a &#39;night from hell&#39; as the subject of a cruel gang-rape. When she finally freed, it&#39;s clear that Sausony&#39;s jail time wasn&#39;t enough abuse to satisfy her driving need. Landing in LA, she&#39;s quickly lured by the leather and dungeon crowd, exploring submissive desires she yearns to experience. Her sensuous innocence attracts plenty of attention and the sex she craves. But she&#39;s dangerously out of control, until a concerned black Dom, an accomplished master of slaves, halts her downward spiral. If she wants to play in his world, she&#39;ll first learn the true meaning of submission. Then, under his guidance and protection, he&#39;ll take her to the depths of her shameless masochistic craving. While she may fight his methods, she knows he&#39;s exactly what she needs. And when he orders her to do the unthinkable, she&#39;d be wise to muster the courage to obey." />
