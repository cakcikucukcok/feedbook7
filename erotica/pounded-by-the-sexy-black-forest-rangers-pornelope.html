  <title>Pounded By The Sexy Black Forest Rangers - Pornelope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Allie gets caught out in a howling blizzard, she doesn&amp;#39;t expect to be rescued by a sexy black stud who handcuffs her to his bed, then demands her innocence in repayment for saving her life! Even if she meets his outrageous demands, will she survive the explosive encounter...especially when another sexy forest ranger shows up to join in the fun?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Icy sweat broke out all over when Allie tried to move her arms, and couldn&amp;#39;t. She was securely handcuffed to a sturdy bed frame.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caine began to shimmy out of his wet pants. She choked on what she&amp;#39;d been about to say, and goggled at him in disbelief. What was he doing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At least his long shirt provided some modesty; it hung over his briefs, front and back, like an ebony curtain. If she really looked, she could see...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But she didn&amp;#39;t want to! She didn&amp;#39;t want to see any part of him; she didn&amp;#39;t want to be anywhere near him!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I won&amp;#39;t hit you again, I swear!&amp;quot; She&amp;#39;d have promised to pull the moon down from its orbit just to escape this nightmare. &amp;quot;Please...let me go!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He eyed her for a long moment, and she wondered at the sudden glint in his dark eyes. &amp;quot;No, I don&amp;#39;t think so.&amp;quot; He drawled it with a slow grin that made her nerves sizzle with renewed terror. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve got a helluva good swing, and I don&amp;#39;t trust you not to do something stupid. This way, I&amp;#39;ll know exactly where you are when my back&amp;#39;s turned.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But I have to pee!&amp;quot; She nearly wailed it, and jerked so vigorously on the handcuffs that they bit into her wrists. &amp;quot;Ow!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Serves you right.&amp;quot; He considered her a moment longer, then turned to spread his wet clothes near the fire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Was Caine really a forest ranger? How did she know he was telling the truth? He might be an escaped convict, for all she knew. The handcuffs could have been stolen when he&amp;#39;d broken out of jail, or...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sternly she reined in her imagination. Whoever he was, he&amp;#39;d clearly saved her life. She owed him the courtesy of a fair hearing before passing judgement on him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He didn&amp;#39;t look like a forest ranger...but then what did a forest ranger really look like? She was pretty sure they didn&amp;#39;t really dress like Smokey the Bear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was pretty sure they didn&amp;#39;t wear silky black dress shirts, either, though. Or skintight black briefs!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly aware that her gaze had drifted down, she stared around in rising panic for her own clothes. Where were they?" />
