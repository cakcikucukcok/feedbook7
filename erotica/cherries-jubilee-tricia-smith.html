  <title>Cherries Jubilee - Tricia Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jessica thought she had it all: a loving husband she could trust, good friends, and a safe, happy home. But the illusion is shattered when she learns that her husband, Jade, is far from the perfect man. In one awful moment, her ideal life comes to a screeching halt.
Once she discovers that he is, in fact, an international drug dealer who destroys the lives of innocents, she challenges himand his violent reaction hospitalizes her. Wounded more in soul than flesh, Jessica is determined to survive. But Jades revenge is far from over. The hit man he hires leaves Jessica to die in a pool of her own blood. While in this darkness, she forms a plan. 
She will build a new life, starting with a new name: Haley Hedman. 
Haley is unstoppable. She gets the job of her dreams, where she meets her dream man. On the day she locks eyes with Chase Robard, time stands still for both. Chase is everything she desires, but there is something about him that could only be described as sinister. 
As she builds a new career and reputation, Haley rewards herself with a quick trip to San Padre Island, where she hopes to find a few playmates. Luckily for lustful Haley, the island is brimming with sensual, unforgettable, and adventurous opportunity. 
Its just what the doctor ordered!" />
