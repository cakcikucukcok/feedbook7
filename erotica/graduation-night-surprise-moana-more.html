~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~
This was the worst night of my life. Sitting here in a cold campus security office.
Nick was there though. Nick was Mom’s ex. They had been together for a few years while I was growing up.
When I got accepted at University, I knew it would bring me closer to him. Mom felt a little better sending me away to a University knowing that Nick was in town.  I remember that warm safe hug, my head pressed against his strong, firm chest, his smell, that of a man who was confident and accomplished everything he set his mind to.
“Miss, miss,” The security guard said. “Someone is here for you.” I couldn’t believe my ears.
I walked out of the office and standing there was Nick. “Wow, he did get my message.” I thought.
“Let’s go.” Was all he said and we got into his SUV.
I felt that I had let him down.
The seat felt so good, I could melt right there in those leather seats. As I sat there, I felt him looking at me. I was so shy though. He had always been such an authority figure in my life. Distant yet somehow the rock that I could always count on, or could I?
What made things even more complicated were his damn good looks. He’s aged well and it shows. Even at my graduation, the brief but warm hug I could feel his broad, firm and strong chest against my soft cheek. His wide shoulders and thick, muscular arms held me close and for that short moment in time, protecting me against the world that I was about to enter.
Tears started welling up in my eyes. “I’m so so sorry, Nick,” I said.
“You know, you have bigger problems than what happened tonight, don’t you?” he said.
“What do you mean?” I asked.
“Well, you lack discipline. You’re never going to make it in this big bad world without it.” he answered concerned.
“Discipline? Really?” I asked curiously.
God he was hot! Just looking at him steering the wheel, a man in control. I started to blush, all these feelings from deep inside just started bubbling up." />
