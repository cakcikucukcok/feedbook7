&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Charlie felt his face grow fire-engine red. Jasmine&amp;#39;s straightforward lust was something completely new to him. It wasn&amp;#39;t sleazy, like some of the movies he used to watch on cable. Instead, it was simple and matter-of-fact, totally without guile.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d ask you what you like,&amp;quot; she said softly. &amp;quot;But I&amp;#39;m pretty sure you don&amp;#39;t know yourself. So how about we take it slow.&amp;quot; She gave a throaty chuckle. &amp;quot;This is going to be fun. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever been with a virgin before.&amp;quot; One eyelid winked suggestively. &amp;quot;So I don&amp;#39;t have any bad habits to train you out of.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Bad habits?&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh you know,&amp;quot; she said, weaving her fingers with his. With startling nonchalance, she placed his hand on the swell of her breast. &amp;quot;Some guys think they know everything, and don&amp;#39;t listen. And other guys are so scared of doing the wrong thing you have to do everything for them. But you...&amp;quot; she trailed off. &amp;quot;By the time I&amp;#39;m done with you, Charlie, you&amp;#39;re going to be an amazing lover.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Leaning back, she pulled the t-shirt up and over her head. Two wisps of white lace, one at her breasts, the other at her groin, caressed her mocha-colored skin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Now,&amp;quot; she said, her voice amazingly calm and controlled, considering the situation, &amp;quot;the first thing to do is to get you out of these clothes. And then we can go to my room and make love.&amp;quot; She stood, her hand drawing him up with her. In an instant, her fingers were unbuttoning his shirt. He tensed as her fingers made their way inside and stroked his skin. They felt feverishly hot, but her actions were slow and gentle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Charlie was shivering with pleasure and fear. This was not what he had imagined his first time would be like. Rather than the culmination of weeks of planning after a wedding, he was being seduced by his dead wife&amp;#39;s daughter. His eyes feasted on her incredible body, seeing for the first time what he had known unwillingly. Long, slim legs melded into a pair of subtly curved hips, the white lace of her highcut panties emphasizing her slender waist. Above, her stomach was flat, the dimple of her navel winking at him saucily. The delicate fan of her ribs morphed irresistibly into the lovely curves of her breasts, standing out high and proud from the wall of her chest, obviously not needing the negligible support of her filmy bra.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Thirty-six C,&amp;quot; she said, catching his look. &amp;quot;A little smaller than Mama&amp;#39;s, but then,&amp;quot; she shrugged, &amp;quot;I haven&amp;#39;t had any babies yet. They&amp;#39;ll probably get a bit bigger when I do.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I wasn&amp;#39;t...&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s all right, Charlie,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;Men like to know.&amp;quot; She stepped closer, until he could feel the heat of her body. &amp;quot;Would you like to go to my room?&amp;quot; she asked quietly." />
