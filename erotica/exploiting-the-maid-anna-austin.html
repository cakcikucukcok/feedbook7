  <title>Exploiting The Maid - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alice is a young maid, new to her job. She he has heard that her new master, Lord Ashdown, is a stern disciplinarian. But nothing has prepared her for his true nature.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the handsome Lord requires total submission from all of his maids, and Alice is about to be taught a lesson.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Tell me, Alice- have you ever been touched?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What do you mean by that?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;By a man.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I thought back - of course I&amp;#39;d been touched by men before, albeit only in passing. Judging by the tone of his voice, Lord Ashdown was asking me whether or not I&amp;#39;d ever been touched by a man intimately. As soon as I realized this, I broke eye contact and stared awkwardly down at my feet. Of course, I had never been touched in that way before.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No. No, I haven&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Perfect! I prefer my maids to be chaste.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was unsure as to why he was asking me questions like this, seeing as this sort of thing didn&amp;#39;t really have a place in a work environment - and he was beginning to step closer to me. Our bodies were less than half a metre apart, and I was worried that he could hear how fast my heart was beating.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Now, I&amp;#39;m going to give you very specific instructions, and you have to follow them exactly. Does that sound alright to you?&amp;quot; Lord Ashdown inquired, and of course, a soft &amp;#39;yes&amp;#39; was all that escaped from my lips. My knees were knocking together with nervousness, my chest heaving as I struggled to catch my breath - when I&amp;#39;d lost it, I couldn&amp;#39;t remember." />
