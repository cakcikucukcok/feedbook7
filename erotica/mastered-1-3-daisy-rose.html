~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt From &amp;quot;Fighter&amp;#39;s Experiment&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I never thought I&amp;#39;d desire a woman the way I want you until I saw you in the fighting ring, Clarice,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My fingers whitened as I gripped the glass and brought it to my lips. I remembered belatedly that I finished the drink already. &amp;quot;You saw me fight?&amp;quot; I asked, my voice a breathless whimper.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His eyes hardened as his eyes met mine through the empty glass.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I was present at all your fights.&amp;quot; He leaned forward and moved the glass out of the way. &amp;quot;I would you to indulge me in a little... test of mine and then decide if you would like to go out with me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The air conditioning in the car must&amp;#39;ve been at full blast. I shivered. My tongue was thick. I struggled to swallow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What makes you think I would... indulge you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He grasped my hand in his and squeezed my cold fingers. Then, he drew them to his lips and brushed a light kiss across my knuckles. &amp;quot;You aren&amp;#39;t one to back down from a fight.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I gave a small smile. That was true. &amp;quot;What would I gain from it?&amp;quot; I asked idly. I rarely back down for fights since I was getting paid regardless of the outcome. But this- this was a fight I didn&amp;#39;t think I could win.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He looked down at me, surprise evident in his eyes. &amp;quot;Apart from pleasure?&amp;quot; he asked indulgently. He frowned, then poured himself another glass. We were doing a lot of drinking before sunset.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I could always get pleasure elsewhere,&amp;quot; I said idly, trying to adopt the same nonchalance he had and failing miserably. I didn&amp;#39;t even believe my own words.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The fact that you haven&amp;#39;t said no more about you than you care to admit,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was right. It probably said something about me that I enjoyed his control over me. I liked how painful his grip on my arm was when he pulled me into the car, or how he didn&amp;#39;t let my protests deter him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Would you like money, Clarice?&amp;quot; he asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; I answered almost immediately. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d like... I&amp;#39;d like your word that you aren&amp;#39;t doing this because it&amp;#39;s a game to you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;This is a game, Clarice,&amp;quot; he interrupted. His smile deepened. &amp;quot;But it isn&amp;#39;t one that will end with either of us losing.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I had no idea what he was going on about. I resisted the urge to walk away. The car was still moving. &amp;quot;Where are we going?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He named a French place I always drove past but never went into. It looked expensive, even on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But that&amp;#39;s not open in the afternoon.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He grinned. &amp;quot;My dear, everything opens for me.&amp;quot;" />
