  <title>The Corpse Wore Grey - Peter O&#39;Neill</title>
      <meta name="description" content=" One of the few books to be published under the Othello imprint, The Corpse Wore Grey is, as you might expect a mystery novel. A detective (actually, writer of detective fiction), is called into a rich man&#39;s hope for help in finding someone. While there, he meets up with the professor&#39;s daughter, and not a few other women along the way. There are fistfights, shootings, and a twist at the end. In reading this book, you have to admire the author&#39;s dedication in preparing his cross-over, but also think to yourself about the world that was changing. The hard-boiled paperback originals market of the &#39;50s was already in marked decline, sadly, or Mr. O&#39;Neill&#39;s work could perhaps be better known today. Though some might wonder why the sidekick got that much action...
