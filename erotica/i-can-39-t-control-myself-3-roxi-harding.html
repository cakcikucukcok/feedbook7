      <meta name="description" content="GET READY FOR THESE HOT FIRST TIME STORIES!
Inside you&#39;ll read about those princes of the house and the little brats they live with! They want to do it for the first time, and it always ends up being hard and without protection!
You&#39;ll need a cold shower after this!
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~
A movie plays on the TV as Tyler and Cynthia, his 18-year old stepsister, watch.
It&#39;s a lazy day, and Tyler&#39;s got his feet up on the coffee table. He did hardly any work today, which is just fine if you ask him. You need to take a break and enjoy yourself every now and again, you know?
Cynthia&#39;s feet are on the couch, her knees tucked up to her chin, her arms wrapped around them. Her eyes are trained on the screen, watching the events unfold in front of them.
Cynthia&#39;s noticed that her stepbrother keeps looking at her. He only does it when he&#39;s certain she&#39;s not looking, but she&#39;s noticed. And at first she felt weird, but now she kind of likes it. The thought of him unable to stop himself from looking at her. She slips a glance his way too, checking out his strong arms and large, masculine build.
&quot;Whoops,&quot; Cynthia says, dropping some of their snack onto the floor.
She and Tyler get up and search for the food, but it&#39;s underneath the couch.
&quot;Damn it,&quot; Cynthia says when they both stand up. &quot;Should we move the couch and get it?&quot;
&quot;Nah,&quot; Tyler says with a shrug. &quot;We can clean it up tomorrow.&quot;
Cynthia smiles up at her stepbrother, and he smiles back down at her.
&quot;You know,&quot; Tyler says to his stepsister. &quot;I must say I&#39;m glad we&#39;re alone right now.&quot;
&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; Cynthia says, and she looks up at her stepbrother, giving him the cutest smile. &quot;And why&#39;s that?&quot;
&quot;Because,&quot; Tyler says, looking right into his little sister&#39;s eyes. &quot;When we&#39;re alone ... nobody knows what&#39;s going to happen.&quot;
He smiles, and he sees Cynthia take a small gasp before smiling too.
Without thinking, she leans forward and wraps her arms around him, embracing him in a hug. Tyler&#39;s body stiffens up at first, but Cynthia keeps herself where she is, holding him close to her. After a few seconds he starts to relax and he in turn wraps his arms around her. They hold onto each other tightly, neither one speaking as they hold each other, their bodies pressed closely together.
Cynthia can hear her stepbrother&#39;s breathing next to her ear, can feel his body expanding and contracting as he inhales and exhales slowly, rhythmically. She runs her hand up and down Tyler&#39;s back and he does the same to her. She can feel his hold on her tighten slightly as he pulls her infinitesimally closer to him.
When she relaxes her body he relaxes his as well, which Cynthia takes as a sign to pull away. However, as she slowly moves her body back, her cheek grazes against Tyler&#39;s, their heads still next to one another&#39;s. She slows down and so does he, and she can feel his stubble against her face.
They continue slowly moving back and Cynthia can feel her heart begin to beat hard in her chest. Soon she feels her lips brush against her stepbrother&#39;s, and she turns her head slightly toward his. He does the same and their lips linger together for a moment that stretches on to eternity. Cynthia closes her eyes and moves her head forward, pushing her lips into her stepbrother&#39;s, kissing him. She feels Tyler&#39;s lips purse out as he kisses her back, the two of them held together, frozen in that state.
