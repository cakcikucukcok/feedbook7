  <title>Christian Whore - Shaliza Ali</title>
      <meta name="description" content="E XCITING, RIVETING, SENSUAL, incomparable, intoxicating, eye-opening, soul-soaring, mystical, ravenous, deep-rooted, informative, exhilarating, and thrilling.   One of the best books of the century, hair-raising and self-defining. 
The story of Laila Rania Shah is one for the ages, erotically entrancing love and hardcore sex scenes make for a phenomenal bedside thriller.
 Our temptress/evangelist takes us on a topsy-turvy, heart-palpitating, hair-raising journey into the exotic  life of an aristocratic Mumbai trophy wife. The author recounts and trails us into the timesuspending, boundarybreaking love affair of the protagonist with an uncommonly liberated, uninspired pained soul celibate priest, whose heart beat anew, after her touch came into his embrace.
The reader can expect to delve into the esoteric mysticism of Rania and Sachia formidable mother-and-daughter team heaven bent on the World dominance of the hearts, minds, and souls of their admirers. This complicated yet mysterious woman paints her life to us, yet she keeps every secret of her heart stored into her being. Come along and witness a woman telling a tale of love and romance without revealing a single shell of herself! A woman who is a misjudged and misconstrued lover of God.  A woman with a soul wanting nothing else but to be accepted by the society she is forced to live in, and yet having to be strong enough to withstand the worldly judgment of her decisions influenced by the cards that life threw at her.
Laila, our Christian whore, stood fast and held strong unto her love for the Lord when others would have failed, died, or even taken their own lifeor worse, their faith in love and God.
This remarkable woman and intoxicating storyteller shows us a unique type of perseverance. She shows the stamina and beauty of the true essence of grace. She describes and reflects our hidden and obvious desires. I deeply say that the kingdom of God should be proud of this fictional yet surreal character that lives a piece in all of ussmall and big, male and female, young and old." />
