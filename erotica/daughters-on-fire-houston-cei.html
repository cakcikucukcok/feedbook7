~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Flora and her friend Pamela were enjoying each other&amp;#39;s company at Manresa Beach in Watsonville on one of the Golden State&amp;#39;s beautiful summer days. As they were sharing conversation Flora said, &amp;quot;We both have so much to be thankful for and I was just thinking that maybe we could share some of our blessings.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With a puzzled look on her face, Pamela said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m all for sharing with my best friend, namely you, but I&amp;#39;m wondering if you have some particular &amp;#39;blessings&amp;#39; in mind.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Flora grinned and said, &amp;quot;It just so happens I do. First of all, you and I are very sensual and it was I who had a hand in your finding interest in incest. Sophia has her whole family of four and now with my brother home on leave, I have the same. It&amp;#39;s been two weeks and I haven&amp;#39;t even introduced him to you. So how about it? He&amp;#39;s cute but short on words. I think you&amp;#39;ll get along just fine. Would you like to try a thing with just you, me and him?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well, you&amp;#39;ve avoided the word &amp;#39;threesome&amp;#39; so there I&amp;#39;ve said it. I was wondering when you were going to introduce me. I guess you&amp;#39;ve been having a great time.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Flora laughed aloud and said, &amp;quot;Okay, I&amp;#39;ll set it up.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pamela then said, &amp;quot;I would love to have sex with you and your brother. I&amp;#39;ll take you at your word that he&amp;#39;s good lookin&amp;#39; and we&amp;#39;ll get along. My father and I have a very special relationship and I will have to clear it with him first. Trust me, it will be okay.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Flora threw caution to the wind as she bluntly told Lamar about the plan to have a menage a trois with Pamela. He had a bright smile on his face when he asked, &amp;quot;Is something like this really okay at a first meeting?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;She is very much like I am,&amp;quot; Flora answered. &amp;quot;Need I say more?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pamela set the time for the upcoming Friday evening which would be Mr. Winston&amp;#39;s Pinochle and Poker night with the last of the old high school friends still left in town. Flora and Lamar showed up at the Winston&amp;#39;s home at almost 7:00 pm for a light dinner as planned. Both guests were wearing shorts, tee-shirts and sandals. Pamela wore the shortest of short skirts with a backless, sleeveless, low-cut in the front blouse. Immediately after greetings, Pamela planted a tender welcoming kiss on Lamar&amp;#39;s lips and said, &amp;quot;My dad bought us a bottle of white wine to go with dinner.&amp;quot; Neither of the three were heavy drinkers so there was more than enough to get them tipsy and relaxed for rich conversation. Once Lamar voiced out with a few ribald jokes, the girls laughed aloud and they contributed to the conversation words of a sensual nature.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The wine and the talk set the mood for love. After dinner, Pamela poured three small glasses of brandy. As they were sipping the cocktails, each person was wondering who would make the first move of a physical nature. Pamela opened the door when she said, &amp;quot;Lamar, I&amp;#39;m sure Flora has told you that my father and I are lovers. Sometimes it seems like we are man and wife, but we are very liberal or else this evening wouldn&amp;#39;t be happening.&amp;quot; She then stood up to remove her scanty blouse to toss it aside.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;How about those babies?&amp;quot; Flora said to Lamar in reference to Pamela&amp;#39;s beautiful, bouncing..." />
