  <title>Love and Hate Will Bring You to Your Knees - Lyric Nolan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Old love is hard to leave behind when youre in love with Rick Tyler, one of Los Angeless most elite and popular lawyers. Hes every womans dreamtall, dark, and handsome, albeit a bit arrogant. Now living in Washington, DC, he wants his east coast lover, that belongs to the mafia, by his side.  But, could she be nothing but trouble?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, theres Tina Black, Ricks former lover who he left behind in LA. She feels betrayed by her ex, and she wants to make it clear their relationship is not over. Tina, though, has a dark secret that could bring about enough pain to ruin all the people he loves. Which woman will ultimately win Ricks heart, and does he really have any say in the matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love and Hate Will Bring You to Your Knees is a topsy-turvy, hectic ride into the heart of true love. Anyone who has experienced love before will recognize the struggles that befall a man with his heart on the line. We cant help whom we love or the people who love us, but one thing is for sure: theres always drama when money, fame, and reputation are at stake.&lt;/p&gt;" />
