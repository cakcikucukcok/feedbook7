  <title>Crazy: A Short Story - Missy Richland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Morgan Stanley is a tough sort of girl who doesn&#39;t sugarcoat the truth. She wants a lot in life-in particular, she wants to be loved. When the sexy Franklin walks in and sweeps her off her feet, she thinks she might have found just the man for her. He shares her passion for life and the bedroom ... but Franklin is not what he seems.   As time passes, things take an unexpected turn for the worse. Morgan ends up pregnant, carrying Franklin&#39;s child, but their relationship only grows darker as Franklin becomes more overbearing and jealous. When Morgan finds herself locked behind asylum doors, she begins to question not only her sanity but also the man she loves and the life they&#39;ve built." />
