  <title>Yes, Doctor! - Ella Louise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Curvy, shy Claire goes to the doctor for an embarrassing problem: she can&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking about sex! Though she knows her problem is unusual, the last thing she expects is for the gorgeous Dr. Kent to take her treatment into his own hands &amp;ndash; and mouth. Not even this voluptuous BBW&amp;rsquo;s modesty will keep her from wanting Dr. Kent to take her in every hole!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Claire?&amp;rdquo; the nurse calls from the doorway. &amp;ldquo;Sorry about the wait.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I stuff my book - the latest self-help tutorial that isn&amp;rsquo;t really helpful at all &amp;ndash; into my purse and stand up at the sound of my name. Self-consciously, I tug the hem of my skirt down farther, trying to stretch the fabric to cover more of myself. The skirt comes to my knees, but I suddenly want to hide behind as much fabric as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Relax, I tell myself, forcing a deep breath. No one but the doctor has to know why you&amp;rsquo;re here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I step through the threshold that separates the waiting room from the corridor of examination rooms. The nurse, a tired-looking woman in her forties, leads me to exam room four.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m relieved that she doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to want to take my weight. I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up a habit of nervous snacking, and have put on some pounds lately. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to see the numeric evidence staring me in the face on the scale. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a big girl, but the closet full of suddenly-too-tight clothing at home is all the guilt I can handle right now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Have a seat,&amp;rdquo; she gestures to the paper-covered table without looking up from her clipboard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I climb onto the table as gracefully as possible, but I still manage to tear a huge gash in the paper. The loud ripping noise sets my nerves even more on edge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Your chart says you&amp;rsquo;re experiencing sexual issues?&amp;rdquo; Her voice is dry and disinterested. I know she&amp;rsquo;s expecting the usual vaginal dryness or pain during intercourse. I can&amp;rsquo;t bring myself to admit that my reason for being here is quite different." />
