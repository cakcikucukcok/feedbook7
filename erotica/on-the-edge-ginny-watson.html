&lt;br /&gt;
Blackmailed.&lt;br /&gt;
Cassie made a drunken mistake during a wild hen night, she thought she had gotten away with it... until a photograph arrived in her email inbox, along with a strange demand, a demand she isn&amp;#39;t sure she can fulfill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sharing Ava&lt;br /&gt;
Liam is a cuckold, a happy and contented cuckold, and his wife is more than enthusiastic to help satisfy his fantasy, male or female she is happy for her husband to watch. But Liam doesn&amp;#39;t know she also has a fantasy... and he is about to be put on the spot!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Amber&amp;#39;s Cam&lt;br /&gt;
Amber loves her webcam, and being an avid exhibitionist she loves to play with all the horny guys, teasing them with a kinky display of her goodies... but never her face. But that is about to change as she agrees to meet one of her anonymous regulars Dave. Is she about to get a shock when she finds out who he really is!" />
