  <title>Futa Farm Girl - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jackie is content to spend her life alone. But when an attractive young woman stumbles out of a storm, she can&amp;#39;t turn her away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Danielle is confused by Jackie&amp;#39;s wary attitude. But when the hot young lesbian discovers Jackie&amp;#39;s secret, she can&amp;#39;t hide her desire. The lovely futa-woman has the body of a supermodel, and she&amp;#39;s a virgin too!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Danielle watched the struggle play out across Jackie&amp;rsquo;s face. She held her breath, not daring to upset the delicate balance between them. It was obvious the gorgeous woman was wavering the knife&amp;rsquo;s edge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Damn them for hurting her. The ferocity of her anger surprised her. But it was obvious that if Jackie had not been physically abused, she was recovering from a lifetime of emotional trauma. Danielle could imagine it. The signs were all about. Growing up in a small town, in a conservative household. Maybe her father died young. Or maybe it was yet another case of a man abandoning his unwed lover after she came up pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And then, the double blows to the mother. First, the unwanted pregnancy. And then, even worse to her eyes, the horrifying realization that her child was malformed, disfigured, a freak with both male and female genitalia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In all honesty, Danielle thought, it was almost surprising that Jackie was as well-adjusted as she was. If she had to live her life scorned and despised, she probably would have gone completely around the bend.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;God, I want her so bad.&lt;/i&gt; Hidden behind the ridiculous sweatpants, her womanhood gave a frustrated spasm. Her juices were flowing, making her lips hot and slick.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, Jackie opened her eyes. In her gaze, Danielle could see the haunting memory of years of hurt. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re not playing a trick on me?&amp;rdquo; Her voice quavered, half-hoping, half-fearing the truth. &amp;ldquo;You really think I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;m attractive?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Danielle stood. This, she knew, would take a careful touch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She laid her palms on Jackie&amp;rsquo;s cheeks, meeting her eyes squarely, willing her to see her honesty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You,&amp;rdquo; she whispered hoarsely, &amp;ldquo;are the most amazing creature I have ever seen in my life. And I would be honored if you allowed me the gift of taking your virginity.&amp;rdquo;" />
