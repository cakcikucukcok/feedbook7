  <title>Taken In Public By The Transit Strangers - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dominic knew she was the one from the moment he laid eyes on her. He was going to fondle her, strip her, and take her hard. All before learning her name.
Olivia lost much more than her undergarments when she stepped aboard the early Sunday train. The mysterious strangers on the transit awoke primal desires within her prim and proper exterior.
Welcome aboard the Chikan Train, where women are stripped, fondled, fingered, and taken hard by sexy alpha males in every way imaginable.
This standalone short is a steamy tale with mmf, voyeurism, reluctant exhibitionism, and more.
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~
&quot;Mind if I sit here?&quot;
A deep voice shook me from my nap and I was startled awake.
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to scare you.&quot;
My eyes drank in every detail of the man before I can stop them. He was wearing a black suit that managed to illustrate his perfect form. The dark color accentuated his hair and skin, making him almost glow in the darkness. He was holding onto a black suitcase in front of him, hiding his pelvic region unintentionally.
I gulped as my eyes took in the white button-down shirt beneath the black suit that clung beautifully to him. The clothing hugged his broad shoulders and tapered down to a narrow waist.
By the end of my eye-candy feast, I was salivating and had forgotten his question entirely.
&quot;Do you mind if I join you, ma&#39;am?&quot; he repeated his question and I nodded numbly, unsure of whether I should say &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no&#39; to make him stay. There was a smirk on his face that implied he knew exactly what was going through my mind.
I felt my cheeks grow hot and the throbbing between my legs started again as if it had never stopped in the first place. Yet, I still couldn&#39;t tear my eyes away from him. He was perfect.
&quot;You&#39;re really early and you don&#39;t seem to be dressed for work,&quot; he said, starting off the conversation despite all my staring.
I swallowed thickly and tried to keep my voice at an acceptable pitch as I responded, &quot;I&#39;m going to work actually. Casual will do since it&#39;s Sunday. What&#39;re you dressed up for?&quot;
&quot;Well, I was hoping to meet someone else here,&quot; he grinned. &quot;My name&#39;s Dominic,&quot; he offered an outstretched hand.
My eyes widened and I willed my heart to slow down, lest it beat its way out of my ribcage. It was thumping so rapidly I thought I was going to going to pass out. He was so close to me that I worried he could hear my heartbeat. His eyes were a beautiful shade of blue that I could get lost in forever.
Hesitantly, I took his hand in mine. When we touched, there was a sharp and potent stirring low in my abdomen. I kept my hand still and tried not to sweat buckets. Even through his firm grip I could feel the masculinity radiating through him and the hard muscles on his arms. I felt my insides twitch and I knew I was in trouble.
&quot;Are you feeling all right?&quot; he asked, leaning closer. He held my hand so tightly in his that I could only squirm uncomfortably and try not to whimper in fear. He was so close that our breathes were mixing. I inhaled at his every exhale, drinking in his scent like a lost sailor starved for water. The concern was evident in his ocean-blue eyes, but there was a curve of his lips that betrayed the amusement he felt at the reaction he was getting out of me.
&quot;I&#39;m fine, thank you,&quot; I squeaked, berating my body for being so weak for him to elicit such a strong response in me. I tried to convince myself that the fierce flare of yearning that I felt was from the name he shared with the mysterious article that I had read this morning and not because of how much I wanted his lips on my fevered skin, savoring every inch of me.
