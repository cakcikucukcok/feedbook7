~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I um... I&amp;#39;m Kira? I&amp;#39;m here with someone?&amp;quot; she asks, tugging her dress a little self-consciously. She wonders if the woman can tell that she&amp;#39;s not used to wearing a dress this tight out in public.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He had the dress delivered to her that morning with instructions to wait for someone to pick her up at six thirty. She should be worried that he has gotten a dress that is exactly her size, but then, he&amp;#39;s seen so much of her already so she tells herself not to care. The dress is an utter dream, hugging her in all the right places without making her look like a cheap whore, like she did the other night. She is still blushing from the residue embarrassment of being seen in the dress at all. It flares out at her hips and stops at a respectable length at her ankles. It is padded enough around her breasts that she doesn&amp;#39;t need to wear a bra and the material is clingy on her hips, so she went without underwear too, remembering how he mentioned liking her without it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It had felt like a good idea at the time. Now though, with the woman&amp;#39;s scrutinizing eyes on her, she feels bare and naked. She resists the urge to fidget. She stands still allowing the woman to stare her while staring right back. She may work here, but she didn&amp;#39;t need to be so pompous about it. Kira doesn&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;ll like the woman at all, not if she judges everyone based on how they&amp;#39;re dressed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The woman eyes her suspiciously, looking her up and down as her eyes are capable of valuing everything she has on her. Kira feels like she actually does. If this was a cartoon, money signs would replace her eyes. She&amp;#39;s ridiculously glad Mr. Smith chose the dress for her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The woman must&amp;#39;ve recognized the dress, because the next words out of her mouth is, &amp;quot;Reservations?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She catches herself from gaping. &amp;quot;It should be under John Smith?&amp;quot; Now that she&amp;#39;s said that name out loud, she&amp;#39;s pretty sure it&amp;#39;s fake. What kind of parent with &amp;#39;Smith&amp;#39; as their last name would name their son-&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Ah, you must be the lovely companion Mr. Smith has warned us about,&amp;quot; the woman says.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She doesn&amp;#39;t catch her gape in time this time, staring at the woman like a fish out of water for a full second before she pulls herself back and stands tall. &amp;quot;Yeap!&amp;quot; She hates herself for popping the &amp;#39;p&amp;#39; like a five year old. And then, she makes it worse by adding a too-enthusiastic, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s me!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The woman smiles that fake smile she&amp;#39;s seen a million times in the mirror when she&amp;#39;s practicing for scholarship interviews. &amp;quot;Come this way,&amp;quot; she says.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kira congratulates herself for not falling on her butt as she manoeuvres her way behind the tall woman on heels that are probably designed to kill her feet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She guides her into a large hall where patrons are already in the middle of their meals. A few eyes glance up to look at her as she slides past them, but she keeps her own eyes firmly ahead of her. It&amp;#39;s not like they can tell by just looking at her that she doesn&amp;#39;t belong here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She expects to see him in one of the seats, but they keep walking past the tables and then they&amp;#39;re going through doors and she&amp;#39;s suddenly inside a room with Mr. Smith at the large round table with only one other chair on the opposite side of the table.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She&amp;#39;s a little disappointed at the distance between the two chairs, but she figures the space would keep their hands to themselves and out of trouble." />
