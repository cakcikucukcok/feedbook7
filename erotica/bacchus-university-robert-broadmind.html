  <title>Bacchus  University - Robert Broadmind</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Universities are normally conservative institutions. In this book they are not. The professors depicted in this imaginary institution exceed conventional norms. They go all out in their seeming quest for propagation. They exemplify the shadow side of our culture. Their braininess is fully compensated by their horniness. The male and female professors in this book engage enthusiastically in all kinds of normal, abnormal, experimental, experiential and orgiastic sexual activities. Dionysus , the Greek God of fruitfulness, would fully approve. 
Young and older readers will find inspiring images and detailed descriptions of specific acts of love-making that will help them overcome the normal boundaries of morality and allow their secret wishes to come to the forefront. The protagonists depicted here overcome the restrictions of conventional morality  shame, marriage and personal love. The pair gets enlarged to a trio, the trio to a quartet, the quartet to an octet. The bodies merge into a single body; the boundaries between heterosexuality and homosexuality get exceeded. Anything goes." />
