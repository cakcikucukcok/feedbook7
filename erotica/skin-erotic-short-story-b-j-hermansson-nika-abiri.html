  <title>Skin - Erotic Short Story - B. J. Hermansson, Nika Abiri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I want to kiss you. Every single pore and every part of your body, both big and small. And I want to do it for a long time. You’re like a doll, so innocent. Smooth, silky and soft – complete without a beginning or an end. I would even want to taste you. I wake up in the middle of the night, thinking about you. I want to be near you.&quot;
She can tell that he is something out of the ordinary the first time they meet. He is a bit shy, and his dark eyes are secretive and mysterious. He is incredibly sexy. Even though she thinks that there is something different about him, she is fascinated by the sexual tension between them. It doesn’t take long before she finds herself out of her comfort zone – and something doesn’t feel quite right...
Skin is an erotic thriller that tells the tale of thrilling sex, forbidden fantasies and questionable motives." />
