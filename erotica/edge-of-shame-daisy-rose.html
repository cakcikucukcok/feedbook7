  <title>Edge Of Shame - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Addie admits her deepest, darkest fantasies to her husband, she doesn&amp;#39;t expect him to make them come true. The inexperience young woman doesn&amp;#39;t just want multiple male lovers in her bed, she wants them to be rough and more than a little violent. She wants to be tied down and used until she begs them to stop, only for them to continue despite her protests until she cries out her safeword.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re serious?&amp;quot; I stared and stared when he nodded. &amp;quot;You won&amp;#39;t be... jealous?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Maybe a little at first,&amp;quot; he admitted. &amp;quot;But I&amp;#39;ve tried swinging before with my exes and it&amp;#39;s really arousing,&amp;quot; he grinned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Swinging?&amp;quot; I murmured, confusion thick in my voice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Swinging,&amp;quot; he nodded sagely. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s when a couple isn&amp;#39;t exclusive, allowing their partners to have intercourse with other people.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh,&amp;quot; I hummed. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve done it before?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He grinned. &amp;quot;Yeah.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wondered if I wanted to know details. I knew he had been... promiscuous before we met. He was handsome, rich, and eloquent. It was the perfect combination. When we started going out together, he promised to put it all behind him. He wasn&amp;#39;t getting any younger and he wanted to settle down.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It makes things in the bedroom a lot more fun,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;But I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve tried a rape-roleplay scenario before. It&amp;#39;ll be exciting!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A peculiar thought crossed my mind, one that I voiced instantly. &amp;quot;Are we going to have women too?&amp;quot; I asked. &amp;quot;I mean... Would you want...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He shrugged. &amp;quot;If you want to, sure. I&amp;#39;m not too keen about sharing you with other women,&amp;quot; he said and I found myself blushing harder. &amp;quot;Girl on girl doesn&amp;#39;t really do it for me,&amp;quot; he explained. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m much more interested in watching you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;How &amp;#39;bout you and erm... other men?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He shook his head. &amp;quot;Not particularly interested in that either.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I heaved a sigh of relief. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d want to share you yet,&amp;quot; I whispered quietly. Cain was my first everything and I wanted to keep him for myself for a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m good with that,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Any other rules?&amp;quot; he asked like we were discussing the weather." />
