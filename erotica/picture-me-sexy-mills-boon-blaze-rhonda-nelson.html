  <title>Picture me Sexy (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) - Rhonda Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Delaney Walker has a secret. The celebrated designer of erotic lingerie is actually too &quot;nice&quot; to wear it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when her fiancé says &quot;I do&quot; to someone else, Delaney decides to change her image. And she&#39;s going to start by going through with the boudoir photos she&#39;d arranged for her groom-to-be. Only, little does she guess that once photographer Sam Martelli sets eyes on her, he&#39;ll insist on putting himself in the picture….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sam has photographed hundreds of beautiful women, but none have affected him like Delaney. Even before she strips down to just a whisper of silk, casting off her inhibitions as well as her clothes, he has to have her. And thanks to a power failure, he does…again and again. But once the lights come back on, can Sam convince her that their one night was more than just a case of indecent exposure…?&lt;/p&gt;
