  <title>Stepbrother: Hot and Heavy - Scarlet Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mel is 23 years old. And she&amp;#39;s never been with a man. Tonight, she&amp;#39;s going to do something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;That&amp;#39;s what the internet is for, right? Quick, guilt free hook-ups. It doesn&amp;#39;t take long for her to find a man who&amp;#39;s more than willing to relieve her of her innocence. And if he resembles her hot stepbrother Jesse? Then all the better.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;But Mel is in for a surprise. Turns out that her online mystery man bears more than a passing resemblance to Jesse&amp;hellip;and that he can&amp;#39;t contain his taboo desire for her!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;The message read - &lt;i&gt;Hey, hot stuff. Wanna meet up?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;I clicked on his profile before replying. I&amp;#39;d hate to accept the first guy to write me, only to discover he was twice my age and overweight.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;My heart skipped a beat - the name on the profile read Jesse. Obviously it wasn&amp;#39;t actually him, but this had to be something of a sign, right? Whatever god was up there wanted me to give this guy a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;I scrolled through his pictures - no face, just his body. It was the sort of body you&amp;#39;d see in magazines, completely toned and completely tanned to perfection. I had to actively keep myself from drooling. This guy was definitely the one I wanted my first time to be with. Hurriedly, I flicked back to the messages screen and typed out a sloppy reply.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sure. Do you have time tonight?&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp; I wrote, hoping that I didn&amp;#39;t sound too eager.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yeah. I can meet you in about 30 minutes if you&amp;#39;re free.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Shit - thirty minutes? That was way too soon - did he want to meet at my place? I&amp;#39;d have to get it all clean first, plus I&amp;#39;d have to shower. I didn&amp;#39;t want to scare him off, though. If he wanted to come in thirty minutes, then dammit, he was gonna come in thirty minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sounds good. Where do you wanna meet?&lt;/i&gt; I typed, fingers slick with nervous sweat and sliding clumsily over my phone screen. Thank god for autocorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;There&amp;#39;s a hotel nearby. It says here that you&amp;#39;re only 3 miles away from me, so you should be able to get to it no problem. I&amp;#39;ll send you a link.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;I clicked the link, and it opened up a familiar site - The Prestige. It was the nicest hotel in my city, and I&amp;#39;d never stayed there before. It was pretty close by, and dammit if I was gonna waste my chance to stay in such a nice place with such a hot guy!" />
