~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Edward always felt strange when he rang the doorbell to the house that was once his, but he was not about to the break any rules or put his ex-wife to the test by just walking in or even showing up unannounced. Immediately after opening the door, Beverly saw her father standing in the doorway still in his business suit with over-night baggage. Beverly threw her arms around his neck and in child-like fashion kissed him on the cheek.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Beverly and Edward walked arm in arm toward the living room, he asked, &amp;quot;So what&amp;#39;s up?&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#39;s Friday night. Don&amp;#39;t you have a date?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Not really,&amp;quot; she responded. &amp;quot;I knew Mom was going away with her jerk of a boyfriend so I thought we could goof off together.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Does that mean I&amp;#39;m your date?&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; he asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I guess you could say that. We could sit and talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll fix you dinner, and we could watch TV, or whatever,&amp;rdquo; she answered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well, that sounds okay, but I think your date should take you out on the town. I can dance to the same music you like and now that you&amp;rsquo;re twenty-two, I can take you to the night clubs,&amp;rdquo; he said with a spark of enthusiasm. Beverly was excited by the offer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Beverly dressed semi-formal in a powder-blue, knee-length evening gown and was looking as attractive as a Cosmopolitan cover girl. Over the past two years of life as a bachelor, Edward had learned how to show a lady a good time, and that was exactly how he planned to treat Beverly; like a lady, rather than a daughter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The evening began with a candlelight dinner at a high-end restaurant where Edward was well-known as a good tipper. Beverly was overwhelmed by the attention they received as a couple by the ma&amp;icirc;tre d and the wait staff. She knew the cocktails, the wine and the meal had to cost a bundle and felt she had to say, &amp;ldquo;I appreciate all this, Dad, but I&amp;rsquo;m just you daughter, not a movie star.&amp;rdquo;" />
