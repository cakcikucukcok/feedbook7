  <title>Cisco Knocked A Baby In My Fertile Womb - Studly Stallion</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Coming home from college, I saw that my parents had sold everything on the farm. Every sheep, goat, chicken, everything. I raced into the barn to see if my baby, Cisco, had also been sold!&lt;br /&gt;

Excerpt:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was 18 and returning home from college for a Thanksgiving family reunion. Everyone would be there. Other than my parents and brother, I missed my pinto stallion, Cisco, the most.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I pulled into the driveway, eager to see my family and burst through the front door.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mom! Dad! Bro! I&amp;#39;m home!&amp;quot; I sang out to a dark house.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At first I thought it was a surprise where they&amp;#39;d jump out and yell my name. After a few moments, though, I knew they weren&amp;#39;t here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Where could they be?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Flicking on the light to the kitchen, I noticed a note on the island. Reading it I flung it back on the counter and raced outside.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The note said they&amp;#39;d sold everything to pay off the debt. All the cows, equipment and horses. They assured me they&amp;#39;d have enough money to start over next year.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Had they sold Cisco? My heart pounded in my chest as I flung open the barn door.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Cisco!&amp;quot; The word caught in my throat. How could I live without my stallion?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My voice danced along the empty stalls of the stable. I waited, wondering the unthinkable question of my stallion&amp;#39;s fate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A welcoming neigh greeted my ears. Cisco! I raced to his stall not believing what I&amp;#39;d heard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Cisco!&amp;quot; I bolted to his stall at the end of the barn and hugged my horse, Hot tears trailed down my cheeks as joy flooded through me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He nuzzled my cheeks in greeting. I was so glad to see him here. At last he was here and not sold.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He nipped at my clothes and ripped off my shirt. I giggled so glad to see him, so I allowed him to do it even though I shouldn&amp;#39;t have.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What are you doing?&amp;quot; I laugh cried.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He waved my shirt around and dropped it on the ground. He always was a joker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He pawed the ground and shook his head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You naughty boy.&amp;quot; I scolded him, wagging my finger in front of him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He snorted." />
