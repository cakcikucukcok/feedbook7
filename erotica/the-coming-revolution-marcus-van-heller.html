  <title>The Coming Revolution - Marcus van Heller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alvaro&#39;s sole desire was to free his people from the dictator&#39;s power. There was only one place for him to turn, The Black Caiman, a secret revolutionary guerrilla army. Trying to reach them, he first fell into the hands of Marita, the tall, sensuous black dancer whose mouth both made and fulfilled promises. Then there was Kim, English but definitely not cool, whose luscious body was to both give and receive torment as she worked to help him. And there were others in the secret army who knew there was more to pain than suffering. This is not a book designed for the faint of heart.
