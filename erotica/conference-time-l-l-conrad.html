  <title>Conference Time - L.L. Conrad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On her way to a national conference in San Antonio, Texas, Tory Stanton considers ways she could vanish from her dull and dissatisfying life, leaving her husband and children behind. She dreams of just once doing something unusual or even crazy-like having wild, passionate sex with a man who is not her husband. Chris Enns, one of the conference organizers, is drawn to Tory the moment he sees her. They flirt and then hook up, intending it to be a one-time event. Next year, when they meet again at the same conference, things have changed-but Chris and Tory still cannot deny their attraction. Over the course of the next few years, they get together annually, at each conference, exploring their sexual limits. But when fate intervenes and they learn hard truths about each other, can they find a new relationship based in more than just sex? In this erotic romance, two people who hook up yearly at a conference must find another way to make their relationship work." />
