  <title>Never Forgotten - Alana Hart, Marlena Dark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The hunt to find investors to save Megan&amp;#39;s software company is a tough one, and when one of the potential investors turns out to be her ex boyfriend, Sal, who disappeared years ago, it all gets messy and complicated. Megan married again after Sal&amp;#39;s disappearance, and that&amp;#39;s on the rocks. Nothing that&amp;#39;s going on in her life helps. And Sal&amp;#39;s story is even more complicated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Megan Cross drew in a breath and then let it out slowly as she looked around the room, taking in the sober and confused looks on the faces of the three people sitting around the conference table. The expressions she saw told her that none of them entirely understood, and they expected her to explain it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fundamentally, the situation was simple enough. As always in business, it was the whys and wherefores, the scope of the problem and what it meant that made it hard to lay out in a way they could all understand. In short, Diamond Software had run into a problem that needed a solutionand soon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now she was putting the current situation into context, gaining perspective. It was, after all, only a logistical matter, a question of shuffling future cash flow into a current project. That was what financial types were for. Her task was to find the right financial type. Dealing with financing was her weakest area... she&amp;#39;d damn well have to learn. It seemed to be a recurring need and a job she couldn&amp;#39;t delegate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As that thought resonated the doorbell rang, and she went to answer it, opening the door and seeing Thom standing there. &amp;quot;So you came.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I usually do.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Except when you don&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Certainty is overrated. It leads people to make dangerous assumptions.&amp;quot; That made her smile. Uncertainty defined their relationship, was its watchword, and that suited two busy executives. Thom didn&amp;#39;t even own a home and was always on the move. As well as investing in Diamond Software, Thom managed investments around the world, flitting, at a moment&amp;#39;s notice to Germany or France, or even Montana. The relationship evolved rather spontaneously. He made a point of being in town for Diamond&amp;#39;s monthly board meetings, and one night she&amp;#39;d invited him to come by for a drink.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She liked his company, enjoying the difference between Thom and the men she usually encountered. He was interestingan attractive novelty. Despite the twenty years difference in their ages, there was a sexual attraction they were both willing to pursue. Quickly his coming to see her after meetings became something of a ritual interrupted only when Thom or she had other business that couldn&amp;#39;t be put aside for the evening. For them both, the business was important. The sex was casual. A bonus for them both.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He came into the room moving with his customary grace. His kisses were delicate, touching her lips like a flower, even when they were insistent. He commanded attention through. He was delicious, and his presence almost fragile yet he wasn&amp;#39;t at all frail. He touched her arms, and she moved against him, her breasts against his chest as he ran his hands down her back. She tingled with delight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She led him into the living room, and he spotted the open bottle of wine from the table and picked it up, glancing at the label and wrinkling his nose. &amp;quot;I should&amp;#39;ve brought something decent. I knew money was a problem, but I didn&amp;#39;t realize things were this bad.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t pretend to be quite such a wine snob. I rather like this one. It tastes good, and I can buy it at the supermarket on my way home from the office.&amp;quot; She wanted to say more, but his attention had moved on. The moment was gone." />
