  <title>Dominated By Three Marines - Virginia Bliss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lily thinks she has got what it takes to join the marines. But when she turns up at the recruitment center, the marines decide that Lily deserves some hard military discipline.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The three hot, alpha male marines are going to give her a taste of their weapons. They are going to dominate her, all three of them at once, rough, hard and without protection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The man behind the desk was extraordinarily handsome, albeit in a very rugged way. His jaw was chiseled, dotted with stubble - it was obvious that he cared not about his appearance, and yet he managed to be effortlessly attractive all the same. For a plain girl like myself, this trait was extremely enviable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His hair was dark and cropped short, likely for practical reasons - it wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense to have long tresses whilst doing grunt work or going into combat. I tugged at my shoulder-length hair self-consciously, wondering if I seemed unprofessional. I sat down at the chair that faced the desk, watching as this man&amp;#39;s deep blue eyes bored into my own. He hadn&amp;#39;t said a word yet - meaning it was up to me to break the silence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hello-&amp;quot; I started, voice cracking with nerves, causing the intimidating man before me to grin a little - it was not a lighthearted grin, rather one filled with malice, malice that shook me to my core. I was quite certain that I was going to be made fun of and sent packing very promptly, but there was something inside of me that told me to persevere, to be persistent, to do anything it took to be recruited." />
