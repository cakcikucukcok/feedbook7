  <title>The Cuckold Path - J.C. Wittol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On the surface, Nick has it all: a beautiful wife and family, and a great job. His life is one of clear skies, calm waters, and smooth sailing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just over the horizon, however, a wave is building that threatens to change his entire life. A harmless trip to a swingers club, an attempt to try something different, leads them to Collin. The handsome, rich black man immediately enthralls Nicole, his gorgeous Latin wife, and the feeling is mutual.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What follows is an exciting, gut-wrenching ride for everyone&amp;mdash;especially Nick, who has to come to terms with his wife&amp;rsquo;s infatuation for a man who desires her. Nick is faced with a choice: remove Collin from their lives and risk his wife&amp;rsquo;s happiness, or allow Collin to remain in their lives, and risk his marriage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We stayed for a little while longer, and Nicole danced with a few other guys, but the energy that we&amp;rsquo;d felt earlier left with Collin. Only thirty minutes had passed since he left, and she mentioned she&amp;rsquo;d like to go home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;We need to talk anyway,&amp;rdquo; she said as we left.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once we got on the road, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait any longer. &amp;ldquo;You wanna help me understand your behavior tonight?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;God, I&amp;rsquo;m so embarrassed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She buried her face in her hands for several seconds, but when she faced me again I could see more excitement than embarrassment. I wondered if she was about to beg for forgiveness, or ask for permission to do it again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, honey,&amp;rdquo; she started and put her hand on my shoulder. &amp;ldquo;I got carried away tonight, and I apologize.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah, you caught me by surprise. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think we were going to become swingers tonight.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re not,&amp;rdquo; she assured me. &amp;ldquo;I love you and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to swing with random couples we meet in a club. That just doesn&amp;rsquo;t interest me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay,&amp;rdquo; I dragged the word out. &amp;ldquo;What does interest you? You seemed to really like Collin, but he&amp;rsquo;s a single guy, and I thought&amp;hellip;..well shit, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what I thought, or you thought, or we thought. Ugh! I&amp;rsquo;m so damn confused, baby. What hell are we doing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She stared out the window for a few minutes before turning back to me. &amp;ldquo;Do you really want to know what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking? Honestly. Do you really want to know, because I love you and don&amp;rsquo;t want to hurt your feelings, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to jeopardize our marriage?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Jeopardize our marriage? When did our marriage get put on the chopping block?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Somewhere along the way, we&amp;rsquo;d jumped into the deep end of the pool and felt like I could barely tread water. Our marriage was fine when we left the house, now it was in jeopardy?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry; I&amp;rsquo;m not expressing myself well. I just,&amp;rdquo; she trailed off.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Just what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I just want to be honest with you, but I&amp;rsquo;m afraid you won&amp;rsquo;t want me anymore.&amp;rdquo; Tears glistened in her eyes. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll be ashamed of me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I love you, Nikki, and I absolutely want you to be honest. Always. Please tell me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay.&amp;rdquo; She wiped her eyes before continuing, &amp;ldquo;I had a discussion with Suzie. We&amp;rsquo;re in the same yoga class. Anyway we had lunch a while back and she let me in on a little secret. Her husband used to go out of town a lot on business, and their sex life suffered. She told me they used to fight a lot, and almost divorced, before they worked out an agreement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What type of agreement?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She took another breath. &amp;ldquo;Suzie has a boyfriend.&amp;rdquo;" />
