  <title>Toys and Teasing 2 - Ella Louise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Unable to experience any sort of release for months, Tara has become desperate. Taking the advice of her good friend Erica, she grabs some promising toys, dons a sexy outfit, and heads out into public in the hopes that she will have the time of her life. Will Erica&#39;s exciting texts help Tara reach her ultimate goal, or will they leave her more teased and desperate than ever?
This story can be read alone OR as the second book in the Toys and Teasing series.
~~~~~  Excerpt  ~~~~~
We hang up, and I slouch onto my sofa.  I feel a weird mix of nerves and excitement.  Is this actually happening?
Might as well get ready.
I strip and step into the shower, letting the hot water pound on my back and steam up my bathroom.  Running my soapy loofah over my smooth body, I can&#39;t help but think of how long it&#39;s been since I&#39;ve felt any sort of release.  With a small shock, I realize it has been almost three months now.  No wonder I&#39;m tense.
Thinking about finally feeling that familiar sensation, the build-up and then the explosion, the climb and then the fall, the moment just before it hits…  My eyes close as the pounding water from the shower head massages my neck and shoulders.
