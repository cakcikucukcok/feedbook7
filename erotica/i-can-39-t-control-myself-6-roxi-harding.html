  <title>I Can&#39;t Control Myself #6 - Roxi Harding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="OMG…SO HOT!
I&#39;ve got 31 brand new stories for you! You want to read about a little brat and her first time with the prince of the house? Then you&#39;ve come to the right place!
You know you want it!
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
Carson stifles a yawn as he waits for Tiffany, his 18-year old stepsister, to come out and model some clothes for him.
She&#39;s gone through three outfits already and he doesn&#39;t know how many more he&#39;s got to see. But he likes what she&#39;s shown him so far, and he has to admit that she hasn&#39;t looked half-bad in any of them.
Carson watches as his little sister comes back into the room wearing a brand new outfit. A brand new, expensive-looking outfit.
&quot;Oh, wow,&quot; he says to her. &quot;Did you…get those on sale, kiddo?&quot;
Tiffany gives him a shrug.
&quot;No, I thought I&#39;d spoil myself,&quot; she says with a wink. Carson smiles, shaking his head.
Ever since she turned 18, Tiffany&#39;s been flaunting her sexuality around…but only around Carson, it seems. It&#39;s almost like the other guys in the neighborhood don&#39;t matter to her. He doesn&#39;t like to admit it, but he&#39;s had thoughts about Tiffany…mostly in his dreams, but thoughts nonetheless. And these thoughts usually culminate in him climaxing in his sleep, or having to whisk off to relieve a little tension in his bedroom.
But he knows that nothing will ever come of it. They&#39;re just thoughts, after all.
&quot;Thanks for letting me model these for you, Carson,&quot; Tiffany says, stepping up to her stepbrother.
She looks up at him, and he looks back down at her. His heart beats fast in his chest, and yet he doesn&#39;t move away. Tiffany stops right in front of him, her eyes locked with his.
Carson&#39;s heart won&#39;t seem to stop beating.
He wants to step back from his stepsister but he can&#39;t seem to be able to. He&#39;s stuck where he is, and she&#39;s not moving away either. Does she want him as much as he wants her? From the look of her eyes as she stares up at him, he&#39;s pretty certain he knows the answer.
Tiffany&#39;s heart suddenly begins beating hard in her chest. Her stepbrother is close…and he&#39;s not looking away. She can see the outline of his muscles through his thin shirt. And down below she&#39;s certain she can see a bulge at the front of his pants.
&quot;Do you think you&#39;ll ever want children, Tiffany?&quot; Carson asks his stepsister.
Tiffany shrugs. &quot;Maybe,&quot; she says. &quot;I&#39;m not sure. It&#39;d have to be with the right guy.&quot;
&quot;And…how do you know if you&#39;ve met the right guy?&quot; Carson asks her. He looks into his little stepsister&#39;s eyes, and she looks right back.
&quot;I think I&#39;d know,&quot; she says, her voice coming out on a breath. &quot;I think I&#39;d know.&quot;
She stares into Carson&#39;s eyes, and her eyes travel down to his mouth. She suddenly realizes how close he is, and she can feel herself leaning in towards him, wanting to be nearer. Tiffany sees her stepbrother lick his lips and she licks hers in turn. Without thinking, she leans forward and kisses him on the lips." />
