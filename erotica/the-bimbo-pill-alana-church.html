  <title>The Bimbo Pill - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Max&amp;#39;s mother is a brilliant scientist. But when she takes one of her new experimental drugs, she turns into a sex-crazed bimbo! Soon no one is safe from the influence of the Bimbo Pill. Not his sexy older sister, and not his ex-girlfriend. When one man has to satisfy three horny bimbos, anything can happen! And does!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He cleared his throat nervously. &amp;quot;How are you feeling, Mom?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She turned to him, her movements graceful and easy, and smiled. Something was missing, he thought. Some internal barrier which she used to guard herself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Just fine, honey,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m really horny, though.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He blinked. &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m horny,&amp;quot; she repeated, with amazing simplicity.&amp;quot;I haven&amp;#39;t had good sex in ages. Not since before your father left.&amp;quot; Her expression clouded in sudden anger. &amp;quot;Bastard. Stupid, selfish, needle-dicked little weasel. He said he couldn&amp;#39;t get it up for me. That I intimidated him.&amp;quot; She threw one of his dress shirts into the washer in a gesture of fury that was as frightening as it was sudden. &amp;quot;But it was just fine for him to sleep with every two-bit whore in town, wasn&amp;#39;t it?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He stared. He knew that his parents&amp;#39; marriage hadn&amp;#39;t been a happy one. But the raw, visceral rage behind his mother&amp;#39;s calm mask was shocking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I mean, look at me,&amp;quot; Veronica continued. She set her hands on her hips. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t I look good?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Of course you do, Mom,&amp;quot; he stammered, hoping to calm her down.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And I hate these clothes,&amp;quot; she said, changing subjects abruptly. She fingered her sweatshirt disdainfully. &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re just like the ones I wear to work. Too heavy. Too long. But I have to look pro-fesh-shun-ul,&amp;quot; she sneered..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her eyes lit. &amp;quot;I know what I&amp;#39;ll do! I&amp;#39;m going to put on different clothes! Fun ones!&amp;quot; She stabbed a finger at him. &amp;quot;Wait here!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His mother was down quicker than he would have guessed, but dressed in an outfit that made his eyes widen. Gone were the heavy jeans and the confining sweatshirt, the grubby old sneakers and the sensible white socks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Instead, she wore something out of a teenage boy&amp;#39;s fantasy. A pair of skintight denim shorts clung to the curves of her hips and rear, ending in a scattering of white threads which drew attention to her slender thighs. And instead of the heavy sweatshirt, worn and faded from innumerable washings, now she wore a button-down shirt, the tails knotted just below her breasts, the neckline open all the way to her cleavage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Do you like it?&amp;quot; she asked artlessly, her eyes pleading for his approval.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s very&amp;hellip;nice,&amp;rdquo; he said, trying to be tactful. &amp;ldquo;But don&amp;rsquo;t you think you&amp;rsquo;re going to get chilly?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s okay,&amp;rsquo; she responded cheerfully. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll just turn the heat up!&amp;rdquo; She bounced across the room to the thermostat and stabbed at one of the buttons. In seconds warm air began to pour up from the heating vents in the floorboards.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Much better,&amp;rdquo; she nodded. She spun back to him. &amp;ldquo;So, Max, what do you think? Am I attractive? Your dad didn&amp;rsquo;t think so. I tried wearing clothes like this to turn him on, after you and Linda went to bed.&amp;rdquo; Her eyes pooled with sudden tears. &amp;ldquo;I dressed like a whore for him. But nothing worked.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tears trickled down her cheeks and instinctively, Max reached for her. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s okay,&amp;rsquo; he said quietly, taking her in his arms. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s gone. You&amp;rsquo;ve got me and Linda. We love you, Mom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Do you?&amp;rdquo; she sniffled. &amp;ldquo;Do you really love me, Max?&amp;rdquo;" />
