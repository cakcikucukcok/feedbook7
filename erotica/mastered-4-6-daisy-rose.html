&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I want you to carry my child.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I stared at him in disbelief. &amp;quot;Certainly someone of your wealth and power can have anyone you want!&amp;quot; I exclaimed, honestly perplexed. I was a simple girl with no background, no ability to help him. Our children might end up taking after me and amount to nothing in life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, but then, it would be harder to hide the fact that I have no interest in most women.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My eyeballs were on the verge of falling out of their sockets. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re gay?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; he laughed. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not. But I&amp;#39;m not interested in most women.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;With all due respect, if you&amp;#39;re interested in mostly men, that makes you gay.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He laughed again. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not interested in most men either.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What are you interested in?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He shrugged, a bare lift of his shoulder that I would&amp;#39;ve missed if I hadn&amp;#39;t been staring at him as hard as I was.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What makes you think I&amp;#39;m not a gold digger who&amp;#39;d disappear on you the first chance I get? And honestly, you have the money to marry anyone you want,&amp;quot; I sighed. It was ridiculous that he would kidnap me, just to impregnate and then do the right thing and marry me. I didn&amp;#39;t believe him. &amp;quot;Why not try a dating app?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t believe in those things,&amp;quot; he said simply.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t believe in technology?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He smiled bitterly. &amp;quot;Not after the last time.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;So you prefer having your henchmen stealing girls away from your restaurant franchises?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I like the challenge,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When he stood up, I sank deeper into my seat, fear gripping my heart. Despite the earlier banter, I was afraid that he would follow through with his plan on impregnating me straight away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Are you afraid, Rosie?&amp;quot; he asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wondered how he knew my name, then realized he probably knew more about me than he let on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; I whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I would tell you not to be afraid, but that wouldn&amp;#39;t lessen your fear, would it?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shook my head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There was no glow of the city lights beyond the glass windows. We were too far from the streets to see even headlights from passing cars. Instead, there was just a pure blackness with only the moonlight to give us sight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You look beautiful in that,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I glanced down at the apron I was still wearing and blushed a bright red.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll look even better without it,&amp;quot; he whispered, towering over me. The light casted a shadow that loomed long beside him, like a silent monster waiting to make its move." />
