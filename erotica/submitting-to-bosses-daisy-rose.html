  <title>Submitting To Bosses - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nicky&amp;#39;s first day as a maid is turning out to be a lot dirtier than she anticipated. Not only is she expected to wear a skimpy maid&amp;#39;s uniform that barely covers anything with no underwear, she is required to surrender to her boss and all the employees in the office.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Humiliation and raw physical desire consume her body, mind, and soul as brazen hands breach her every defense and take her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What are you thinking about?&amp;quot; he asked, his voice feeling much closer to me than he was, so soft it was almost a whisper, but deep enough to vibrate through my bones.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly thought my nose, taking my time to completely empty my lungs before taking in air again, a meditative trick I had learned a few months ago in a free yoga class. It helped calm me down when I panicked, which I was very close to doing at that very moment, especially with him looking at me like that. &amp;quot;Nothing, sir,&amp;quot; I said truthfully.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He stood up and I took a tentative step back, trying to create a distance between us. That seemed to displease him. His lips tightened into a straight line and I held my breath as I waited for him to talk. The tension in the air made it hard to breath.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It didn&amp;#39;t help matters that the scent of his cologne filled my lungs, intoxicating my mind and body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I saw his eyes flick down and notice the change in my body. He appraised my body without shame. I continued standing up straight, resisting the strong urge to cover my chest with my arms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I like what you&amp;#39;re wearing,&amp;quot; he said, eyeing me up and down, drinking in the sight of my body, almost transparent against the white material and the short skirt that barely covered my anything. I tried to tug the skirt down a little more, but it was no use. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll be wearing this from now on,&amp;quot; he said with a tone that left no room for protests.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, sir,&amp;quot; I said, my voice barely above a whisper.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He leaned back against the desk, almost sitting on it as he folded his muscular arms over his chest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He exuded power. &amp;quot;Your work hours are clearly stated in the contract. Now, given that you had an early start today, I&amp;#39;m willing to excuse your behavior this time.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Thank you,&amp;quot; I breathed a sigh of relief.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Nevertheless, you should still be punished for your tardiness,&amp;quot; he said, walking around behind me so I couldn&amp;#39;t see him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My heart caught in my throat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt his breath against my ear and knew he was leaning close to me. Despite my nerves, I remained absolutely still, waiting for the sound of his voice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Stand up and lean over the desk,&amp;quot; he said finally." />
