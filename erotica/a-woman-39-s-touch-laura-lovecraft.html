  <title>A Woman&#39;s Touch - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="38 year old Linda has never had any interest in women. That is until one night when she and a friend unknowingly visited a club just for women. After watching the women dance seductively, Linda realizes she is becoming aroused and decides to stay. Things get even hotter for her when she enters the bathroom to see two women making out in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was six months ago, and all Linda has been doing is dreaming of and fantasizing about being with a beautiful woman. But she&amp;#39;s nervous and has no idea how to get started, so her fantasies have remained just that, and her frustration with herself is mounting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The closest Linda has allowed herself to get is her weekly massages where she lays there reveling in the touch of her sexy masseuse, Paula. Linda feels that since she&amp;#39;s married, Paula is a &amp;#39;safe&amp;#39; fantasy, and even occasionally flirts with her. What Linda is about to find out is that Paula, her safe fantasy, has some secrets of her own and is about to introduce Linda to what she so desperately craves: a woman&amp;#39;s touch!" />
