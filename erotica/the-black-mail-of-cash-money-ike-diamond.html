  <title>The Black Mail of Cash Money - Ike Diamond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cashus Moneyly worked hard all his life, and when he opened up his own bail-bond business, he played even harder. His wife put up with his late nights and early mornings for years before she took the kids and left him. The women and alcohol helped to numb Cash to the wrong he had done, but eventually his conscience got the best of him. Now on a mission to get his family back, Cash begins to take the steps needed, but not after one last fling. One more night of passion and then Cash would do the right thing. That one night will turn out to be the night Cash wishes he could take back. Now caught up with a younger woman, Cash is forced to make a decision. Lose the chance of getting his family back or continue to live with the black mail of cash money." />
