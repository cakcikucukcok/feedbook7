  <title>Mutual Desire - Donna Grant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a world where men and women come together to indulge in sensual delights, the most gratifying unions occur when mutual longings and attraction come together. Here, three women find intense pleasure as they satisfy their deepest desires.  .  .   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;The Hunger &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      Kate is a Scottish temptress who wants nothing but her freedom. When she is married against her will to a powerful laird, she vows to deny him--until his scorching touch unleashes primal urges she cannot control.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   &lt;b&gt;The Longing &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    The beautiful Linarra is sent to her tribe&#39;s archenemy as a peace offering, her body to be used as his sexual plaything. Once her new master claims her, Linarra discovers insatiable cravings that send her to the brink of wild ecstasy.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;The Pleasure&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  During an Amazonian adventure, willful Princess Arian is kidnapped and presented as an erotic prize for a jungle warlord, who turns her captivity into a sensual journey that awakens her body&#39;s most carnal demands.  .  ." />
