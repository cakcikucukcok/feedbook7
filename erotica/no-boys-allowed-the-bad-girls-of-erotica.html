&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Our Neighbor&amp;#39;s A Porn Star&amp;quot; by Alana Church&amp;nbsp; Heather Fawxx moved to a small town in the hopes that her adult-film past wouldn&amp;#39;t follow her. But her hopes were dashed when she was immediately recognized by her new neighbors. Now, the sparks of desire are igniting between her and sexy bi-curious Barbara. One thing is sure: Life is interesting when your neighbor&amp;#39;s a porn star!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Burning Love From A Queen Of Snow&amp;quot; by Ashley Berry&amp;nbsp; Elena could think of nothing worse than marrying a prince from the frozen north. But that was before she met the prince&amp;#39;s mother, Queen Janice Hendry, who burns passion that no northern blizzard can quell. For Elena to join the royal family, she must pass three of the Queen&amp;#39;s intimate, sensual tests. Elena loves playing with girls, but will she have what it takes to satisfy a Queen of snow?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Amore&amp;quot; by Alexa Nichols&amp;nbsp; What good is fame if you&amp;#39;re slowly, unavoidably, and undeniably losing your mind? Alicia is an up and coming model and internet sensation with an insane work ethic. What her fans don&amp;#39;t know, however, is that her always on personality is fueled by not only addiction but loss and tragedy on almost every level. The more famous she becomes, it seems, the more she loses&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mrs. Wilson&amp;#39;s Cure for Headstrong Ladies &amp;amp; Hysterical Wives&amp;quot; by Veronica Sloan&amp;nbsp; All Hubert wanted was an obedient wife that could zip her lip and be a pretty little homemaker. His Minnie sure is pretty, but she&amp;#39;s as obedient as a feral cat! She&amp;#39;s always mouthing off, breaking vases, and screaming about &amp;quot;her place&amp;quot; in a man&amp;#39;s world. When she crashes his Rolls Royce Phantom II, that&amp;#39;s the very last straw! Declaring his wife hysterical, Hubert takes her to the one woman that can cure any headstrong dame. Little does he know, Mrs. Wilson has zero interest in &amp;quot;fixing&amp;quot; Minnie and every intention of awakening her lesbian lust!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A Woman&amp;#39;s Touch&amp;quot; by Laura Lovecraft&amp;nbsp; Linda never had any interest in women until she walked in on two of them having sex in a bathroom. Now women are all she thinks about, but Linda is nervous and only fantasizes about it. Linda&amp;#39;s favorite fantasy is of her sexy masseuse Paula. Her massages are the highlight of her week and this one is going to be even more special because Paula knows just what Linda needs: a woman&amp;#39;s touch!" />
