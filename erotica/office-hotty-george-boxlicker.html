  <title>Office Hotty - George Boxlicker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Maxwell Strong thinks of the women at work as his seraglio, and the woman who is the hottest is Brandy. Until then, he had not made a move but, when she commits a serious error with the computers, that changes. He has his way with her, and plans to do it again. The first part may sound like harassment, but Brandy has her agenda. Strong doesn’t know, but she has as much fun as he. In the second part, she gains revenge for what the man tried to do and has done to others.
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
Brandy was the youngest and newest employee in the office, and just then, she was probably the most worried. Only 18 years old, just out of high school and on her first job for only a week, but even she knew the importance of the file and that it should never have been deleted. A more experienced white-collar worker might have been able to cover up her mistake, either laying the blame on some else or otherwise appearing innocent. However, Brandy was both naive and honest. She knocked on her supervisor&#39;s door, went in when ordered to, and confessed her mishap, telling him how sorry she was.
&quot;You did what!&quot; Maxwell Strong roared. &quot;Do you realize what this means? We are going to have to put in weeks of overtime to restore all the data you lost, and, even then, I&#39;m not even sure we can do it.&quot;
Actually, he was making that up. The company&#39;s information management department had sense enough that they would never have allowed such an important file to even exist without multiple backup. As soon as it was deleted, the mainframe had noted the fact and replaced the file with an exact copy. No harm whatsoever had been done. However, Strong was sure the young lady in his office didn&#39;t know that, or she wouldn&#39;t have even bothered coming to tell him about it.
He had been watching Brandy ever since her first day, not only to evaluate her work, but because she was such a beauty. He watched all the young hotties that worked for him, and she was the hottest of the bunch, tall, with long, light brown hair, big breasts and a gorgeous body. He hadn&#39;t gotten a good look at her face before, but he did so now, and it was just as pretty as her body was sexy, with a clear complexion, big, brown eyes and a very appealing mouth. As he looked at her, his main thoughts were to scheme how he could have sex with her, and he believed this was his chance.
Mr. Strong had been sitting in his swivel chair but he got up and, after locking the door, returned to stand in front of his desk, the better to confront and intimidate his intended victim. Although she was tall, he was well over six and a half feet from his black wingtip shoes to his iron-grey hair, and he towered over the hot young woman as he scowled at her. His paunch, although unattractive, did nothing to make him less imposing.
&quot;Well, what are you going to do about it?&quot; he asked. &quot;You&#39;re on probation here, aren&#39;t you?&quot;
&quot;Y-y-yessir.&quot;
He had known that, but he wanted her to say it. Everything was going fine, so far. &quot;Well, answer me. What are you going to do about it? I could fire you right here and now, you know. You&#39;re on probation and you really messed up. That&#39;s two reasons I could fire you, isn&#39;t it?&quot;
&quot;Yes, sir. I&#39;m very sorry, sir.&quot;
&quot;I asked you what you&#39;re going to do about it. Are you deaf as well as dumb?&quot;
&quot;No sir. I&#39;ll do anything you want to make up for it. Please don&#39;t fire me.&quot;
&quot;Why not? Why shouldn&#39;t I fire you after you messed up so royally?&quot;
&quot;Please, sir, I&#39;ll do anything you want if you don&#39;t fire me.&quot;
&quot;Anything?&quot;
&quot;Yes, sir. Anything.&quot;
That was what Maxwell Strong wanted to hear, and he was sure she meant it.
