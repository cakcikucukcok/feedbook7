&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I couldn&amp;#39;t decide whether to buy a mansion on an estate here in California or on the Florida coast,&amp;quot; Mason interrupted. &amp;quot;So I told a real estate agent to find me both.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Here and the Florida coast?&amp;quot; That was the most romantic line Roni had heard in a long time. Her pulse pounded with the anticipation of new love.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Wanna see?&amp;quot; Mason held out his phone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Roni accepted the phone and found a response from a real estate agent, acknowledging Mason&amp;#39;s requests for properties to buy. Her face flushed with affection for Mason as she gave the phone back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Maybe somewhere else,&amp;quot; said Mason. &amp;quot;Caribbean, Hawaii, who knows? Maybe I&amp;#39;ll buy a place in one of each.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;One of each?&amp;quot; Roni&amp;#39;s voice spiked in pitch as her pulse rate spiked with adrenaline. Galloping romance was in the air. In fact, her heart was downright fluttering.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Charlotte put one hand on her hip and cocked it to one side, posing for Rigby in her little black dress. &amp;quot;Maybe I should step out of this lil ol&amp;#39; thing.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Need any help?&amp;quot; Rigby gave his goofy laugh again. &amp;quot;I could give you a hand with that. Maybe two.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I think you better show them, guys,&amp;quot; Tessa said to Mason and Rigby. &amp;quot;They need to know before you go much further, if you know what I mean.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hold it,&amp;quot; Roni said to Tessa. &amp;quot;What are you doing here? You&amp;#39;re not involved with either one of them, right? Are you, uh &amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m straight,&amp;quot; said Tessa. She shrugged and nothing on her chest moved under her shirt. &amp;quot;And we agreed, it&amp;#39;s better not to mix our business partnership with a relationship. Why risk a good thing? So we&amp;#39;re platonic friends.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And you&amp;#39;re here because ...?&amp;quot; Roni asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m an objective observer for my partners.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Observer?&amp;quot; Roni looked over Tessa again. &amp;quot;Look, I understand some people like to watch, but I thought they were all guys. I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m going to be comfortable being observed. I&amp;#39;m not exactly into that sort of thing.&amp;quot; Roni really just wanted to understand these three. She had plenty of experience with men, but none of those guys were billionaires. They weren&amp;#39;t millionaires, either. For that matter, some of them had no source of incomebut she found out the hard way. Literally, in bed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I couldn&amp;#39;t decide between a Mercedes sedan or a Porsche convertible,&amp;quot; said Mason, interrupting. &amp;quot;So I&amp;#39;ve ordered limited editions of both.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Both?&amp;quot; said Roni, as a tingling started between her legs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Waves of romance swept over her, expunging Tessa from her concerns. &amp;quot;Why, isn&amp;#39;t that interesting, Char? Just theoretically speaking, for instance, if a girl wanted a Mercedes sports car convertible &amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Pocket change,&amp;quot; said Mason. &amp;quot;I can calculate that in my head. With over a billion dollars invested properly, that&amp;#39;s not even one day&amp;#39;s interest.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The tingling between Roni&amp;#39;s legs grew even more sincere.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What if a girl wanted a beachfront condo?&amp;quot; Charlotte asked Rigby. &amp;quot;You know, just for the scenery and all. And a place to run up and down the beach in a string bikini. Or less.&amp;quot;" />
