  <title>Milked by My Doberman - Jade Summers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Grace finally realizes she has a problem when her bras stop fitting her. She notices that her breasts have been growing larger every day and have become incredibly sensitive and she doesn’t know how to relieve the feeling of fullness in them. Her Doberman seems to be interested in her breasts as well and when he gets her naked in the bedroom she can’t stop him from having his way with them. She is shocked as he sucks the milk right out of her, but then spreads herself wide for him so that he can have his way with her pussy. 
Excerpt:
I pulled my t-shirt drawer open and reached in to grab the one on the top of the pile when I heard a deep growl come from Max&#39;s throat. He took a step toward me and growled a second time and I looked over at him in complete shock. He had never growled at me before.
&quot;What on earth is wrong with you?&quot;
I turned back to the dresser and pulled the t-shirt out of the drawer and Max growled again, stepping closer to me like he was giving me some kind of warning.
“What?!”
I stood there and stared at him for a moment and he seemed to calm down, so I lifted the t-shirt up over my head. But before I could pull it on, Max jumped up and pushed me backward so that I landed on the bed. I had the t-shirt over my head and my hands caught in the arm holes and I struggled to get it off so that I could see.
&quot;What the hell are you doing, Max?&quot;
I finally got the shirt off my head in time to see Max get onto the bed and jump on top of me. He growled again as he straddled my body but then became very still. I felt goosebumps spread across my body as I looked into his eyes. They were suddenly so deep and dark and hypnotic and I couldn’t look away. Or maybe they had always been that way and I was just noticing now. The deep swirls of color set deep into the black abyss seemed to come toward me as I lay there, helplessly pinned under him.
As I stared into Max&#39;s eyes, strange things started to happen inside me. My breasts felt like they were growing even larger as I lay there. It felt almost as if they were being inflated like two party balloons. My nipples were now so sensitive that I screamed when Max bent down and licked one.
&quot;Max, what are you doing?&quot;
His tongue lapped both breasts in smaller and smaller circles as his eyes looked deep into mine. Then he put his mouth around one of the rock hard nipples and started to suck. I could feel his little dog teeth clamping down around the incredibly sensitive nub, which sent shockwaves through my body. A part of me wanted to throw him off of me. It wanted to jump up and run away from the pain and the humiliation of having my dog suck on my breasts, but I couldn&#39;t move.
The only thing that I could move were my legs. And the only thing I could do was spread them wide. It was as if a voice inside me was telling me what to do. And that voice seemed to have total control over me. It told me how good I would feel if I opened up my legs and arched my back. It told me that what was going on was totally natural. That there was nothing at all wrong with having Max suck the milk out of my breasts. " />
