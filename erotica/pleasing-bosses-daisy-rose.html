      <meta name="description" content="Marie is in a lot of trouble when her lover finds her in the arms of black man, wearing nothing except her shame. She is punished and humiliated in more ways than one as the powerful alpha male shows her just who&amp;#39;s in charge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pain and pleasure intertwine as she surrenders to lovers who bring her to her knees and enthralls her completely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hey, what&amp;#39;re you doing?&amp;quot; Steve asked, jolted out of his stunned silence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Punishing my woman,&amp;quot; Tanner growled, his voice sending vibrations down my spine. &amp;quot;Either you stay and watch or get out.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All the air left my lungs when he threw me onto the bed, standing between my parted legs, his hands gripping my thighs to keep them open. I felt my entire body flushed red with shame.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Tanner. I, I-&amp;quot; I swallowed. Why did he sudden seem so close... and why was I shaking even though it was starting to get hot in here? Tensing slightly, I dared to peek up at him from under my lashes and was stunned to see that there was not just anger in his gaze, there was lust and desire as well, so thick and heavy that I could almost taste it on my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He released my leg and his knuckle lightly grazed across my collar bone, his touch sucking the air right out of me. A trembling shiver ran through me as his touch teased up my slender neck, then slipped under my jaw and tugged me closer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wasn&amp;#39;t sure exactly what he had in mind. He called it punishment, but his touches were light and there wasn&amp;#39;t the look on his face, the one that he had before he punished me in the past. He&amp;#39;d been rough with me before, but never in anger. It was one of his rules. I had a safe word for if he went too far and I&amp;#39;d never had to use it before.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You what?&amp;quot; he asked, his hushed voice pulling me in like a magnet. I found myself leaning closer and closer, propping myself up with my arms, unable to form a proper thought.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The backs of his fingers brushed my hair aside.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A chill that was at once both hot and cold ran down my spine under his stern gaze and I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if the stiffening of my nipples was the effect of his eyes or his soft touches. I bit my bottom lip as his hands moved over my naked body, pulling the blouse through my arms to be rid of that last piece of clothing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Tanner,&amp;quot; I breathed, unsure of what was going through his brain. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, I didn&amp;#39;t- I didn&amp;#39;t mean to-&amp;quot; I stopped talking. It wasn&amp;#39;t as if that would explain why I was naked with the black man, why I was practically begging for him to cum inside me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Next time, I want to watch,&amp;quot; he said simply.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I looked up from beneath my lashes to stare at him in shock. His piercing eyes stared back at me, unflinching. He had never been one to back down from a fight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s your safe word?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I paled when I realized I had forgotten it. How long had it been since he asked me to repeat his safe word to him? Weeks? Months?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s your safe word?&amp;quot; he repeated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t remember,&amp;quot; I admitted. &amp;quot;I- I- Can you give me a new one?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What if I didn&amp;#39;t? What if I wouldn&amp;#39;t give you another safe word? What if we played without one?&amp;quot;" />
