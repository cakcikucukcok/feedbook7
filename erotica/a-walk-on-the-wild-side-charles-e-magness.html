  <title>A Walk On The Wild Side - Charles E. Magness</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Charlie and Mindy had been more than best friends their entire lives. But close as they were, something unexpected was about to happen when they enjoyed a week-long camping trip in the rugged Wyoming mountains&amp;hellip;something that was about to change their entire lives! They were about to discover that their special bond was both deeper and closer than they had ever anticipated!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
She was short, so I knelt in front of her, with my back toward her, for her to check my scalp and ears. Then she knelt behind me, straddling my lower legs. The creamy skin of her inner legs and lower thighs brushed against my legs while she checked me as I had just checked her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;None on you, either.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I turned around; we faced each other, on our knees, both completely naked. She looked down, then smiled..." />
