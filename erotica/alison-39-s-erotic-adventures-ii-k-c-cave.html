~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
“Allie. Don’t do it,” Tommy pleaded, shifting the phone to his other shoulder. “Please. You could get hurt.”
“I’ve been to that bar before. Fred knows me. You’re always so dramatic.”
“Fred’s the bartender. He can’t help you in the parking lot when a half-dozen sex-crazed, laid-off crane jockeys throw you down on the parking lot and start taking turns,” Tommy said. “At the very least, you’ll be picking gravel out of your formerly beautiful backside for the next week.”
“Tommy, Moriah was a cop. She can handle tough situations. Until she gets there from the airport, I’ll stick close to Fred.”
“Does she carry?”
“Of course not.”
“Then what’s she going to do when you two are manhandled into that back room by a crowd of beer-infused rednecks? They might just gangbang both of you on the bar. Worse has happened in that place. Shootings, knifings.”
“Don’t be hysterical.”
Tommy sighed. “Okay, tell you what. I’ll rearrange my schedule. You’ll get there, what, at nine? I’m entertaining three German auto execs, suits, about a very big deal. I’ll take them to Ric’s. They thrive on that kind of shit…slumming around low-brow, knuckle-draggers in sleazy shitholes. They’re Euro-trash snobs who like nothing better than looking down their noses at dumb Americans. I’ve got two hookers lined up for them…real floozies, too, teased hair, gum-snapping whores. Yeah, that’ll work. An evening of cultural hypocrisy topped off by a group bang on that busted pool table.”
“Don’t change your plans for me,” Alison sniffed.
“I won’t interfere with your evening of lesbian bliss. You won’t even know I’m there. I’ll just get some peace of mind.”
“Hey, I got plans for that pool table. Anyway, how are you going to watch over me? Won’t you be banging the whores, too?”
“Nope. I’ve got to babysit the one broad in the group, a suit from Stuttgart. Icy bitch, and that’s saying a lot for a female German auto executive. I’ll be able to keep an eye on you while the male Krauts take their revenge for Dresden in the back room. When’s your girlfriend supposed to get there?”
“Her flight gets in around eight. With baggage and stuff, maybe nine-thirty.”
“From where?”
“Milwaukee.”
“That means she’s got to go through O’Hare. This time of year there’s a good chance the flight will be late. We won’t tie up the pool table for long. A couple quickies is all I’m paying for.”
“You’re overwrought, but I like it when you worry about me. Reminds me of high school.”
“Dammit, Alison, do you have any idea what could’ve happened two years ago if I wasn’t there for that gangbang of yours? You might’ve been torn to pieces, found naked and dead on the side of the road the next morning with a broken beer bottle up your snatch.”
“I owe you one.”
“It might be two after Friday.”
“You’ll buy me a drink, won’t you? Before Moriah gets there?”
“Yeah, sure, I’ll push my way through the crowd of horn dogs sniffing at you and say hi.”
