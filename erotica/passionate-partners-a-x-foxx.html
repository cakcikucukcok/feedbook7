  <title>Passionate Partners - A.X. Foxx</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everyone tells Freya that it&amp;#39;s impossible, that even the most talented, beautiful, and perfect women are not hired by the company, let alone someone as unimpressive as her. The man in charge, Raphael Hunter, may be wildly successful, but he is also controlling, ill-tempered, and stubborn to a fault. He only hires the best, and he only hires men.&lt;br /&gt;
Yet Freya Fanning believes she can be successful because she has an advantage nobody else knows about:&lt;br /&gt;
Raphael is a Master. Her Master. And she isn&amp;#39;t there to work. She&amp;rsquo;s there to be dominated.&lt;br /&gt;
Passionate Partners is a standalone short story that is filled with dominating alpha males and a single submissive young woman in public.&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
I jumped when I felt his grip on my arm. He leaned in close, so close that his lips were on my ears. When he breathed out, the second hand smoke clouded my sight and filled my lungs with warmth. The tendrils of smoke wrapped around me and I caught a hint of cocoa in the smoke that left a sweet after-taste in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;
He was too close to me. I had to fight the urge to run away, which wasn&amp;#39;t unusual for me. He was capable of making me feel safer and more content than anyone in the world, but he was also capable of inciting fear.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;re you doing here, Freya?&amp;quot; he growled, his voice vibrating from the bones in my jaw down the base of my spine. There was a shuddering in my loins that made it suddenly hard to breath. His exhaled air was warm but his grip on my arm was almost painful.&lt;br /&gt;
I fought back the panic in my heart, thumping hard enough for him to fell the pulsing in my veins.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I- I applied for the job,&amp;quot; I stammered, suddenly unsure of myself.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I know what you&amp;#39;re thinking,&amp;quot; he said, leaning back only enough to take another puff of whatever it was he was smoking.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What am I thinking?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You think the only reason you made it this far is because I wanted you,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Am I wrong?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
I whirled around to face him, certain that he was lying but the steady expression on his face said otherwise. &amp;quot;I thought-&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You thought I saw your name in the list and used my power to keep you in the running,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; I said, absolutely certain that the only reason I was even there was because he wanted me there.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re wrong,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I am?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Completely,&amp;quot; his grip on my arm tightened painfully. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re here because you&amp;#39;re better than the fake bitches with their high heels and thick makeup,&amp;quot; he hissed into my ear.&lt;br /&gt;
He pulled back and took a long drag of smoke, then blew it out the window. I watched as the smoke dissipated into nothing. &amp;quot;Even a fool can see that they&amp;#39;re not half the woman you are. You&amp;#39;re here because you&amp;#39;re willing to work hard for what you want. Did you see the girl in the black dress?&amp;quot; he asked.&lt;br /&gt;
I frowned, then nodded. She had thick blonde hair tied in a neat bun and seemed to have handed the secretary his number before leaving.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;She graduated two years ago top of her class, but hasn&amp;#39;t gotten a single job since.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Impossible,&amp;quot; I said immediately. It was hard to believe someone like her would have a problem getting a job anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Because she believed they were all beneath her,&amp;quot; he snarled. &amp;quot;She tried to take her clothes off earlier,&amp;quot; he laughed, then snubbed the cigarette on the glass window pan and tossed the still sizzling butt into the bin.&lt;br /&gt;
There was a tightness in my chest that came from jealousy. I knew I shouldn&amp;#39;t feel jealous. He wasn&amp;#39;t mine to keep.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;She was wearing expensive underwear, but it wasn&amp;#39;t enough to hide the fact that her breasts were fake,&amp;quot; he sneered unkindly.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I thought I was here because you wanted to keep my close,&amp;quot; I mumbled, face burning red with shame. It felt ridiculous now, to believe that he would go as far as to hire me to his job so he could-&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Now that you&amp;#39;re here, that&amp;#39;s the only thing I can think about,&amp;quot; he said so abruptly I felt my face burning even more." />
