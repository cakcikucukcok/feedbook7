&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;How do I know you won&amp;#39;t get jealous? Maybe I should&amp;nbsp; you know, take a bull&amp;#39; here. I mean, you know, play with a black bull but, like, not for real.&amp;quot; She giggled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was throbbing in her hand. &amp;quot;I think I&amp;#39;ve handled my jealousy pretty well.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, you handled an old man and a rich guy, can you handle a big black bull?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh god,&amp;quot; I pulled her hand off me before I exploded. &amp;quot;In fairness, there was a woman in there, too.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It got you close, didn&amp;#39;t it?&amp;quot; Brittany straddled my lap, her mouth close to my ear. &amp;quot;I have a secret.&amp;quot; I could feel her lips just touching my ear, along with the brush of her breath when she pronounced s.&amp;#39; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been on a dating site looking for a bull, and I think I found one.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My heart was pounding so hard I was sure Brittany would be able to hear. &amp;quot;Brittany?&amp;quot; It was all I could get out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I probably won&amp;#39;t have sex with him, but I&amp;#39;m curious.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The next Friday I was in our car driving to pick up Tyrone and bring him back to our apartment. He would go upstairs, and I&amp;#39;d stay with the car. When they were done doing, whatever it was, I would drive Tyrone back to his home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The area he lived in was somewhere between respectable and ghetto. It would go one way or another in the next few years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I parked the car between a jacked-up Chevrolet from the 1960s and a newer luxury car. Tyrone himself was a good-looking, Ali-type guy. Except his jeans exposed the boxers he wore, and the baseball cap on his head was turned sideways. He looked arrogant, and he walked with a swagger, as if his equipment was so big, he couldn&amp;#39;t move normally.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I understand your wife wants to play with a bull tonight,&amp;quot; I might have been wrong about him. He had a big smile and an easy way. He didn&amp;#39;t appear to be taking this too seriously. &amp;quot;Well, here I am, your wife&amp;#39;s bull. Riiight, that&amp;#39;s what I do, I take care of white women.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He laughed so hard I had to join in. &amp;quot;Riiight,&amp;quot; I added.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I couldn&amp;#39;t help looking at him in the rearview mirror. He had sprawled in the seat, seeming to take up the entire car. When he caught me looking, he grinned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re the husband.&amp;quot; It wasn&amp;#39;t a question.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I nodded, without saying a word.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t you worry, Tyrone take care your woman,&amp;quot; he tried to get into character but ended up laughing again. I liked him, if Brittany was going to let a black man between her legs, this was the black man she&amp;#39;d want.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Still, I felt humiliated, despite his good humor. After all, I had been told to pick up a man to service my wife, and I was doing it. What did he really think of me? As I drove the bull to our apartment, I touched myself through my pants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was torture sitting in the car waiting for Tyrone to return. He seemed to be gone for a very long time. I wondered if I could sneak in the front door of our apartment before giving up the plan as unworkable. I understood my wife&amp;#39;s sudden interest in black guys and maybe they were actually up there doing it. Would Brittany do that to me?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hours passed before Tyrone returned. After he was in the backseat, he gave me a huge smile and put on a pair of dark sunglasses. &amp;quot;Man, that wife of yours is something!&amp;quot;" />
