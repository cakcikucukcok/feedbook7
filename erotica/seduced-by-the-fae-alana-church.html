  <title>Seduced by the Fae - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rory Harper led a happy life. A brilliant programmer, she had no need for sex or relationships. But one crazy night, she was abducted and whisked across the border into Faerie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now she learns she is the lost Queen of Summer. Her body transformed into a gorgeous woman, will she be able to leash her growing desires before it is too late? She is now Aurora, and she is being &amp;quot;Seduced by the Fae!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aurora looked at her image, and gasped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That is not me. It&amp;#39;s a trick. It can&amp;#39;t be true.&lt;/i&gt; She raised a hand to her face in disbelief, her eyes widening as her reflection did the same.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I&amp;#39;m...beautiful.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Indeed, calling her beautiful seemed as redundant as calling Mount Everest &amp;quot;big&amp;quot; or the Grand Canyon &amp;quot;Man, really deep, yo.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her hair...she reached up. Formerly a limp, mousy brown, now it burst forth from her scalp in reddish-gold abundance, curling around her face before falling in waves over her shoulders and down her back. Her mouth was generous and sensual, with full, pouting lips drawn up in a coquettish bow. The crooked place in her nose was gone. Her cheeks were no longer hollow and pale, but full, with high, arching cheekbones that drew the eye, and her eyebrows curled in delicate wings, giving her a winsome look.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And that was only the smallest change.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her legs were longer. Much longer. She could see the way the cuffs of her beige, no-nonsense slacks now stopped a good three inches above her ankles. And the slacks themselves were uncomfortably tight around her legs, which were noticeably fuller, her thighs straining at the cheap polyester. She shifted, trying to ease the too-tight fit, and to her mortification, her pants ripped, exposing a long glimpse of golden-tan skin. And that was not all. Before, her hips had been so boyish that she was forced to buy men&amp;#39;s clothes in an effort to disguise just how bony her hips and rear were. But now the waist of her slacks was almost painfully snug, the curves of her hips pushing at the tight-stretched fabric in an effort to escape.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And still there was more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With her new height, her blouse had pulled out of her waistband of her slacks. She trailed her fingers across the warm, glowing skin of her stomach, somehow soft and muscular at the same time. And even higher up...she swallowed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It couldn&amp;#39;t be real. &lt;i&gt;They&lt;/i&gt; couldn&amp;#39;t be real." />
