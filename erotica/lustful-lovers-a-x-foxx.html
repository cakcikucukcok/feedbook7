  <title>Lustful Lovers - A.X. Foxx</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Shy and reserved Rosie has a different side to her that nobody knows about, and she wants to keep it that way. Her blind date has a different idea altogether.&lt;br /&gt;
Taylor knows her secrets, and isn&amp;#39;t afraid to push her limits and devastate her control over her mind and body.

Will there be a happy ending to her love affair, or will her life be ruined by the humiliation?&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s my date,&amp;quot; James said, trying to get away from the man&amp;#39;s grasp to no avail. The stranger kept him at arm&amp;#39;s length, muscles bulging impressively. His stance was unchanged, as if James&amp;#39; efforts to get away didn&amp;#39;t bother him in the least.&lt;br /&gt;
My savior was a large black man who looked like he could knock James out with just a single punch if he wanted to. James must&amp;#39;ve seen that, too, since he quickly relented and stopped struggling.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;She wasn&amp;#39;t my type anyways,&amp;quot; he said, shrugging off the man&amp;#39;s hands and turning around. It was a little disappointing that he wasn&amp;#39;t going to fight for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Thank you,&amp;quot; I said, turning to my savior with a grateful smile.&lt;br /&gt;
He didn&amp;#39;t crack a grin and continued to stare at me with intense eyes that promised a world unknown to me. His eyes roamed down my half naked body and face burning red with shame. There was something inexplicably sexy about my knight in shining armor. He looked like a lion being presented with fresh meat.&lt;br /&gt;
I was still debating whether I should be running away from the mysterious man when he grabbed my wrist and pushed me against the wall.&lt;br /&gt;
All the air left my lungs. I really went out of the frying pan into the fire this time.&lt;br /&gt;
His hands were warm against my skin as he wrapped his fingers around my neck.&lt;br /&gt;
I flinched from his touch and tried to get away, but his grasp was too tight. My lips quivered when I spoke again, &amp;quot;Let go.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
His breath burned my ear as he leaned in close to press his cheek to my face. He closed his eyes and spoke with a deepness that vibrated through my bones.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I know your secret,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t even know my name,&amp;quot; I responded.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Rosie,&amp;quot; he drew out my name like a caress. It rumbled from my ears straight down my core.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know what you&amp;#39;re talking about,&amp;quot; I whispered, but there was a tightness in my loins that betrayed my fear. My heartbeat went into overdrive. My mind was going a million miles a minute. He couldn&amp;#39;t know. Nobody knows. I was certain that I had been careful. Had I been careless? What did he see? What does he know?&lt;br /&gt;
His eyes searched my weak gaze and he whispered gently, &amp;quot;I know what you do in the dark.&amp;quot;" />
