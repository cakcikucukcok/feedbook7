  <title>Jungle Fever - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="His lean muscles rippled as he moved towards me, danger and masculinity oozing from him. There was a fire in his eyes that was mesmerizing.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t belong here,&amp;quot; he growled, closing in, our breaths so close that I could smell the sweat on his body.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;His teeth bit into my neck gently, just enough pressure to prove a point, sucking in to leave a mark on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;I knew when I was in trouble when I started moaning.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t have his shirt on. There were scratches on his skin, as if he attempted to get off the trail and then decided against it when his shirt was ripped apart. My eyes traveled the length of his body and I had to swallow the sigh hovering on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Trent, it&amp;#39;s so good to see you. We need to get out of the jungle. There&amp;#39;s-&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;I never got to finish my sentence as he started talking.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;His eyes turned dark as he stared at me, unblinking. Moving a step closer, he said in barely a whisper, &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s a sweet little thing like you doing alone in the big, bad jungle?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;His voice was a deep growl that frightened me. He was nothing like the man I have had a crush on for years. Trent has always been safe, reliable, trustworthy. He was the kind of man you&amp;#39;d run to when the rest of the world failed you. He was only thirty five, but had the worldly wisdom that made him knowledgeable about almost everything.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;But right that instant, he felt dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;He was dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Do you want to get hurt? There&amp;#39;re wild animals in here&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;I backed away, certain that this stranger was more dangerous than any animal in the jungle. His lean muscles rippled as he moved towards me, danger and masculinity oozing from him. There was a fire in his eyes that scared and confused me.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t belong here,&amp;quot; he growled, closing in on me, our breaths so close that I could smell the sweat on his body. I smelled his musky, masculine scent and went weak at the knees. When he stepped closer towards me, his breath tickled the side of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t belong here either,&amp;quot; I countered as we breathed each other&amp;#39;s air, inhaling as he exhaled. The tension in the air was palpable, made even worse by what I had seen just minutes earlier. My breathing almost stopped as I followed the soft fullness of his lips, wondering how he tasted." />
