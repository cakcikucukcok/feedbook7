  <title>Got MILF? - Laura Lovecraft, Alana Church, Jessie Foxx</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For the first time in one hot volume, bestselling erotica authors Jessie Foxx, Alana Church, and Laura Lovecraft combine their talents to bring you &amp;ldquo;Got MILF?&amp;rdquo; a sizzling trio of stories about MILFs who are out-of-this-world sexy, sultry, and gorgeous. Lose yourself in steamy desire as three lucky young men get their wildest dreams fulfilled!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt from &amp;ldquo;Driven MILF-Crazy&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So,&amp;rdquo; Estella began. &amp;ldquo;Do you want to step out of the car and take care of it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
I was suddenly overcome with boldness. I mean, she could see my erection; if I was going to be upfront about what I wanted, there was no better time to do it.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Not really.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
I watched her eyes widen as I unzipped my jeans.&lt;br /&gt;
She raised a hand to her mouth, covering a smile. I didn&amp;rsquo;t care if it was from embarrassment; that moment sitting there, exposing myself to this gorgeous MILF, was the most unreal, erotic moment of my life. The blood pounded in my ears, and I swear I could hear my heart beating in my chest. It&amp;rsquo;s a good thing I had nothing to say, because my mouth was so dry I could not utter a single word.&lt;br /&gt;
When Estella finally removed her hand from her face, she was still smiling and her tanned face had gone a shade of red.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Wow. Eduardo I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting&amp;hellip;that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
I swallowed, trying to bring enough moisture to my mouth to say those two crucial words. &amp;ldquo;Wanna help?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt from &amp;ldquo;The Snow Maid&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
She stepped into his arms. She was trembling. With fear or desire, he couldn&amp;#39;t tell. He put his arms around her for comfort and held her, astonished as always to find how small she was. Her breasts were firm against his chest. She spoke softly, cool breath raising goosebumps on his chest.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I forgot what it was like. My creators, bless and damn them, couldn&amp;#39;t imagine a young woman who wasn&amp;#39;t also governed by lust. So the Snow Maid is like a mare who is perpetually in heat. The maid who is also a wanton. Do you understand?&amp;rdquo; she asked, pulling away to look up at his face. For the first time in his memory, her pale face was flushed.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I have no choice in the matter. Damn them all, I don&amp;#39;t really want a choice. Not when she is upon me and you are here. The Snow Maid wants a man. I want a man. I need a man. I want you. I need you, Bill Carter. Thank the High One he brought you to me.&amp;rdquo; She raised herself on her toes, cold lips brushing his.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Make love to me, please?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Without words, Bill took her hands in his and brought them to his lips. Hand in hand, they walked out of the kitchen, and Polina led him to the one place in the house he had never gone.&lt;br /&gt;
Her bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt from &amp;ldquo;After School Special&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Why should a young man feel sorry for looking at an attractive woman?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t?&amp;rdquo; I put my hands out.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Nope,&amp;rdquo; she answered. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m flattered that you look.&amp;rdquo; She gave me a nasty little smirk. &amp;ldquo;I know you do, I know all the boys do, and I love it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I do. I mean, after all&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Grabbing the top of her shirt, she pulled it down to expose more of her cleavage. &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t that what I am: an effing tease?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I was just, um&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; I stopped when she placed her finger to my lips.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;See, that&amp;rsquo;s the problem. Looking is fine, fantasizing is fine, but saying crude nasty things about me is where you were wrong today.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, Miss Ross,&amp;rdquo; I said more firmly this time. &amp;ldquo;I know I was wrong, but could you maybe not tell&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;" />
