  <title>Seeded by Daddy in the Park - Trisha Treat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&amp;#39;s a hot summer day and Daddy wants me to go on a walk in the park with him. There is nothing else to do, so I agree. We decide to play a make-believe game together, even though I am 18 and way too old for such nonesense. Daddy and I always have fun playing games, so who cares if I am too old? Once we start down a private forested trail that we find in the park, our game gets a little too sexy for a Daddy and his daughter. By the end of the game, I am riding Daddy on a park bench, and we are having the best summer afternoon ever!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
My heart rate sped up. What Daddy and I were doing out here on the deserted forest trail seemed a bit naughty. What if somebody saw us kissing like this?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The thought of somebody seeing us made me excited in a way that I had never been before, and I wrapped my arms around daddy&amp;#39;s neck and kissed him back, sticking out my small, soft tongue into his mouth. The stubble on his beard rubbed against my chin as I opened my mouth for him and tasted Daddy&amp;#39;s tongue.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Daddy let out a low growl, and whatever was in his pocket brushed my thigh again.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Suddenly, I realized that whatever was touching my leg wasn&amp;#39;t an object in his pocket at all. The realization hit me all at once, and I couldn&amp;#39;t believe I had never known this before.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Daddy was turned on by me! He made that stupid rule about kissing in the woods so that he could kiss me!" />
