  <title>The Possession of Tyra Dove - Lorenzo Marks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Celebrated feminist and investigative journalist, Tyra Dove, is asked by a friend to look into the sudden disappearance of her younger sister. Based upon the research of her assistant Laurie Bass, Tyra is led to the isolated hilltop village of Foley. Too late, Tyra discovers that she has walked into a trap set by her sexually depraved newspaper colleague, Alex Mundy, and she becomes the latest captive in a nightmare world of female subjugation. Striking a deal with the village&#39;s leader, a self-proclaimed occultist named Valentine Vang, Alex also lures the naïve Laurie to Foley, where Vang uses his mysterious hypnotic potions to transform her into an illiterate, sex-crazed neurotic, and then subjects Tyra to some degrading mental and physical alterations of her own. Laurie is then sent to live with a lecherous old man in the village, and Tyra becomes the slave of  a sadistic, disciplinarian farmer. Corporal punishment, humiliation, and systematic brainwashing, are all meted out with cruel regularity as their lives degenerate into a daily routine of hard labor, demeaning punishment, and perverted sexual service. To her dismay, Laurie finds herself  perpetually unable to curb her carnal urges, and Tyra suffers further torment when Vang programs her to become sexually addicted to Alex. With no outside help on the way, both women soon come to realize that if they don&#39;t regain control of their own minds they will be trapped forever. But with such an intricate web of phobias and addictions implanted in their heads, it is hard enough to endure the daily indignities heaped upon them, let alone formulate a plan of escape!" />
