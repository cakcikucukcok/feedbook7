&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s going on, Jacob?&amp;quot; Dave asked from the front of the car. &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s so urgent you would dump your father-in-law?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just then, Jacob&amp;#39;s phone buzzed again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Emily]the strippers are here, you won&amp;#39;t believe, please join me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Presidential Suite.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe sit in the corner LOL&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was it, that was the entire message. What did maybe sit in the corner&amp;#39; mean? Was Emily going to let one of the strippers have his way with her, at her own bachelorette party?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We gotta hurry guys,&amp;quot; Jacob said from the back seat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dave pulled into a parking spot in front of an all-night liquor store. &amp;quot;First, you have to tell us what&amp;#39;s happening.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both Chris and Dave were staring at him waiting for an answer. &amp;quot;Drive while I tell you, I&amp;#39;ll tell you everything, but we&amp;#39;ve got to move, please.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The two looked at each other, and Dave put the car in gear to start back toward the hotel. Jacob told the story as they drove, causing Dave to drive into the parking lot much too fast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After charging through the lobby, and past the gaming tables, Jacob had just made it to the elevator with the two close behind him, when they heard Dave&amp;#39;s name being yelled. Jacob recognize the voice of Dave&amp;#39;s mother, and stepped quickly inside the open car and out of sight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The door to the Presidential Suite was opened by a topless woman with the word &amp;quot;slut&amp;quot; written across her chest. &amp;quot;Another one is here,&amp;quot; she yelled to the room in general leaving the door open for Jacob.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It looked like a drunken orgy. Three women were fighting over Marcus who was now laying on the floor kissing one, while two worked on his belt and zipper.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jacob had to step around two bridesmaids that he knew were married to men. They were in a sixty-nine position; one was groaning and having a hard time keeping her tongue on the woman in front of her. He wanted to watch as they moaned, their heads between each other&amp;#39;s thighs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Instead, he slipped into the bedroom, leaving the door slightly ajar, and sat in a chair near the foot of the bed. His bride-to-be was naked, on her hands and knees, her legs spread wide, her sex wet and swollen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was kissing Dean who was on his back while another man, Michael, stood against the opposite wall watching. It was only when the couple on the bed moved, that Jacob was able to see Samantha on her knees with Michael in her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The sight of another man in an intimate kiss with his fiance was causing Jacob to thicken, at the same time stabbing him in the heart as a delicious betrayal. He opened his pants so he could easily touch himself. He briefly wondered how Dean had gotten in, the last time he&amp;#39;d seen him had been at the country club.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dean was an impressive sight, such a huge man, the muscles on his forearm and biceps bulged. His thighs were massive, cords of muscles stood out as Emily bent over him. He looked far too big for her to take.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You want to suck that, don&amp;#39;t you?&amp;quot; Dean asked her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, please,&amp;quot; Emily croaked." />
