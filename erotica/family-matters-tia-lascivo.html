&lt;br /&gt;
She&amp;#39;d been sitting on the stairs when I walked into the house. Startled because I hadn&amp;#39;t expected to see her there, I&amp;#39;d blurted out, &amp;quot;Jeez, you scared me,&amp;quot; pausing before adding, &amp;quot;How come you&amp;#39;re sat there?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&amp;#39;s when she&amp;#39;d said it. I&amp;#39;d closed the front door and dropped my sports-bag onto the floor, car keys going into the small bowl on top of the wooden cabinet. It was when I glanced up towards the first-floor landing I&amp;#39;d seen her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After I&amp;#39;d asked the question, she&amp;#39;d sucked in air and blown it all out in a long, exasperated sigh. &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s away again. Working,&amp;quot; she spat, derision in her tone and expression. &amp;quot;That girl&amp;#39;s with him, too.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&amp;#39;d been tension for weeks. I&amp;#39;d felt it around the house, noticed the shift in my parents&amp;#39; demeanour and the way they were around each other. They were behaving in a strange way. Brittle and formal. Two dogs sniffing one another as they sussed out if there was any dispute or a need to fight. For my part I&amp;#39;d largely ignored it. It had nothing to do with me. I was nineteen. I had my life going on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Out of some innate loyalty to my dad, I shrugged and said, &amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s his assistant, mum. She&amp;#39;s gonna go away with him. It&amp;#39;s just work.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She scoffed at that, rolling her eyes. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve seen his emails,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;He thinks he&amp;#39;s deleting them from his account but doesn&amp;#39;t realise they stay in the trash folder for a few days.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt anxiety clutch at my guts as I said, &amp;quot;You check his email?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She nodded, shrugging. &amp;quot;Yes. It&amp;#39;s proof.&amp;quot;" />
