  <title>Full Circle - Charles E. Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;There is a known fact on the streets: What goes around - comes around. When you do wrong to others it will come back to you in a &lt;I&gt;full circle&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Raheem&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; is not only handsome, but sexy, vicious and a freak of nature, and he only has one thing on his mind and that is using women to get what he wants. He could never be completely satisfied sexually with just one woman. He is a true player and lives by the motto; don&#39;t hate the player - just hate the game.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Mya&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; is not only beautiful and sexy, but very intelligent, loyal and committed to family values. She is a loving and passionate mother. She has a difficult time dealing with people with hidden agendas so she is always suspicious of ones motives. If you cross her you will have a whole new person to deal with. Her motto is; reap what you sow.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Sabrina&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; is beautiful and has a body to die for but sometimes that just not enough. She is looking for a loving and trusting relationship. Her life has been through the rime, but before she can find what she is truly looking for she has to come clean about some things she left in the past. Her motto is; fool me once shame on you - fool me twice and shame on me.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;I&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Full Circle&lt;/I&gt; is a novel that will keep you at the edge of your seat with lots of sexual tension, humor, betrayal, suspense, and revenge.&lt;/P&gt;
