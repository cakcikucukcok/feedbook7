&lt;br /&gt;
Ella pushed through the thorny thickets. Sweat trickled from her brow, down her cheek and was wiped away with a quick brush of her hand. Her heart pounded like a loud Zulu war drum vibrating over the African Savannah.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There! She froze when she saw the mighty beast. The most masculine of all animals materialized out of nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ella desired this beast. Not for a trophy, nor a pic but to mate with him and to carry his kittens. Her ovaries ached with longing at the mere thought of mating with a magnificent animal such as this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With trembling hands she opened the vial and gulped the too sweet liquid down her throat. Ella had found it on the Dark Web and it promised to make her fertile and be able to carry any animal she selected.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sending a prayer to the wind that it would work and he would sire his kittens in her womb, she revealed herself to him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The large, majestic lion halted in his tracks, sniffing the hot air. His tail twitched back and forth as if confused. He stood there, thinking, then after a few moments he whirled around and strode toward her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Strange emotions rushed through her as the potion began to work its magic. All she could concentrate on was fucking this large black-maned lion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She froze when he pushed through the thickets and stopped dead, staring at her. Confusion danced in his amber eyes when he noticed her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Where was the lioness? His eyes seemed to ask.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I am, Big Boy.&amp;quot; She slowly danced as she removed her clothes, with him focused on her.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Slowly he padded up to her like a large house cat. He shoved his nose in her lady parts and inhaled her rich lioness heat perfume.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He gave a deep growl. She shivered as she spread her legs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ella grew braver as she ran her fingers through his thick black mane. It reminded her of human hair and was a bit tangled. What did she expect, him go to the spa every day?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In his excitement, he nearly knocked her over, rubbing his massive head against her. She knelt before him like he was a king. Big Boy sniffed her face as she peppered his large muzzle with searing virgin kisses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He lapped her face with his sandpaper-like tongue. She kissed him on his lips as her tongue explored his cavernous mouth, thrilled to be doing this to a wild lion. It was so forbidden!" />
