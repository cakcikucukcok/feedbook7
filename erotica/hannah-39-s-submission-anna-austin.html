  <title>Hannah&#39;s Submission - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hannah thinks that she is oh-so clever. Who would suspect a pretty and innocent young woman like her of being a poacher, stealing from the Duke of Almsbury&amp;#39;s land?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She is not so clever now. Caught red-handed by the Duke and his gamekeepers, she must face her punishment. Hannah soon finds herself entering a world of lust, pain and desire from which there is no escape...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was a dangerous game to play. I knew the risks. Or at least I thought I did. But when my punishment came, it took me by surprise.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The game itself was simple, and driven by that all too human desire&amp;nbsp; profit. The logic was simple. Pheasants, freshly caught and in good condition, sold at Almsbury market for sixpence. My family and I did not own any pheasants, or any land on which on which pheasants lived. But just a mile from our village was the estate of the Duke of Almsbury. And he had pheasants in abundance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For a clever, enterprising and someone unscrupulous young girl like me, the logic was simple. The Duke would never notice one or two pheasants missing from his lands. But I would certainly notice the extra money jingling in my pocket. And if that meant that I had to commit theft? Well, it&amp;#39;s only a crime if someone finds out." />
