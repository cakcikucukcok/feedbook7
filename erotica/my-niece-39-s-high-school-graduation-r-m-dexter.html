  <title>My Niece&#39;s High School Graduation - R.m. Dexter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
In this incestuous erotic tale of barely legal sex, a well-hung uncle explores forbidden boundaries with his hot but na&amp;iuml;ve niece. When this curious school girl starts asking questions on graduation night, she finds her uncle has the sexual answers she craves most. Together the two of them learn everything there is to know, while combining their taboo fantasies in a night of lust filled sex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
Vaseline-Baby Fresh Scent. For jerking off, this stuff was like American Express to me. &amp;ldquo;DON&amp;rsquo;T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT!&amp;rdquo; I was sitting in front of my computer reading some adult stories on the web, and just as I opened the jar in front of me to start polishing up my knob, the phone rang.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hello.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hey Jeff, I need you to do me a favor this weekend.&amp;rdquo; It was my older brother David on the line.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s up?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Maria&amp;rsquo;s aunt died yesterday and we&amp;rsquo;ve got to fly out tomorrow morning for the funeral. We&amp;rsquo;ll be gone until Sunday night and I&amp;rsquo;d like you to watch Emma for us.&amp;rdquo; Maria was his wife and I knew her aunt had been sick for a while now. Emma was their teenage daughter. They lived just across town from me, thus the call.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re not taking her with you?&amp;rdquo; I was surprised since as their only child they overprotected this kid and rarely let her out of their sight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;We normally would but it&amp;rsquo;s actually her graduation tomorrow night and she&amp;rsquo;s really been looking forward to it. She hardly knew this aunt anyway so we think she should stay. She&amp;rsquo;s been looking forward to this for weeks now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;She can&amp;rsquo;t stay on her own?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Maria and I still think she&amp;rsquo;s too young to stay by herself.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s my overprotective big brother for you. The kid would probably be fine on her own. &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rsquo;mon Jeff, I need you to do this for us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay, okay. What do I need to do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Great! Thanks. Well, you could pick her up from school at 3:00 and then bring her home here first. Her ceremony starts at 7:00 and then there&amp;rsquo;s a dance afterwards in the school gym. If you could go to the ceremony and take some pictures that would be great. Then just pick her up after the dance. I&amp;rsquo;ll get her to call you on her cell phone.&amp;rdquo; I could tell by the tone of my brother&amp;rsquo;s voice that my agreeing to watch his daughter had taken a load off his mind. They had always sheltered her and were so overprotective of her that she was distinctly lacking in &amp;ldquo;street smarts&amp;rdquo;. She was a great kid, but definitely na&amp;iuml;ve in the ways of the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That sounds pretty easy,&amp;rdquo; I answered. &amp;ldquo;Anything else?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, that should be about it. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the camera and some money so you guys can get some dinner. Feel free to use our room and I know you&amp;rsquo;ll use the pool.&amp;rdquo; My brother and his wife owned their own company and had done very well for themselves. They had a nice big house with a beautifully landscaped secluded yard and a nice big pool.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay. Tell Maria I&amp;rsquo;m sorry about her aunt. So what time will you be back Sunday?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Probably about 6:30. If it&amp;rsquo;s going to be later, I&amp;rsquo;ll call you. Thanks bro&amp;rsquo;. I owe you one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No problem. Have a good time&amp;hellip; or&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; whatever kind of time you can have at a funeral. See you Sunday night.&amp;rdquo;" />
