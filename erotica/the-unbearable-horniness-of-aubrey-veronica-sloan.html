  <title>The Unbearable Horniness Of Aubrey - Veronica Sloan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Aubrey has a problem. The girl needs to get off! Ever since coming home from college she&amp;#39;s felt uncharacteristically horny. She&amp;#39;ll take any man she can get! Unfortunately, her attempt to get laid has ended in disaster. It&amp;#39;s late at night and she&amp;#39;s writhing on the bed, hands between her legs and aching for someone to satisfy her. Is that her father in the doorway? Well...he is a man, isn&amp;#39;t he?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sasha tilted her sunglasses. &amp;quot;Have you been seeing anyone else?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Uh...&amp;quot; How to answer that? I&amp;#39;d seen my father a lot since that night.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sasha grunted. &amp;quot;Oh Gawd! You called Doug!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No!&amp;quot; I laughed. &amp;quot;Oh, honey, no. Doug couldn&amp;#39;t give me what I want.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oooh,&amp;quot; Sasha purred. &amp;quot;So now you know what you want?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh yeah. I just smiled and wiggled my wet hips against hers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Who is he?&amp;quot; she asked. &amp;quot;Someone from school?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shook my head. &amp;quot;He was older.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Was?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve only done it once.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She flashed her white teeth. &amp;quot;But you really liked it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mmmmhmmm.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You should have told me,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;We could have invited him instead of, uh,&amp;quot; she snapped her fingers and looked back at the boys, &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s his name?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; I sighed. &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s married.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Aubrey!&amp;quot; A mixture of pride and disbelief passed over Sasha&amp;#39;s face. It was so intense she lifted herself off the towel, forgetting that she&amp;#39;d taken off her top. A sharp whistle came at us from somewhere down the beach but Sasha reveled in it. The volleyball team erupted in applause.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With a look of unparalleled satisfaction, Sasha laid down beside me. &amp;quot;Okay, seriously. You have to tell me more.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve known him for a while,&amp;quot; I said. I was buzzing from Sasha&amp;#39;s slutty show and got off on telling her a version of the truth. &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s always been around but I never thought he was...into me. Actually, I&amp;#39;m not sure if he is into me, but that night we just...did it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Ugh,&amp;quot; Sasha groaned. &amp;quot;I am so jealous.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I snorted. &amp;quot;You and Charlie are together all the time!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yeah,&amp;quot; she admitted. &amp;quot;And that&amp;#39;s nice. He&amp;#39;s nice. Notice how I keep saying nice?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I noticed.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Married guys are different. Every time they&amp;#39;re with you it&amp;#39;s like the last time, or the first time. They know they&amp;#39;re not supposed to do it, and that it&amp;#39;s just a matter of time before they get caught. So they let themselves be crazy. They give you all the nasty sex they&amp;#39;ve been saving in their heads for years.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I thought of my father. &amp;quot;Yeah...&amp;quot; I said softly." />
