  <title>Taken By The Pack - Kimmy Hicks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a hot, horny woman goes for a morning walk along the river during her fertile time of the month, a pack of stray dogs takes notice. Alone on the river banks, her aching pussy gets the better of her, and she begins to pleasure herself - unleashing her scent to the wind. When the lustful pack of canines catches her heady female scent, they move in on her horny pussy quickly, and before she knows it, she is lonely no more as her needs are filled by the dogs, along with each of her slick orifices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lost in the moment, I closed my eyes as my pussy juiced all over my hands. My eyes shot open, though, when I heard a growl from behind me. Afraid to turn around, but more afraid not to, I glanced behind me to see where the noise came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind me stood the same black dog that I had encountered earlier. Only now, the dog had company. I realized there was a pack of five hounds closing in on me, all looking at me with a primal hunger in their eyes. When I looked harder at the dogs, I realized that they weren&#39;t hungry for meat, though. All of them had massively engorged cocks fully extended and ready for fucking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instinctively, I covered my breasts with my hands, even though I knew that was ridiculous. These were dogs, not men. Dogs aren&#39;t aroused by naked human women - at least that&#39;s what I had always thought before." />
