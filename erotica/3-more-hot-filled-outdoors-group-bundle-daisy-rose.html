~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
My car getting ruined must have messed with some nerves in my brain. I was never one to make risky decisions based on lust, but I was willing to go back with this sexy stranger whom I knew nothing about? I must have gone completely and absolutely insane.
All the breath left my lungs when his eyes blazed at my agreement and he closed the space between us. With one hand, he swiftly unbuttoned the first few buttons on his shirt. With his other, he reached around my waist and pulled me to him.
His lips taste of fine wine.
I wondered how drunk he was and if that fueled his decision to pick up a random woman from a train station.
I stood in his arms, my heart in my throat as he drank the last bit of my restraint from my lips. Then, his hands lifted the hem of my dress and I closed my eyes and stifled a moan.
His eyes were dark with desire when we parted for air and I felt my insides tighten in response to the desperation in his lips as he eagerly kissed me again, swallowing me in the passionate taste of his tongue and lips.
It was dangerous and out of control. &quot;Camera,&quot; I gasped when our lips parted for the second time.
He looked around briefly, then grabbed my arm and pulled me to the side of the track. We disappeared into a little corner where no security cameras could catch what we were doing.
The moment we were out of sight, his hand slipped around the side of my neck and his fingers curled into my hair. He traced my lips with his tongue, then dipped inside for another taste of me. I was lost immediately, eyes fluttering close as I snaked my arms around his waist, appreciating the hard muscles beneath the suit.
He took my face in his hands and rested his forehead to mines as we both fought to catch out breaths. It was surreal. His kisses were intoxicating. I imagined bottling up his kisses for special occasions. Like little puffs of heaven.
I dragged my hands up his back, slipping under his shirt so I could feel bare skin to skin. He shuddered from my touch and I smiled.
&quot;Let&#39;s do it here,&quot; he said.
&quot;Here?&quot; my knees buckled.
