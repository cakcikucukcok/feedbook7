  <title>Genetic Sexual Attraction - Dinkleberry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Genetic Sexual Attraction. What is GSA? Does it differ from Consensual Incest? It’s a hotly debated subject. This novel explores the phenomenon. A son, a mother, a brother, a sister and a daughter share how GSA granted them an intimate love they found with no one else. Speaking with renowned sociologist, Dr. Gavin, they share how GSA allowed them to cross one of society’s strongest taboos.
~~~~~ Excerpt  ~~~~~
“Berry, Dorian, it’s good to see you two. How have you been?” Dr. Gavin welcomed as he led us into his office. I took his offered hand and we warmly shook hands.
“Hello, Doctor Gavin,” Berry drawled in a breathy, sultry southern belle accent and gave him a playful kiss on his cheek.
While I was casually dressed for our visit with the doc, my older sister looked like a skanky vamp. She had blown-out her raven hair into an exotic mane, and her dark eyeliner heightened her blue eyes. She wore a tight, short black leather jacket and underneath wore only a black leather bustier. Below the waist, my sister wore skin-tight, form-fitting black leggings, which seemed to be made of multiple thin layers of lace. The overlapping lace patterns revealed her succulent flesh beneath. The only color she wore was a pair of blood-red hooker heels. With a platform in front and towering heels in back, with them on, she was only a shade shorter than me. Yet, amazingly, she pranced about in them easily.
“I could have you if I want,” she claimed in the car while I drove to our visit to see the sociologist, Dr. Gavin. I wanted to remain faithful to Cory, our mother, but with my knowledge of Berry’s carnal abilities, the way she looked and looked at me, and the intoxicating scent of her perfume I didn’t want to test my willpower. I feared my little head would win the battle over my big head.
“Still studying Genetic Sexual Attraction and the idea of Consensual Incest, huh?” I asked upon eyeing the material scattered upon the doc’s cluttered desk. I took the available metal folding chair, leaving Berry to find a seat elsewhere. Surprising, without a word or a dirty look, she took the pile of books from the leather wingback chair next to me and placed them on top of an existing tower of books on the doctor’s desk. Then with feline grace, she casually slunk down into the comfy-looking chair, with one leg casually draped over the arm of the chair next to me. Tapping me with her shoe, I looked at her. She gave me a mischievous wink and with an impish grin, she tantalizingly let her red heel dangle from her toes.
“It’s tough. It’s fraught with myths and folklore, pseudo-science, and fiction masquerading as fact. As a scientist, it’s frustrating how much bullshit exists, how distorted everything is, how manipulated and backwards things are,” Dr. Gavin stated. I tried to refocus my attention on him and not my slutty, sexy sister.
“How so?” my mouth wondered while my eyes looked about Dr. Gavin’s office in an attempt to distract me from the she-devil who sat next to me." />
