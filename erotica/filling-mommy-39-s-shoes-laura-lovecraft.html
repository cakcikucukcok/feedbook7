  <title>Filling Mommy&#39;s Shoes - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jeff has a foot fetish that only his departed wife Rachel knew about and indulged. With her gone his fetish has grown to where he&amp;#39;s staring at his daughter, Tammy&amp;#39;s feet and having fantasies of her doing what her mother did for him. When Tammy finds out, she tells him she&amp;#39;d be happy to fill Mommy&amp;#39;s shoes so to speak, but only if her daddy is ready to take care of a lot more than her feet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I think we&amp;#39;re done here,&amp;quot; Jeff announced, once again turning away from her and taking a step towards the door.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If you really want my feet, you can have them.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jeff stopped in mid step. Looking back over his shoulder, he asked. &amp;quot;What did you just say?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If you want to finish what you were doing, I&amp;#39;ll let you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jeff spun around and pointed at her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You wanted to know why I did it, and I told you. Now you&amp;#39;re going to bust my balls?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not making fun of you, daddy,&amp;quot; Tammy slid back on the bed, so her legs were straight out in front of her and he was staring at the soles of her feet. &amp;quot;If it will make you feel better, you can play with them.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If it&amp;#39;ll...&amp;quot; he shook his head. &amp;quot;Tammy, you can&amp;#39;t be serious.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You say I&amp;#39;m a lot like mom and mom always did things to make you happy. If playing with my feet will make you happy and get you over this, then you can do it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;In a screwed way that&amp;#39;s a nice thought.&amp;quot; He briefly stared at her feet and felt a stirring between his legs. &amp;quot;But I can&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You were doing it and would have finished if I didn&amp;#39;t wake up,&amp;quot; she pointed out. &amp;quot;Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be better if I wanted you to?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;This is ridiculous.&amp;quot; Jeff wished his words had more conviction to them, but even as he uttered them, he envisioned how his hard flesh looked between her soft feet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Not really,&amp;quot; Tammy argued. &amp;quot;You need to get over this and this will help.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re my daughter.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Didn&amp;#39;t stop you from touching me a few minutes ago, now did it?&amp;quot; Tammy grinned. &amp;quot;Should I pretend to be asleep?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I said I was sorry!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And I forgive you and want to help.&amp;quot; Tammy touched her chest. &amp;quot;I look just like mom, that&amp;#39;s part of the problem, right?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Kind of.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Then just pretend I&amp;#39;m mom, have your fun and you&amp;#39;ll feel better and we can forget all about this.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jeff lost the battle to try not to think about it. His eyes went back to her feet and his heart beat faster as he thought about how good it had looked, and felt, to be between them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Come on, daddy,&amp;quot; Tammy encouraged. &amp;quot;You know you want to.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She&amp;#39;d lowered her voice to a raspy purr that was identical to Rachel&amp;#39;s bedroom voice&amp;#39; as she dubbed it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I.... can&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot; Unlike her words, Jeff&amp;#39;s came out sounding like a desperate moan as he struggled to do the right thing for the first time tonight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now that she&amp;#39;s offering you don&amp;#39;t want it? He questioned himself even as he took a step towards the bed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Look at them, daddy,&amp;quot; Tammy continued in the same sultry tone. &amp;quot;Look at those pretty toes and those soft sexy feet.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tammy wiggled her toes, then pointed her feet forward so he could stare at the tops of them. The movement caused the muscles in her calves to stand out and his eyes drifted up her insanely long legs and that damn flash of purple between those inviting thighs." />
