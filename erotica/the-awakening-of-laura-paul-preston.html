  <title>The Awakening of Laura -  Paul Preston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the heat of summer in a Southern California seaside town, the spiritual and sensual worlds collide when Laura, a former drama student and lovely wife of a Christian minister becomes sexually attracted to Stephen, a slender spiritually conflicted security guard for submissive female performers at a secret underground theater, the Adam and Eve Club. When Laura meets Stephen at the club to persuade him to rejoin the Christian faith, she is drawn into the theater by a bright hypnotic light.  She watches a pretty submissive performer on the stage engaging in a sexual act while being held in bondage by her Dom. Though initially repulsed, her body responds to the show on a deeply sexual level. She is cornered in the office of the powerful and handsome owner of the club, Phillipe Williamson, and falls deeper into the sensual abyss by becoming his collared submissive. Both Stephen and Williamson vie for Laura&#39;s affection. Laura overcomes the humiliation of being removed from a college play by her father and Stephen finally accepts his true nature as a Dom when Williamson agrees to allow them to perform in a show together at The Adam and Eve Club.  In a dramatic confrontation with her husband, Laura must choose between her role as a minister&#39;s wife and her newly discovered true nature of a sexual submissive. Includes male domination, light consensual bondage, spanking and several highly erotic sexually charged scenes. Paul Preston is an erotic novelist living in Southern California. &quot;The Awakening of Laura&quot; is the first in a trilogy of novels about Phillipe Williamson and the Adam and Eve Club. The other two books in the series, &quot;Bella Lisa and Her Beast&quot; and &quot;The Phantom Phillipe&quot; will also be released by Pink Flamingo Publications." />
