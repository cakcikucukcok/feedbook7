Past Present by Secret Narrative&lt;br /&gt;

Break it to Love by Secret Narrative&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Acts of Pleasure by Poppy Phoenix&lt;br /&gt;

Poppy shares these events, some shocking and some amusing, but all are true and all are from her own real life experiences. They include multiple partners, old and young, threesomes, foursomes, bisexual, group sex, voyeur, spanking and other games as she and her husband Steven embrace the swinging lifestyle for their own pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Under Him by Adele Lee&lt;br /&gt;
Under Him is a true confession of Adele&amp;rsquo;s initiation, which takes place at the hands of handsome Rob. Adele has always loved worldly-wise Rob, who bribes her with the promise of gifts and cash.

Poppy&amp;rsquo;s Party Pieces by Poppy Phoenix&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Kiss From A Ghost by Elizabeth Woodham&lt;br /&gt;
When Chloe Merrywell meets army medic, Dan Archer, her deepest nature is gradually transformed. Chloe embarks upon a journey of discovery and awakens to the delights of faithful sex. She unravels her past from her convent school education and the taste of girls to her seduction at the hands of charismatic Nicholas Kamarovsky. Chloe&amp;rsquo;s lifetime of learning isn&amp;rsquo;t easily undone; her former lovers taunt and tempt and she&amp;rsquo;s torn. The taste of her best friend Suzanne lingers and stimulates the memory of Sister Nuria as Chloe struggles to embrace convention and turn her back on the past for good.&lt;br /&gt;
