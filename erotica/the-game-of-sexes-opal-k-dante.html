  <title>The Game of Sexes - Opal K. Dante</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Evie is twenty years old and has never been with a man. Now she&#39;s  ready to do so. Only the man she&#39;s madly in love with and whom she&#39;s chosen to give her virginity to, is her stepfather, the charming shipping magnate, Sir Sebastian. Evie tries everything to conquer Sebastian, but when she finally manages to win his love, she discovers that that he&#39;s not entirely hers. And it&#39;s not because he hasn&#39;t divorced her mother yet. Soon Evie will discover that her mother is not her real rival.  Their marriage was nothing more than a social façade.Sebastian&#39;s heart is split in two, but her real rival is neither a man nor a woman. Or rather - it&#39;s both together. The perfect man and the perfect woman in the same body. The hermaphrodite captain Sirocco. The mysterious ship VERTIGO is their secret hideaway. What role will Evie play between the two lovers? Very soon life will make it clear that in their case, there are no clear cut male and female roles. Everyone will have to improvise." />
