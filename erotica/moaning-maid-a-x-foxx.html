  <title>Moaning Maid - A.X. Foxx</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mindy is one of the many maids in the Dungeon Towers, an escape for the rich and powerful. She just wants to earn enough money and graduate, then find a proper job. But when she is caught spying on a group of black men with a submissive woman, she falls into the clutches of a powerful man who loses no time punishing her.&lt;br /&gt;
Moaning Maid is a standalone short steamy story features dominating alpha males and submissive young women humiliated and used publicly.&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
The attic was my favorite place in the house. It was mostly abandoned and nobody bothered me when I was there. The room was the only room that wasn&amp;#39;t used as one of the sex rooms in the entire estate.&lt;br /&gt;
Sex was the trade here. Rich men paid big money for the anonymity of being able to let go fully in the safety of the estate.&lt;br /&gt;
The only difficulty they had was trying to find someone to clean up the mess after. While some of the maids were permanent, a few were temporary. It pleased the men to see younger women in sexy maid outfits cleaning up after them. The permanent staff were better at cleaning up the... harder to clean bits, to be honest. I was there as eye candy for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the time, I wasn&amp;#39;t privy to what they were doing. I only needed to appear after they&amp;#39;ve finished. They knew their way around the house better than I did. While some of the men enjoyed dominating, there were some men, otherwise powerful figures in society, who enjoyed being humiliated and demeaned.&lt;br /&gt;
By the time I reached the attic, I realized something was amiss. I was far from alone. There were noises coming from underneath the floorboards.&lt;br /&gt;
I knelt down on the floor and put my cheek to it, trying to hear the words being exchanged beneath me. I couldn&amp;#39;t hear anything beyond murmurs and moans that made my insides tighten.&lt;br /&gt;
I bit my bottom lip and debated in my own mind. I was immensely curious about what was happening downstairs but I also didn&amp;#39;t want to get in trouble for prying.&lt;br /&gt;
I had been working in the place for a little more than half a year now and beyond seeing the men leaving the rooms that smelled excessively of sweat and sex, I had never seen anything first hand before. I heard stories, of course, mostly whispered hastily from the younger maids who were closer to my own age. The older women had been on the job longer and were used to what their jobs entailed.&lt;br /&gt;
I was almost certain that Ashley had never seen anything firsthand before. They were careful not to let the temps know too much.&lt;br /&gt;
I took a deep shuddering breath and crawled quietly to the edge of the attic where I knew I would be able to see everything.&lt;br /&gt;
There was a panel on the floor that I could remove, but I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if I wanted to do that. It was risky. Someone could look up and see me spying.&lt;br /&gt;
A particularly loud scream made up my mind for me." />
