  <title>Storms of Life - Steven Paul-Germane’</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Something was different about my family. I had no idea what it was, but I knew my father, who suddenly, after being assumed missing and possibly dead, just shows up at the front door as if he had never been hurt at all, and Antonio was in a coma after being found by a fisherman.
Dad wasnt acting the same. He looked like him, he sounded like him, but his demeanor was off, and I was bound to prove that he wasnt who he was, especially when he said to me Everything you see is what you see. There were only two people who had said that to me, and that was Victor Grant and Stefano.
And of all people, Victor Grant was claiming to be our real dad and then exposing his true identity as Trenton Stevens, dads so-called brother and our uncle. I couldnt believe the shit that was being said, and it was blowing my mind.
Nothing was adding up. I was gone for two weeks and being questioned by a rookie cop who was assigned to finding Victor Grant since his disappearance. He was hot as fuck, and the only thing I wanted him to do was stay away from me with his questions because I knew me. I was a fairly decent liar but quick study, knowing that if I had to, Id do whatever necessary in order to cover my tracks and get the answers I needed to protect my family.
I still believed family was the enemy, and although they were right under my nose, I couldnt trust them because nothing was as it seemed. And then my brothers started acting strange after a weekend trip. I had to get to the bottom of this one way or the other.
All the money in the world couldnt prepare me for what was coming, and lie after lie, I was going to have to figure it out for myself. Even if I was the one doing the lying at times. There was no way to get to the bottom of this except for playing by Victors rules, and he didnt play fair. In fact, he played very dirty and didnt care who he hurt during the process. Nothing was real anymore." />
