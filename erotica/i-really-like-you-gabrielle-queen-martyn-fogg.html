  <title>I really like you - Gabrielle Queen,  Martyn Fogg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On the outside, it is the boss who is ruthless and the female employee who is beautiful, fascinating and a bit distracted, a bit resigned to what life still has to offer.&amp;nbsp; Deep down inside, instead, they hide two hurricanes &amp;ndash; or rather, two big hearts always in search of something different&amp;hellip; perhaps deep down &amp;ndash; in search of themselves. Milena is the young assistant to the feared Richard Bredson, one of the top tycoons in Italy. There blossoms between them an office romance, an extraordinary attraction at the edge of any human reason, which devours them until they are left stripped of any prejudice and at the same time helps them to rediscover their self-esteem and courage and to finally rediscover themselves like they would never have believed possible. Through this fantastic, marvellous, sudden Love, Richard and Milena simply rediscover themselves. To no longer lose themselves. Because love is also a voyage... marvellous, when made with the right person.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;His sweet mouth searches for mine, I moan in surprise, I cling to him tightly opening myself up like a flower, now I&amp;rsquo;m ready to give him all the purity and sweetness that I have kept for years in search of the right person. I have never kissed anyone under the Autumn rain&amp;hellip;try it, it&amp;rsquo;s very beautiful. &amp;ndash; Mr. Bredson, the cold one &amp;ndash; I whisper with my tongue glued to his, I have discovered that it is my new favourite taste, I could spend hours just enjoying it. Oh, my God, so much emotion! If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for the rain that is refreshing my body and soul I would burst into thousands of pieces with joy, bathing the universe with all the colours of love&amp;hellip; Richard kisses me and kisses me as if he can&amp;rsquo;t stop&amp;hellip; our mouths that have only recently become acquainted take up again the dance interrupted by my absurd fears. We bite each other with our teeth and with our lips, we lick the saliva and drops of slightly salty water that flood our faces, we kiss each other on our cheeks, our eyelids, our foreheads, our chins, our tongues and our teeth.&lt;br /&gt;
We are one, one being of light, desire, love and above all &amp;ndash; infinite, unexpressed need for love&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
