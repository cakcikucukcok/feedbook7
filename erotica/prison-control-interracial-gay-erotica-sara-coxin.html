When he arrives in his cell, he meets Bull, a big black muscular man who is more than unfriendly.&amp;nbsp; To Rick&amp;#39;s dismay, the cell mate he angered before transferring is also in the same prison.&amp;nbsp; He&amp;#39;s beaten up but Bull saves him.&amp;nbsp; The black man lets Rick know that he gets a free save this time, but he&amp;#39;d better be ready to pay him back somehow later.&lt;br /&gt;
