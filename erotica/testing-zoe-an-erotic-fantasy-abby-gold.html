  <title>Testing Zoe: An Erotic Fantasy - Abby Gold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THIS 2018 EBOOK REPUBLISHED THROUGH LULU.COM SUPERSEDES PREVIOUS VERSION PUBLISHED THROUGH SPIRE PUBLISHING, WHICH IS OUT OF BUSINESS
In this male-dom erotic fantasy novel, the beautiful and sensual Zoe submits willingly to her beloved Master Philip, becoming his sex slave and dutifully undertaking the many and varied challenges with which he tests her devotion.
Her adventures include getting regularly spanked as she works topless in a bar; being taken to fetish clubs in bizarre bondage gear; and being trained to be an obedient sauna slave.  Master Philip also tests her by demanding she achieve a higher orgasm quota every day, and then immerses her in sex even more completely by smuggling her onto a ship packed with horny sailors.  Finally he pushes her limits by insisting that she extend her sexual attentions to other women.
Zoe struggles and strives through everything, determined not to disappoint him, and lost in an erotic and escapist world of her own." />
