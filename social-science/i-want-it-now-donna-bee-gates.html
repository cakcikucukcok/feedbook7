  <title>I Want It Now - Donna Bee-Gates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In today&#39;s world of mega-stores and unbridled materialism, people are spending more money than ever in an attempt to find fulfillment in themselves-and children are no exception. In her compelling and inspiring exploration of kids and consumerism, Donna Bee-Gates helps us all understand how a culture of instant gratification influences spending habits and erodes self-worth. She argues that placating kids with material rewards is detrimental to social and psychological development. Similarly, she reveals that kids often seek out material goods as emotional compensation and fall prey to corporate strategies that lure them in as loyal consumers at an early age. Bee-Gates brings together cutting-edge research and interviews to show that a healthy childhood sometimes means a simpler one--one that values good communication and interaction with peers and family. She highlights strategies to counter materialism and foster stronger identities in our children as they navigate a complex world, and discusses ways that we can help build self-awareness in children and encourage skills that will help them become adults with strong character and integrity." />
