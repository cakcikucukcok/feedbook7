  <title>A Nation at Risk - Peter Wuteh Vakunta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Nation at Risk: A Personal Narrative of the Cameroonian Crisis&lt;/i&gt; should be construed as a requiem for what used to be known as the Republic of Cameroon. The overriding objective of this book is to shine the searchlight on the dysfunctional government of Cameroon under President Paul Biya, a minuscule man and matching mind, endowed with a gargantuan ego. Those who wish to comprehend the apocalypse toward which the Cameroonian nation has been propelled by the rogue government of Mr. Biya would do well to study the minds of the men at the helm. Mr. Biya and his henchmen enjoy playing at and for power. The politics of power is for them an act of intellectual masturbation. Even the diabolism inherent in the phenomenon of power is something they relish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Nation at Risk, Peter Wuteh Vakunta, a prolific writer in his own right, has successfully pieced together a compelling narrative of the many facets of the crisis that has plagued Cameroon during the more than three-decade presidency of Mr. Paul Biya. Lucid and captivating, this landmark volume provides a seminal contribution to readers appreciation of the social, political, economic and cultural events that have shaped Cameroons history from the time of independence from colonial masters to date. Vakuntas penetrating analysis of the lackluster governmental modus operandi of President Biya is a must read for all Cameroonians and friends of Cameroon who feel deeply about the future of this often forgotten African nation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
