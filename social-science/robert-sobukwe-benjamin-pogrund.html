  <title>Robert Sobukwe - Benjamin Pogrund</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On 21 March 1960, Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe, leader of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), led a mass defiance of South Africa&#39;s pass laws. He urged blacks to go the nearest police station and demand arrest. When police opened fire on a peaceful crowd in the township of Sharpeville, 68 people were killed. The protest changed the course of South Africa&#39;s history. Afrikaner rule stiffened and black resistance to apartheid went underground. Sobukwe was jailed for three years on charges of incitement, but the government, fearful of his power, rushed through the &#39;Sobukwe Clause&#39; to keep him in prison without trial. For the next six years, Sobukwe was kept in solitary confinement on Robben Island, the infamous apartheid prison near Cape Town. How Can Man Die Better is the story of this South African hero, but it also the story of the friendship between Robert Sobukwe and Benjamin Pogrund, former Deputy Editor of the Rand Daily Mail. Their joint experiences and debates chart the course of a tyrannical regime and the growth of black resistance." />
