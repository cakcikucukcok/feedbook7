  <title>Losing Legitimacy - Clifton W. Sherrill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book contends that the transition of leadership from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei will result in a crisis of legitimacy for the Islamic Republic of Iran. Using Max Weber&amp;rsquo;s typology of legitimacy, the book explains that the Islamic Republic&amp;rsquo;s legitimacy was based on the charismatic authority of the regime&amp;rsquo;s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Since Khomeini&amp;rsquo;s death in 1989, the regime has failed to develop the rule of law necessary for legal-rational authority. Moreover, it abandoned the logical underpinnings justifying clerical rule when a mid-ranking cleric rather than a Grand Ayatollah was placed in the position of Supreme Leader. With neither a legal basis nor a traditional basis of authority, the new leader relied extensively on the cover of Khomeini&amp;rsquo;s charismatic shadow for legitimacy. After nearly four decades, this shadow is fading. Not only will Khamenei&amp;rsquo;s successor lack the same direct ties to Khomeini, but the demographic and societal changes in Iran have made the charisma of Khomeini a historical concept rather than a viscerally felt experience. First the book analyzes the likely succession scenarios, finding the most probable outcome is the appointment of a hardline conservative backed by the regime&amp;rsquo;s security forces. Next, the regime&amp;rsquo;s economic, political, and social failures are presented, in order to explain why the new leader is likely to try to return to a traditional basis of legitimacy &amp;ndash; religion. Thereafter, the book explains how this hardliner focus on religion is likely to result in an aggressive Iranian foreign policy toward the United States, Israel, and Saudi Arabia, impacting the region&amp;rsquo;s security.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
