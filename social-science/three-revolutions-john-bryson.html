  <title>Three Revolutions - John Bryson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three Revolutions in the Equatorial Americas.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A volume of three feature pieces treating revolutions in each of Panama, Nicaragua and the building of tensions in Haiti.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. In Panama, a Pantomime.&lt;br /&gt;Billed as support for a rebellion against General Noriega, the US invaded Panama for Christmas 1989. A year later Western expatriates in their clubs and enclaves were still divided.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;GENERAL NORIEGA&#39;S portrait stood on the hotel bar, his cap crusted with laurels, stars the length of his epaulets, his cheeks pocked and grainy. The camera had caught him reviewing a parade.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2. The Play of Children.&lt;br /&gt;In Port o Prince, Haiti, waiting for the elections, tension builds, as does the heat. Here, we sit in a restaurant, speaking of Haitian artistries, during a power failure.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We were all eyes, in this dusk. Mme Du Paix said, &#39;The Voodoo has taken over the Naive in our culture. No artistry speaks without voodoo.&#39;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3. The Fall of Old Managua.&lt;br /&gt;The Nicaraguan revolution split families, none more than the Reyes, in which two brothers each became prominent leaders of opposing factions. In the first free elections in a decade, during the period in which President Reagan was still denying collaboration with the Contras, the US backed faction lead by Violetta Chamorro took government." />
