  <title>Corporate Governance Framework in Nigeria - Olusola A. Akinpelu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since her political independence from the British government in 1960, Nigeria has gone through different phases in the effort to develop the corporate sector. The intention was to drive the economy through corporate enterprises; however, the absence of effective corporate governance structure and conducive investment environment has no doubt been a source of concern for investors and successive governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meticulously researched and organized, this book takes the global view on corporate governance to provide insight into the corporate governance conundrum in Nigeria. Against the background of international standard, Author, Olusola A. Akinpelu proposes a number of reforms to the existing governance structure and delves into the history of corporate development from the 1960s through the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Akinpelu offers an in-depth analysis of the philosophical foundations for corporate governance and compiles the theories, models, statutes, reforms, international standards, guidelines, and legal cases on corporate governance in the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States of America, and elsewhere to show how no country is completely immune from corporate collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A timely work, &lt;i&gt;Corporate Governance Framework in Nigeria&lt;/i&gt; will interest students of business economics, business law, legal practitioners, and researchers in the field of corporate governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
An excellently well written book on all important subject of socio-economic value and relevance.
