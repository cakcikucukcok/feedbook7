  <title>Bachelor Girl - Betsy Israel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this lively and colorful book of popular history, journalist Betsy Israel shines a light on the old stereotypes that have stigmatized single women for years and celebrates their resourceful sense of spirit, enterprise, and unlimited success in a world where it is no longer unusual or unlikely to be unwed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing extensively on primary sources, including private journals, newspaper stories, magazine articles, advertisements, films, and other materials from popular media, Israel paints remarkably vivid portraits of single women -- and the way they were perceived -- throughout the decades. From the nineteenth-century spinsters, of New England to the Bowery girls of New York City, from the 1920s flappers to the 1940s working women of the war years and the career girls of the 1950s and 1960s, single women have fought to find and feel comfortable in that room of their own. One need only look at Bridget Jones and the &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; gang to see that single women still maintain an uneasy relationship with the rest of society -- and yet they radiate an aura of glamour and mystery in popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As witty as it is well researched, as thoughtful as it is lively, &lt;em&gt;Bachelor Girl&lt;/em&gt; is a must-read for women everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;" />
