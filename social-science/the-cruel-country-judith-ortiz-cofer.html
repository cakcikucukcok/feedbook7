  <title>The Cruel Country - Judith Ortiz Cofer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&quot;I am learning the alchemy of grief&amp;#8212;how it must be carefully measured and doled out, inflicted&amp;#8212;but I have not yet mastered this art,&quot; writes Judith Ortiz Cofer in &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The Cruel Country&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;. This richly textured, deeply moving, lyrical memoir centers on Cofer&amp;#8217;s return to her native Puerto Rico after her mother has been diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cofer&amp;#8217;s work has always drawn strength from her life&amp;#8217;s contradictions and dualities, such as the necessities and demands of both English and Spanish, her travels between and within various mainland and island subcultures, and the challenges of being a Latina living in the U.S. South. Interlaced with these far-from-common tensions are dualities we all share: our lives as both sacred and profane, our negotiation of both child and adult roles, our desires to be the person who belongs and also the person who is different.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What we discover in &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The Cruel Country &amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;is how much Cofer has heretofore held back in her vivid and compelling writing. This journey to her mother&amp;#8217;s deathbed has released her to tell the truth within the truth. She arrives at her mother&amp;#8217;s bedside as a daughter overcome by grief, but she navigates this cruel country as a writer&amp;#8212;an acute observer of detail, a relentless and insistent questioner.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;" />
