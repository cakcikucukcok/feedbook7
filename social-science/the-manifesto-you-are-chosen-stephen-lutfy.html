  <title>The Manifesto: You Are Chosen - Stephen Lutfy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The synopsis of this book entails that Morality is superior to immorality first and foremost. It is also important to note that Moral Voluntary Socialist Government is the only Government structure, never created by mankind to save all individuals from slavery. This book also talks about the future of socio-economic politics. With that being said, freedom of rational decisions is key to making sure a Government survives and Morality and True Love are upheld forever and always, protected by Government, Individuals, and Private Business. That no other individual gets in the way of your choices, unless done voluntarily through the collective, whom serve as reassurement that friendship and fun is a reward of hard work and dedication. Also, that Our Holy Father is watching over us making sure we make the right moves to have a clean soul and that Our Morality matches up with how our lives in the After-Life conclude to a beautiful beginning. With all these facets of Government available to the working Public, anyone can be John Galt; but Morality must be practiced daily and yearly to make sure that a healthy life upholds, protects, and serves Humanity in the best way shape and form of what the present or future needs to survive." />
