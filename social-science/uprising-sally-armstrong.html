  <title>Uprising - Sally Armstrong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From Africa to Asia to the Americas, women are the key to progress on ending poverty, violence, and conflict. Award-winning humanitarian and journalist Sally Armstrong shows us why empowering women and girls is the way forward, and she introduces us to the leading females who are making change happen, from Nobel Prize winners to little girls suing from justice. &lt;i&gt;Uprising &lt;/i&gt;tells dramatic and empowering stories of change-makers and examines the stunning courage, tenacity and wit they are using to alter the status quo. From mud-brick houses in Afghanistan to the forests of Congo, where women still hide from their attackers, to a shelter in northern Kenya, where 160 girls between 3 and 17 have won an historic court case against a government who did not protect them from rape, to Pakistan, where Malala Yousafzai is fighting for the rights of women everywhere, &lt;i&gt;Uprising &lt;/i&gt;is about the final frontier for women: having control over your own body, whether in zones of conflict, in rural villages, on university campuses or in your own kitchen. In this landmark book that ties together feminism and our global economy, Sally Armstrong brings us the voices of the women all over the world whose bravery and strength is changing the world as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
