  <title>America Adrift—Righting the Course - John W. Zimmerman Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The values that made America a great and respected nation are in decline causing consequences across all segments of our society. In this passionate and deeply personal account, author John W. Zimmerman Sr. issues a call to all Americans to take up this challenge and preserve Americas promise, dream, and survival for all who follow. A roadmap and workable solutions to reclaiming our country, &lt;i&gt;America Adrift-Righting the Course&lt;/i&gt;, is a wake-up call for young, old, and everyone in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Zimmermans analysis of moral relativity in our culture is beyond question. Unlike other writers who only trade in self-righteously denouncing our culture, he sensitively describes the problems and offers inspiration and practical suggestions to turn people around, so that they can develop themselves, achieve their goals, and make a lasting contribution to others. It is a book I would want to give to my children and to my retiree friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted Schroder, pastor, Amelia Plantation Chapel, Amelia Island, Florida&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People and cultures are always confronted with change which can be represented from impending doom to opportunity waiting to be seized. In these troubled times when we all feel apprehension for what is coming next down the road, John shows us a light at the end of the tunnel. He tells it like it is, how it can be, and what it takes to get there. I highly recommend this book for everyone regardless of age or social standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Gower, president and founder, MATRIX Resources, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am donating my profits from this book to Boys and Girls Clubs of America. They do so much to develop the values of young people to make them respected and contributing
adults.&lt;/p&gt;" />
