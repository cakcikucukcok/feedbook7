  <title>Government Gone Wild - Kristin Tate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;With humor and a modern perspective, young conservative journalist Kristin Tate points out what&#39;s broken in our government and shows readers how they can fix it. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Do you really think you&#39;re &quot;free?&quot; #LOL.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;D.C. politicians ship our friends and family overseas to fight in wars we shouldn&#39;t be fighting. They monitor our emails, record our phone calls, and peer into our snail mail. They spend our hard-earned cash on things no disciplined family would buy. They tell us who we can marry and what we can put in our bodies. They throw us in overcrowded prisons for smoking pot. They take lavish trips around the world, staying in five-star hotels... and it comes straight out of our paychecks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This isn&#39;t freedom.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Government Gone Wild is a brash, bold ride through the carnival of absurdities that our broken system has become. This isn&#39;t about Democrats vs. Republicans... it&#39;s about inspiring hard working Americans to give a damn so we can take our country back. This is your wakeup call. You&#39;re not anywhere near as free as you think you are - &lt;b&gt;but you can be&lt;/b&gt;. We&#39;re not as prosperous as we once were - &lt;b&gt;but we can be&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
