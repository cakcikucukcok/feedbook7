  <title>Songs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven and Other Plays - Young Jean Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bold, unguarded work . . . that resists pat definition. [Young Jean] Lee has penned profane lampoons of motivational bromides (&lt;i&gt;Pullman, WA&lt;/i&gt;) and the Romantic poets (&lt;i&gt;The Appeal&lt;/i&gt;).
