  <title>Dogs and Demons - Alex Kerr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The crises--and failures--of modernization in Japan, as seen up close by a resident expert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan is a nation in crisis, and the crisis goes far beyond its well-known economic plight. In &lt;i&gt;Dogs and Demons&lt;/i&gt;, Alex Kerr chronicles the crisis on a broad scale, from the failure of Japan&#39;s banks and pension funds to the decline of its once magnificent modern cinema. The book takes up for the first time in the Western press subjects such as the nation&#39;s endangered environment--its seashores lined with concrete, its roads leading to nowhere in the mountains. It describes Japan&#39;s &quot;monument frenzy,&quot; the destruction of old cities such as Kyoto and construction of drab new cities, and the attendant collapse of the tourist industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these unhealthy developments are, Kerr argues, the devastating boomerang effect of an educational and bureaucratic system designed to produce manufactured goods--and little else. A mere upturn in economic growth will not quickly remedy these severe internal problems, which Kerr calls a &quot;failure of modernism.&quot; He assails the foreign experts who, often dependent on Japanese government and business support, fail to address these issues. Meanwhile, what of the Japanese people themselves? Kerr, a resident of Japan for thirty-five years, writes of them with humor and passion, for &quot;passion,&quot; he says, &quot;is part of the story. Millions of Japanese feel as heartbroken at what is going on as I do. My Japanese friends tell me, &#39;Please write this--for us.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
