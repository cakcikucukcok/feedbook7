  <title>Bleeding Mountains of Nepal - Asitya Man Shrestha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Whether it is politics, journalism or literature the most talked about topic today is undoubtedly corruption. This book deals with it throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each page of &lt;I&gt;Bleeding Mountains of Nepal&lt;/I&gt; is a ghastly tale of how the country is run by people whose unsaturated greed and avarice for power and perks and their dereliction of duty may be unmatched by anyone anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is a verification of how national resources, funds and revenue, foreign loans and assistance are pillaged, pilfered, plundered, abducted, swindled, embezzled, robbed, looted and predated by the very bottom to the top level in the government machinery and also by those outside the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole book is a document of how the country is being fleeced, milked and wrenched at all times by the insiders, outsiders, donor agencies and the NGOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It speaks of Nepal and its teeming millions squirming below the poverty line, forever exploited.  It is a story of Nepals failed development of the last fifty yearsthe tears behind the smilethe smile that does not reach the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is particularly helpful to those who want to write, study and research on corruption and mismanagement in Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;" />
