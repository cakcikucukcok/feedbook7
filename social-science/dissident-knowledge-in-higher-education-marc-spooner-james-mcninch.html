  <title>Dissident Knowledge in Higher Education - Marc Spooner, James McNinch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“Fueling the current onslaught on higher education is the perfect storm of neoliberalism at its apex, totalitarianism on the rise, and enduring legacies of colonialism, white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, and imperialism. Education has never been guarded from such forces, but nor has it ever been free of contestation, and higher education in particular has long perpetuated injustice even as it seeded revolutions. Such is the searing analysis and nurturing of hope offered by an all-star collection of scholars.”—Kevin Kumashiro, author of Bad Teacher!: How Blaming Teachers Distorts the Bigger Picture
“The space for dissent and democratic debate is quickly shrinking both in public life and academic institutions. This volume helps readers ask critical and conscious questions about what it means to contend for truth.”—Gloria Ladson-Billings, author of The Dreamkeepers
“This book maps the path toward a university based on ethics and justice rather than corporate needs. It reaches anyone who wants to understand the social, political, and economic trends that define our times.”—William Ayers, author of Teaching with Conscience in an Imperfect World
“[A] rich examination of the impact of corporatization of our universities, as well as how they can be reclaimed.”—James Turk, editor of Academic Freedom in Conflict" />
