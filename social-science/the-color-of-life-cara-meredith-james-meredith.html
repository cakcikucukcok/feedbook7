  <title>The Color of Life - Cara Meredith, James Meredith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cara Meredith grew up in a colorless world. From childhood,&amp;nbsp;she didn&#39;t think issues of race had anything to do with her. A colorblind rhetoric had been stamped across her education, world view, and&amp;nbsp;Christian&amp;nbsp;theology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then as an adult, Cara&#39;s life took on new, colorful hues. She realized that her generation, seeking to move beyond ancestral racism, had swung so far that they tried to act as if they didn&#39;t see race at all. But that picture neglected the unique cultural identity God gives each person.&amp;nbsp;When Cara met and fell in love with the son of black icon, James Meredith, she began to listen to the stories and experiences of others in a new way, taking note of the cultures, sounds and shades of&amp;nbsp;life already present around her.&amp;nbsp;After she married and&amp;nbsp;their little family grew to include two mixed-race sons, Cara knew she would never see the world through a colorless lens again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A writer and speaker&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;an interracial marriage and&amp;nbsp;mixed-race&amp;nbsp;family, Cara finds herself more and more in the middle of discussions about racial justice. In&amp;nbsp;The Color of Life,&amp;nbsp;she asks how do we navigate ongoing and desperately-needed conversations about race? How do we teach our children a theology of reconciliation and love? And what does it mean to live a life that makes space for&amp;nbsp;seeing the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;imago Dei&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;in&amp;nbsp;everyone? Cara&#39;s illuminating memoir paints a beautiful path from white privilege&amp;nbsp;toward&amp;nbsp;racial healing, from ignorance&amp;nbsp;toward&amp;nbsp;seeing the image of God in everyone she meets.&lt;/p&gt;" />
