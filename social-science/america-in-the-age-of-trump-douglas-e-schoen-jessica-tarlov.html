  <title>America in the Age of Trump - Douglas E. Schoen, Jessica Tarlov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;America in the Age of Trump&lt;/em&gt; is a bracing, essential look at the failure of a great nation to meet the needs of its people and the challenges of the age&amp;mdash;and the resulting collapse of public trust in government, as well as a pervasive crisis of national values, from broken families to a loss of faith in the American idea itself. This crisis of values occurs just as the country faces an unprecedented array of fiscal, economic, social, and national-security challenges&amp;mdash;out of control federal spending, frighteningly large deficits, massive gaps of income and opportunity, cultural division, and a dangerous world in which American power seems increasingly incidental.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;America in the Age of Trump&lt;/em&gt;, Douglas E. Schoen and Jessica Tarlov offer a definitive and unique assessment of a nation in turmoil, looking beneath well-known problems to identify underlying yet poorly understood causes. Readers will confront the crises, one by one: of trust, values, and governance; of education, economic opportunity, and fiscal solvency; of national security, domestic tranquility, and race relations. &lt;em&gt;America in the Age of Trump&lt;/em&gt; gathers in one place a clear and comprehensive evaluation of the fundamental issues confronting the American future while offering bold, fresh approaches to meeting these challenges. Other books have described the specter of American decline, but none has been so comprehensive in its diagnosis or forward-looking&amp;mdash;and non-ideological&amp;mdash;in its remedies, explaining how we might yet overcome national self-doubt to reclaim our traditional optimism, reassert our place in the world, and secure a prosperous future for our citizens.&lt;/div&gt;" />
