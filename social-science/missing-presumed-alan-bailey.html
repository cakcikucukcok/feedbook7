  <title>Missing, Presumed - Alan Bailey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Between 1993 and 1998, six Irish women, ranging in age from eighteen to twenty eight, disappeared. The area in which these disappearances occurred became publicly referred to as &#39;The Vanishing Triangle&#39;. To date, none of the missing females have ever been located. These six unsolved cases resulted in the creation of the specialist Garda task force &#39;Operation Trace&#39;, set up in the hope of finding a connection between the missing women. None was found. The task force investigated dozens of unsolved cases of women gone missing in Ireland. Alan Bailey served as the National Coordinator for the task force for thirteen years, and the revealing stories in Missing, Presumedall come from his personal experiences in this role. Missing, Presumed details, and reports on, the Garda investigations into the case studies of fifteen women who disappeared over a time span of twenty years. In almost half of the cases, the women&#39;s badly mutilated bodies were recovered, sometimes months later, buried in shallow graves. Each chapter focuses on one woman&#39;s story, and details the timeline of events that led to her disappearance, beginning on the day of her disappearance through to the ensuing investigation, and up to - when lucky - a conviction. These stories are haunting, terrifying, and true. &#39;It is now sixteen years since Trace was established. The families and friends of both the disappeared and those whose bodies were found still await closure.&#39;" />
