  <title>Menopause – The Commonsense Approach - Ruth Appleby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The menopause is a natural stage in every woman’s life. Now, thanks to &lt;i&gt;Menopause &amp;ndash; The CommonSense Approach&lt;/i&gt;, a practical and optimistic guide to the menopause experience, you can get through it with grace and confidence.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many women can go through this process naturally and gracefully while retaining their vitality and energy. However, recent over-emphasis on the difficulties of the menopause have led it to be labelled as a ‘condition’ that needs intervention and treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homeopath Ruth Appleby approaches menopause in a positive and sensible way. She explains what it is, the early signs to watch out for and exactly what changes will occur in the body. From hot flushes to thinning hair, she has menopause covered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She also gives advice on how to improve your overall state of health, believing that women who have general good health should experience fewer problems. For those who do have difficulties she suggests many natural and holistic solutions: diet, exercise, homeopathy, herbal remedies, supplements and Hormone Replacement Therapy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &lt;i&gt;CommonSense Approach&lt;/i&gt; series is a series of self-help guides that provide practical and sound ways to deal with many of life’s common complaints. Each book in the series is written for the layperson, and adopts a commonsense approach to the many questions surrounding a particular topic. It explains what the complaint is, how and why it occurs, and what can be done about it. It includes advice on helping ourselves, and information on where to go for further help. It encourages us to take responsibility for our own health, to be sensible and not always to rely on medical intervention for every ill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other titles in the series include &lt;i&gt;Depression &amp;ndash; The CommonSense Approach&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Headaches &amp;ndash; The CommonSense Approach&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Stress &amp;ndash; The CommonSense Approach&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;Menopause &amp;ndash; The CommonSense Approach&lt;/i&gt;: Table of Contents&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;Preface&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is Health? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Early Symptoms of Menopause&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Later Symptoms of Menopause&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Menopause&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Osteoporosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diet and Exercise for Good Health During Menopause&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stress and Relaxation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hormone Replacement Therapy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Homeopathy &amp;ndash; How it Can Help During Menopause&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Case Histories&lt;/li&gt;Charts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
