  <title>Feminist Praxis Revisited - Amber Dean, Jennifer L. Johnson, Susanne Luhmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Feminist Praxis Revisited&lt;/i&gt;, Women’s and Gender Studies (WGS) practitioners reflect on how the field has sought to integrate its commitment to activism and social change with community-based learning in post-secondary institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching about and for social change has been a core value of the field since its inception, and co-op, practica, and internships have long been part of the curriculum in the professional schools. However, liberal arts faculties are increasingly under pressure to integrate community engagement practices and respond to labour market demands for greater student “employability.” That demand creates challenges and possibilities as WGS programs and instructors adapt to changing post-secondary agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book examines how WGS programs can continue to prioritize the foundational critiques of inequality, power, privilege, and identity in the face of a post-secondary push toward praxis as resumé building, skills acquisition, and the bridging of town-and-gown differences. It pushes students to reflect critically on their own experiences with feminist praxis through critical reflections offered by the contributors along with examples of practical approaches to community-based/experiential learning.&lt;/p&gt;" />
