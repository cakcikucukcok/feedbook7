  <title>Challenging the Myths of Gender Equality - Michael Muonwe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="CHALLENGING THE MYTHS OF GENDER EQUALITY: THEOLOGY AND FEMINISM
The book offers critical insight into the significance of synergy between feminist theory and theological anthropology in combating sexism in our society today. The analysis of feminisms challenge of male-chauvinistic discourse that has been for centuries an instrument of patriarchal manipulation is very elucidating. The authors use of Genesis creation narrative to show how God intends that all live in love and communion, and show equal regard to each other is exceptionally provocative. Even though Michael believes that Jesus may not be rightly termed a feminist in the modern understanding of the term, he demonstrates how Jesus critical stance towards some androcentric structures of his day is a testimony to his vision and mission of inclusive kingdom where all are equal. The book is very important for anyone committed to ensuring a society devoid of gender-based discriminations and violence.
Prof. Dr. Annemie Dillens remarks on the book is worth noting: Michael Muonwe has made it clear that the experiences by women of social exclusion and disadvantage require a thorough dialogue between feminism and Christianity. In a global context where Christianity and feminism are mutually condemning each other, this book offers a profound insight into many differences within feminism and feminist theology, and thus avoids all-too-easy generalizations Both the author and his work continue to encourage me, and I hope all readers will also acknowledge the value, the richness, and the joy of doing theology (Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium).
According to Prof. em. Dr. Peter Schmidt, This book should be known by many, not only by those who are already engaged on the problem of gender inequality, but maybe still more by those who have no real knowledge of the problem and its urgency. The author is not only an expert on the matter, but both his clarity of thought and style, and his genuine commitment to the cause make it a most commendable reading (Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium)." />
