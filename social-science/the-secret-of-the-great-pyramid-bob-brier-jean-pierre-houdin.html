  <title>The Secret of the Great Pyramid - Bob Brier, Jean-Pierre Houdin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, French architect Jean-Pierre Houdin became obsessed by the centuriesold question: How was the Great Pyramid built? How, in a nation of farmers only recently emerged from the Stone Age, could such a massive, complex, and enduring structure have been envisioned and constructed? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboring at his computer ten hours a day for five years&amp;#8212;creating exquisitely detailed 3-D models of the Pyramid&#39;s interior&amp;#8212;Houdin finally had his answer. It was a startling revelation that cast a fresh light on the minds that conceived one of the wonders of the ancient world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by world-renowned Egyptologist Bob Brier in collaboration with Houdin, &lt;em&gt;The Secret of the Great Pyramid&lt;/em&gt; moves deftly between the ancient and the modern, chronicling two equally fascinating interrelated histories.

Here also is the riveting story of Jean-Pierre Houdin&#39;s single-minded search for solutions to the mysteries that have bedeviled Egyptologists for centuries, such as the purpose of the enigmatic Grand Gallery and the Pyramid&#39;s crack.&lt;/p&gt;" />
