  <title>A Haiti Chronicle - Daniel  Whitman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Counselor for Public Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince in 1999-2001, Daniel Whitman was haunted by the country&#39;s people and landscapes, its nuanced language, and complex and rewarding friendships. 
&lt;p&gt;His friends included neighbors, art gallery owners, gas station attendants - but mostly Haiti&#39;s intrepid journalists and broadcasters.  Unlike others, Whitman believed that the three elections of 2000 could advance Haiti&#39;s democracy and its development from the bottom rung as poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere. He was wrong; they did not. Local supremacists killed, torched and rushed to fraud while foreigners forgave and even blessed the electoral debacles without posing the resistance even of meaningful public comment. 
&lt;p&gt;However, seeds also germinated to make Haiti one day fit for its inventive, humor-loving and too often betrayed people. The effort was kept alive largely by Haiti&#39;s gritty journalists, going into hiding when necessary for their survival, but newly organized in October of 1999, into a tenacious and daring national federation. The nation-wide Haitian Press Federation advanced against all odds, and held eight regional meetings which changed political discourse forever in Haiti. The country now enters a post-Aristide interlude. The failure of one regime does not guarantee success for the next. A Haiti Chronicle offers recent context for understanding Haiti&#39;s current crisis, and opportunity." />
