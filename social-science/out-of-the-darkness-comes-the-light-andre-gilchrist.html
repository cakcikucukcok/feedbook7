  <title>Out of the Darkness Comes the Light - Andre Gilchrist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&quot;Out of the Darkness Comes the Light&quot;, &lt;/STRONG&gt;is a novel written by Andre Gilchrist. This novel follows the authors first book &lt;STRONG&gt;&quot;You Thought You Couldn&#39;t Change, Either&quot;,&lt;/STRONG&gt; which was a true and actual account of the life of Andre Gilchrist. This is a novel based on the fact that much of the book comes from actual facts while other parts are derived from the authors life experiences and events the author has lived through.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; The background information in this novel is actual. The author took an enormous amount of time researching the information from family members still alive, documents that have been saved and passed on from one generation to another to have the story as true and credible as possible. The main action takes place in a fictitious town called Hopesville, Michigan.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; The author through much of his life experiences during the course of the novel covers the time periods covering much of the civil rights area extending from Brown vs Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas in May, 1954 to and including other events lasting to the race riots in Newark, New Jersey and Detroit, Michigan in July of 1967. The novel touches on major events occurring in the present day such as hijacking and terrorism.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; The main theme that the author is trying to touch on in this novel is that there is always hope, hence comes the name of the town Hopesville. The author believes that when we cease to believe in hope we close the door to the future. The author wants to impress to those reading this manuscript that no matter how dark and gloomy and totally helpless and hopeless the times might seem to us and we feel that there is no reason to continue that &lt;STRONG&gt;Out of the Darkness Comes The Light!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
