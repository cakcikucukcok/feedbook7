  <title>Next Stop, Reloville - Peter T. Kilborn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;An eye-opening investigation of the growing phenomenon of &quot;Relos,&quot; the professionals for whom relocation is a way of life&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drive through the newest subdivisions of Atlanta, Dallas, or Denver, and you&#39;ll notice an unusual similarity in the layout of the houses, the models of the cars, the pastimes of the stay-at-home moms. But this is not your grandparents&#39; suburbia, &quot;the little houses made of ticky-tacky&quot;--these houses go for half a million dollars and up, and no one stays longer than three or four years. You have entered the land of Relos, the mid-level executives for a growing number of American companies, whose livelihoods depend on their willingness to uproot their families in pursuit of professional success. Together they constitute a new social class, well-off but insecure, well traveled but insular. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter T. Kilborn, a longtime reporter for &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, takes us inside the lives of American Relos, showing how their distinctive pressures and values affect not only their own families and communities but also the country as a whole. As Relo culture becomes the norm for these workers, more and more Americans--no matter their jobs or the economy&#39;s booms and busts--will call Relovilles &quot;home.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
