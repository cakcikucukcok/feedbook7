  <title>Unconventional, Partisan, and Polarizing Rhetoric - Jeanine E. Kraybill, Ivy A. M. Cargile, Alison Howard, Raul Madrid Jr....</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The rhetoric and political communication of the 2016 Presidential Election was arguably unconventional, partisan, and polarizing&amp;mdash;becoming a defining characteristic of the tone and feel of the campaign. In this volume we examine how rhetoric and various political communication strategies influenced and shaped the contours of the election and ultimately its outcome. Witnessing the most diverse electorate in U.S. political history, we look at how voters were primed for an anti-establishment/outsider candidate and how various rhetorical and communication appeals were used to strategically engage different groups of voters and at times, leave out or even scapegoat others. We also analyze how rhetoric and political communication shaped the debate on key issues such as climate change, immigration, national security, gender, and representation. In an age where having a social media presence is an essential campaign tool, we examine how Twitter was used by candidates and its impact on the electorate and news coverage. Overall, we demonstrate that political rhetoric and communication is impactful, bearing electoral consequences and the potential for policy outcomes, giving the reader much to consider as we approach the next midterm and general election.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
