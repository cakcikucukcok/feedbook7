  <title>12 Titanic Lessons for Christians: Lessons to Motivate, Challenge and Empower - Jr. Charles C. Hagan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Titanic disaster of April 15, 1912 has been described as one of the most fascinating single events in human history.  The sinking of the Titanic has left an indelible impression and vast psychological impact on the world.  Titanic has spawned books, plays, poems, films, drama films, songs, concerts, musicals, novels, video games, newsreels, slideshows, multimedia works, and works of art.  It has been noted that Titanic spawned the largest number of songs regarding any disaster or event in American history. The event became a popular theme for balladeers, blues, bluegrass and country singers in the Southern United States. British songwriters commemorated the disaster with appeals religious, chauvinistic, and heroic sentiments.  One person has  suggested that the reaction to the Titanic can only be compared to the assassinations of Lincoln and Kennedy.  The three most written about subjects since April 1912 are Jesus, the American Civil War, and Titanic. The story of the RMS Titanic has been interpreted in numerous ways-as a symbol of technological hubris, a classic disaster tale, an indictment regarding class divisions of the society at that time, a kind of morality play, a romantic tragedy, and somewhere between a Greek and Elizabethan tragedy.  There have been so many books written about the Titanic that there are very few that will tell you anything new, but every now and then you find an absolute gem. Charles Hagan&#39;s book adds to the Titanic story with his 12 Titanic Lessons for Christians! There are danger lessons, time lessons, and motivational lessons all culled from the disaster that was Titanic!" />
