  <title>Can the World Tolerate an Iran with Nuclear Weapons? - Amos Yadlin, Charles Krauthammer, Vali Nasr, Fareed Zakaria...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With tensions between Iran, Israel, and Western powers reaching new highs over the Islamic Republic&amp;#8217;s nuclear enrichment program, the tenth edition of the Munk Debates investigates how the world should respond to Iran&amp;#8217;s nuclear ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, the case for a pre-emptive strike on Iran is ironclad. An Iranian bomb would flood the volatile Middle East with nuclear weapons and trap Israel in a state of perilous insecurity &amp;#8212; along with much of the world&amp;#8217;s oil supply. Others argue that a nuclear Iran could be the very stabilizing force that the region needs, as the threat of nuclear war makes conventional conflicts more risky.
