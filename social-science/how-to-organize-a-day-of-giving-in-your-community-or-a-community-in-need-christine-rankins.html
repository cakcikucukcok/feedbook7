  <title>How to Organize a Day of Giving in Your Community or a Community in Need - Christine Rankins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book describes How to Organize A Day of Giving in your community or a community in need.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It also describes why we need A Day of Giving, with statistics on Hunger in America, Homelessness, the New Poor, Number of Homeless shelters, and Unemployment rates. Why A Day of Giving is the answer by describing what it is and how it works. This book gives the history of the event and it success. It shows that anyone with a HEART can do it. Christines testimony on how God supernaturally used her through a willing vessel. It describes the Masters plan with the meaning behind it. It gives the step by step process for planning, organizing, recruiting volunteers, and securing sponsors. This book offers conclusions, encouragements and acknowledgements along with forms and sample sponsorship letters with pictures and commendations for present and previous works. These are good reasons to get involve by organizing A Day of Giving in your community or a community in need.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hunger in American:&lt;br&gt;
Hunger in America is out of control when people have to line up to get food from food pantries, church pantries and/or homeless shelters. There was a report on the new hunger in America since the recession from Web history. It listed 12% of California households struggle with hunger between 2006 and 2008, but likely higher to this date.  Hunger in America stated that in Illinois rising demands on food banks, especially in Cook County has these types of customers: middle class and suddenly out of work in the midst of the recession. According to Feeding America, the National Hunger-Relief Network did a study on the fact that Cook County is not the only county struggling and to be fair  the demand has increase 65% in DuPage County, where it was not considered a major problem to go hunger until the recession hit hard. It was the feelings of shame and embarrassment among the newly poor that brought these people to another countys food pantry in order not to be recognized in their own countys food pantry. If they did not go, they do not eat.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Detroit, MI has the highest unemployment in the nation, so they struggle with hunger and housing. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
New York has the largest increase in demand for food assistance since 1991; this is not just about California, Illinois, Michigan or New York because people are hunger all over the USA and world, especially kids. This breaks my HEART to see or hear of kids or anybody hunger from the lack of food.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is why part of the proceeds from the sale of this book will be donated to each states food depositories so they can supply food to food pantries and homeless shelters, etc. I need everyone to buy this book to lend a helping hand to others in need.  Part of the proceeds from sale of this book will help Haiti for a month. Thanks and God bless!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Personally speaking, this is not a black or white problem because it affects all people, which makes this a sad story when so many people are hunger. HELP!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Homelessness in USA:&lt;br&gt;
Homelessness statistics cover areas related to the homeless and hunger and include numbers of the highest rate of increase since the recession of 1991. The largest and fastest growing homeless are families. Because there are so many homeless people, they have setup new tent cities and other large homeless encampments to keep up with the demands. This is by National Alliance to end Homelessness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tents cities highlights are the new realities as recession wears on after foreclosures force families from their homes, March 26, 2009.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Economy Bytes reported on May 18, 2010, the National Alliance presents the state of doubled-up families. The brief examines the implications of the increase in doubled-up families and reflects on how the situation speaks to the recessions impact of homelessness.
