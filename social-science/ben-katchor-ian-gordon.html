  <title>Ben Katchor - Ian Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;Author Michael Chabon described Ben Katchor (b. 1951) as &quot;the creator of the last great American comic strip.&quot; Katchor&#39;s comic strip &lt;i&gt;Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer: Stories&lt;/i&gt;, which began in 1988, brought him to the attention of the readers of alternative weekly newspapers along with a coterie of artists who have gone on to public acclaim. In the mid-1990s, NPR ran audio versions of several Julius Knipl stories, narrated by Katchor and starring Jerry Stiller in the title role.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An early contributor to &lt;i&gt;RAW&lt;/i&gt;, Katchor has contributed to &lt;i&gt;Forward&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Slate&lt;/i&gt;, and weekly newspapers. He edited and published two issues of &lt;i&gt;Picture Story&lt;/i&gt;, which featured his own work, with articles and stories by Peter Blegvad, Jerry Moriarty, and Mark Beyer. In addition to being a dramatist, Katchor has been the subject of profiles in the &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;, a recipient of a MacArthur &quot;Genius Grant&quot; and a Guggenheim Fellowship, and a fellow at both the American Academy in Berlin and the New York Public Library.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Katchor&#39;s work is often described as zany or bizarre, and author Douglas Wolk has characterized his work as &quot;one or two notches too far&quot; beyond an absurdist reality. And yet the work resonates with its audience because, as was the case with Knipl&#39;s journey through the wilderness of a decaying city, absurdity was only what was usefully available; absurdity was the reality. &lt;i&gt;Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer: Stories&lt;/i&gt; presaged the themes of Katchor&#39;s work: a concern with the past, an interest in the intersection of Jewish identity and a secular commercial culture, and the limits and possibilities of urban life.&lt;/br&gt;" />
