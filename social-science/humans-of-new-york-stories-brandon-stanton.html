  <title>Humans of New York: Stories - Brandon Stanton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Now a #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times Bestseller! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In the summer of 2010, photographer Brandon Stanton began an ambitious project -to single-handedly create a photographic census of New York City. The photos he took and the accompanying interviews became the blog &lt;i&gt;Humans of New York.&lt;/i&gt; His audience steadily grew from a few hundred followers to, at present count, over eighteen million. In 2013, his book &lt;i&gt;Humans of New York,&lt;/i&gt; based on that blog, was published and immediately catapulted to the top of the &lt;i&gt;NY Times Bestseller List &lt;/i&gt;where it has appeared for over forty-five weeks. Now, Brandon is back with the &lt;i&gt;Humans of New York&lt;/i&gt; book that his loyal followers have been waiting for: &lt;i&gt;Humans of New York: Stories&lt;/i&gt;. Ever since Brandon began interviewing people on the streets of New York, the dialogue he&#39;s had with them has increasingly become as in-depth, intriguing and moving as the photos themselves. &lt;i&gt;Humans of New York: Stories&lt;/i&gt; presents a whole new group of people in stunning photographs, with a rich design and, most importantly, longer stories that delve deeper and surprise with greater candor. Let Brandon Stanton and the Humans of New York he&#39;s photographed astonish you all over again." />
