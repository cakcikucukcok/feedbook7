  <title>Armageddon: How Trump Can Beat Hillary - Dick Morris, Eileen McGann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt; Bestseller&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;AT STAKE: THE FUTURE OF AMERICA&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The 2016 election is truly America&#39;s Armageddon&amp;#151;the ultimate and decisive battle to save America, a fight to defeat Hillary Clinton and the forces seeking to flout our constitutional government and replace it with an all-powerful president backed up by an activist judiciary that answers to no one. Already President Obama has moved America far down this path, and a President Clinton will act as his &quot;third term,&quot; institutionalizing the excesses of the past eight years. In &lt;I&gt;Armageddon&lt;/I&gt;, bestselling author and political strategist Dick Morris provides a winning game plan to take back the White House, and America. Because this is our last chance:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#149; Our last chance to stop socialist uniformity, corruption and executive usurpation&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#149; Our last chance to curb welfare programs that are destroying the economic and social fabric of the nation&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#149; Our last chance to secure our border and keep our sovereignty&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#149; Our last chance to stand up against ISIS and terrorism&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#149; Our last chance to protect the Second Amendment&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We can do it. We must. It&#39;s our last chance. Read &lt;I&gt;Armageddon&lt;/I&gt;, or risk losing the battle to save America!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On Tuesday, November 8, 2016, American voters will make a momentous decision.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They will decide whether or not this great country will remain a free market, constitutional democracy. The stakes could not be higher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If Hillary Clinton is elected president, it will mean the end of the America we know and love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Armageddon&lt;/I&gt;, by &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt; bestselling authors Dick Morris and Eileen McGann, is a call to arms, a call to join that ultimate battle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Few know Hillary Clinton better than Dick Morris. For almost two decades he served as a special adviser to both her and her husband, Bill Clinton. He knows their strengths, their vulnerabilities, and even their deepest secrets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Armageddon&lt;/I&gt;, Morris offers a manual on how to win this battle and defeat Hillary once and for all. He argues that a typical Republican campaign won&amp;#8217;t work&amp;#151;and that Hillary&amp;#8217;s opponent must strike her in a very unorthodox and powerful way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Morris says it&amp;#8217;s a winning strategy and voters play a critical role.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;A noted political strategist, Dick Morris has created winning strategies for numerous presidential campaigns in the U.S. and abroad. In this book he lays out a war plan, one the Republican nominee must use to prevent her victory:&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#149; Throw a surprising right jab: terrorism and healthcare&lt;br&gt;&amp;#149; Throw the left hook: jobs, immigration, Wall Street&lt;br&gt;&amp;#149; Play her game on class warfare: women, Latinos, and young voters&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Republicans need to stop playing by the old rules of the game. Those rules don&amp;#8217;t work&amp;#151;they elected Barack Obama twice. Obama has changed America in fundamental ways and Morris posits that Hillary&amp;#8217;s opponents need to grasp this and implement a strategy that can finally defeat her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
