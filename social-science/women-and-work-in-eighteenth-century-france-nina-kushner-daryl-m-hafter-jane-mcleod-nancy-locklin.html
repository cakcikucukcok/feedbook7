  <title>Women and Work in Eighteenth-Century France - Nina Kushner, Daryl M. Hafter, Jane McLeod, Nancy Locklin...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the eighteenth century, French women were active in a wide range of employments-from printmaking to running whole-sale businesses-although social and legal structures frequently limited their capacity to work independently. The contributors to Women and Work in Eighteenth-Century France reveal how women at all levels of society negotiated these structures with determination and ingenuity in order to provide for themselves and their families. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent historiography on women and work in eighteenth-century France has focused on the model of the &quot;family economy,&quot; in which women&#39;s work existed as part of the communal effort to keep the family afloat, usually in support of the patriarch&#39;s occupation. The ten essays in this volume offer case studies that complicate the conventional model: wives of ship captains managed family businesses in their husbands&#39; extended absences; high-end prostitutes managed their own households; female weavers, tailors, and merchants increasingly appeared on eighteenth-century tax rolls and guild membership lists; and female members of the nobility possessed and wielded the same legal power as their male counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examining female workers within and outside of the context of family, Women and Work in Eighteenth-Century France challenges current scholarly assumptions about gender and labor. This stimulating and important collection of essays broadens our understanding of the diversity, vitality, and crucial importance of women&#39;s work in the eighteenth-century economy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
