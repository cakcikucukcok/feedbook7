  <title>Fighting Dirty - Poh-Gek Forkert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Chosen by &lt;em&gt;Now Magazine&lt;/em&gt; as one of the &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nowtoronto.com/art-and-books/books/18-must-read-books-for-fall-2017/&quot;&gt;18 must-read books for fall 2017&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fighting Dirty&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of how one small group of farmers, small-town residents, and Indigenous people fought the world&amp;#8217;s largest waste disposal company to stop them from expanding a local dumpsite into a massive land fill. As one of the experts brought in to assess the impact the toxic waste would have on the community, Poh-Gek Forkert was part of the adventures and misadventures of their decades-long fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Fighting Dirty&lt;/em&gt; is an inspiring read for all activists battling against the money and power of corporations.  It shows that when a small group of determined, committed citizens don&amp;#8217;t give up, leaders and unexpected opportunities will emerge. When the cause is just, good people can win.&amp;#8221;  —&lt;strong&gt;David Suzuki, internationally-renowned environmentalist&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Fighting Dirty&lt;/em&gt; is a primer for citizens’ groups battling against powerful corporations attempting to override sensible environmental planning. But more than that it tells the story of a community of rural agricultural and Indigenous peoples pulled together by a need to protect the land they love. It’s well worth the read.” —&lt;strong&gt;Gord Miller, ecologist, former Environmental Commissioner of Ontario&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is nothing as divisive or as exhausting for a rural community as having to fight a corporate waste giant. The story of how a leaking local dump was purchased by the largest waste corporation in the world and then promoted as a mega-landfill for Ontario makes for chilling reading. &lt;em&gt;Fighting Dirty&lt;/em&gt; is essential for anyone interested in issues of environmental justice, public process, and the power of grassroots citizen activism.” —&lt;strong&gt;Charlie Angus, author of &lt;em&gt;Unlikely Radicals: The Story of the Adams Mine Dump War&lt;/em&gt;
