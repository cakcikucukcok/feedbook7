  <title>You-Turn - Lynne Avery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The United States, as well as most of the world, is sitting upon a precipice of economic collapse, which will likely lead not only to the loss of our affluence but of our freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a child in the fifties, despite the problems that existed, our nation was more honest, unified and free. Although we were far less affluent back then, most people felt connected and life had meaning. This book is a memoir of the 1950s when people believed in the Golden Rule, even if we could not always live by it. It is a personal recollection of the moral you-turn we took in the late 1960s and the consequences that change has had on how we live today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past fifty years we have increasingly embraced the me first mentality that is the underlying cause of our decline.  We cannot really love others, nor can we fix the problems of our nation if all we think about is ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we, with Gods help, find a place in our hearts for each others needs, the resulting honesty, good will and unity will be the foundation upon which we begin to rebuild America.&lt;/p&gt;" />
