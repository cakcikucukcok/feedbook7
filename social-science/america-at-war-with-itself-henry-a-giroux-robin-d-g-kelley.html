  <title>America at War with Itself - Henry A. Giroux, Robin D.G. Kelley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From poisoned water and police violence in our cities, to gun massacres and hate-mongering on the presidential campaign trail, evidence that America is at war with itself is everywhere around us. The question is not whether or not it&#39;s happening, but how to understand the forces at work in order to prevent conditions from getting worse. Henry A. Giroux offers a powerful, far-reaching critique of the economic interests, cultural dimensions, and political dynamics involved in the nation&#39;s shift toward increasingly abusive forms of power. His analysis helps us to frame critical questions about what can and should be done to turn things around while we can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on a wide range of social issues, Giroux contrasts Donald Trump&#39;s America with Sandra Bland&#39;s to understand who really benefits from politically fueled intolerance for immigrants, communities of color, Muslims, low-income families, and those who challenge state and corporate power. A passionate advocate for civil rights and the importance of the imagination, Giroux argues that only through widespread social investment in democracy and education can the common good hope to prevail over the increasingly concentrated influence of extreme right-wing politicians and self-serving economic interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Praise for &lt;I&gt;America at War with Itself&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is the book Americans need to read now. No one is better than Henry Giroux at analyzing the truly dangerous threats to our society. He punctures our delusions and offers us a compelling and enlightened vision of a better way. America at War with Itself is the best book of the year.&quot;&amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;Bob Herbert&lt;/B&gt;, Distinguished Senior Fellow at Demos and former Op-Ed columnist for the &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In this current era of corporate media misdirection and misinformation, &lt;I&gt;America at War with Itself&lt;/I&gt; is a must read for all Americans, especially young people. Henry Giroux is one of the few great political voices of today, with powerful insight into the truth. Dr. Giroux is defiantly explaining, against the grain, what&#39;s REALLY going on right now, and doing so quite undeniably. Simply put, the ideas he brings forth are a beacon that need to be seen and heard and understood in order for the world to progress.&quot;&amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;Julian Casablancas&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In &lt;I&gt;America at War with Itself&lt;/I&gt;, Henry Giroux again proves himself one of North America&amp;#8217;s most clear-sighted radical philosophers of education, culture and politics: radical because he discards the chaff of liberal critique and cuts to the root of the ills that are withering democracy. Giroux also connects the dots of reckless greed, corporate impunity, poverty, mass incarceration, racism and the co-opting of education to crush critical thinking and promote a culture that denigrates and even criminalizes civil society and the public good. His latest work is the antidote to an alarming tide of toxic authoritarianism that threatens to engulf America. The book could not be more timely.&quot;&amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;Olivia Ward&lt;/B&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Toronto Star&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;I&gt;America at War with Itself&lt;/I&gt; makes the case for real ideological and structural change at a time when the need and stakes could not be greater. Everyone who cares about the survival and revival of democracy needs to read this book.&amp;#8221;&amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;Kenneth Saltman&lt;/B&gt;, Professor, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, Author of &lt;I&gt;The Failure of Corporate School Reform&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Henry A. Giroux&lt;/B&gt;&#39;s most recent books include &lt;I&gt;The Violence of Organized Forgetting &lt;/I&gt;and &lt;I&gt;America&#39;s Addiction to Terrorism&lt;/I&gt;.
