  <title>THE FUTURE OF DEMOCRACY: Lessons From the Past and Present To Guide us on our Path Forward - Steve Zolno</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is democracy and where did it come from? Is it a new development or was it always present in human society? And perhaps the most important question: what can we do to preserve and strengthen democracy among the forces that oppose it? In this book we explore trends throughout history that have brought democratic - and undemocratic - government to people wherever civilization exists. We discuss where democracy has been most, and least, successful and why. But our most important task is to clarify what each of us can do, as politicians or ordinary citizens, to bring the benefits of democracy more fully into the personal and political lives of those who cherish it.  Includes the section: Guide to Voting in a Democracy" />
