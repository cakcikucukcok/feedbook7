  <title>How to Slowly Kill Yourself and Others in America - Kiese Laymon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Author and essayist Kiese Laymon is one of the most unique, stirring, and powerful new voices in American social and cultural commentary. &lt;I&gt;How to Slowly Kill Yourself and Others in America&lt;/I&gt; is a collection of Laymon&#39;s essays, touching on subjects ranging from family, race, violence, and celebrity to music, writing, and coming of age in the rural Mississippi Gulf Coast. Laymon&#39;s writing is unflinchingly honest, while also being smart, lacerating, and unexpectedly funny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;How to Slowly Kill Yourself and Others in America&lt;/I&gt;, Laymon deals in depth with his own personal story, which is filled with trials (and reflections on those trials) that illuminate under-appreciated aspects of contemporary American life. As revealed in the book&#39;s title essay, Laymon attended three colleges before earning his undergraduate degree. He was suspended from the first of these institutions, Millsaps College, following a probationary period resulting from a controversial essay he published on campus. As the school&#39;s president described it, the &quot;Key Essay in question was written by Kiese Laymon, a controversial writer who consistently editorializes on race issues.&quot; Controversy seemed to follow this young writer, but as he himself puts it, &quot;my job is to ask questions, to broaden the scope of American literature by broadening the scope of who is written to and imaginatively writes back.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Laymon voice is something new and unexpected in contemporary American writing, mixing a colloquial voice with acerbic wit, sharp insights, and blast-furnace heat that calls to mind no one so much as a black 21st-century  Mark Twain. Much like Twain, Laymon&#39;s writing is steeped in controversial issues both private and public. From his biting critiques of race politics to revelations of his own internal struggles with American &quot;blackness,&quot; Laymon taps into an ongoing conversation that is played out consciously and subconsciously across all of our artistic, cultural, political, and economic realities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This collection introduces Laymon as a writer who balances volatile concepts on a razor&#39;s edge, and who chops up much-discussed and often-misunderstood topics with his scathing humor and fresh, unexpected takes on the ongoing absurdities, frivolities, and calamities of American life.&lt;/div&gt;" />
