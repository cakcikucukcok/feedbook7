  <title>Latino and Muslim in America - Harold D. Morales</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;Latino and Muslim in America&lt;/em&gt; examines how so-called &quot;minority groups&quot; are made, fragmented, and struggle for recognition. The U.S. is poised to become the first nation whose collective minorities outnumber the dominant population, and Latinos play no small role in this world-changing demographic shift. Even as many people view Latinos and Muslims as growing threats, Latino Muslims celebrate their intersecting identities in their daily lives and in their mediated representations.
In this book, Harold D. Morales follows the lives of several Latino Muslim leaders from the 1970&#39;s to the present, tracing their efforts to organize and unify nationally in order to solidify the new identity group&#39;s place within the public sphere. Drawing on four years of media analysis, ethnographic and historical research, Morales demonstrates that Latinos embrace Islam within historically specific contexts that include distinctive immigration patterns and new laws, urban spaces, and media technologies that have increasingly brought Latinos and Muslims into contact. He positions this growing community as part of the mass exodus out of the Catholic Church, the growth of Islam, and the digitization of religion. &lt;em&gt;Latino and Muslim in America&lt;/em&gt; explores the interactions between religion, race, and media to conclude that these three categories are inextricably entwined." />
