  <title>Right Before His Very Eyes - Donovan Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a story about people whose ancient way of life is threatened by social upheaval and violence. It is a story of Africans (black, brown and white) during the convulsive height of apartheid  made worse by the great power struggle for Africa during the incredible Cold War. It is a story of people caught in something they do not understand.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But, the story is about more than this. It is also about the dilemmas that people have when face to face with a vastly different culture. It is about their helplessness as events wash over them, as modernization steals their children and as hard times reach into their homes.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;The story is also about the suffering of ordinary people when big men step into the breach in Africa, to exploit, intimidate and struggle with each other for power and riches.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;Issues of socioeconomic development come alive through the story. Peoples lives are seen in relation to the initiatives of development organizations.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;But this is not a story entirely about the negative side of life. It is told through the touching lives of people who manage remarkably well. It is a story of people from vastly different backgrounds who have hope where there is little room for it, civil relations where there should be antagonism, patience in the face of extreme frustration and who trust in an atmosphere of suspicion. The story is at times even amusing. It takes place in a complicated, fascinating and overwhelmingly beautiful part of the world." />
