  <title>Ike Would Be Proud - C. Richard Peterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
	Dick Peterson has written this book about the Eisenhower Fellows, and for the Fellows.  He has chosen to focus on two very visible examples of the Fellows leadership and networking  the Irish Peace Process and ProyectoCities.  As an active EF Trustee since 1994, Dick has become convinced that these models can be adapted and applied by Fellows around the world in ways that will make a real difference in their communities and regions.  He is absolutely right.  I am confident that his two case studies will serve as inspiration to many other groups of Eisenhower Fellows who are already working together to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrian A. Basora&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrian Basora is President of the Eisenhower Fellowships.  He is a former U.S. Ambassador to the Czech Republic.  Adrian was Ambassador to Czeckslovakia at the time of the Velvet Revolution which created a separate Slovakia from the Czech Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Dick Peterson has splendidly combined his experience as a CEO, his command of organizational development, and affection for Eisenhower Fellowships.  The result is a fertile study of two of the most important team projects among Fellows, of which many more are latent around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theodore Friend&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theodore Friend, former President of Swarthmore College, and President Emeritus of Eisenhower Fellowships, was awarded the Bancroft Prize for his book on Philippine-American history, Between Two Empires.  His other books include The Blue-Eyed Enemy and Family Laundry, a novel.  Dr. Friend is presently a Senior Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia.  His latest book, Indonesian Destinies (Harvard University Press, 2003) penetrates events that gave birth to the worlds fourth largest nation and assesses the continuing dangers that threaten its security.&lt;/p&gt;" />
