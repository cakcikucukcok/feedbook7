  <title>Child Soldiers - Dr. U C Jha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As many as fifty non-state armed groups (NSAGs) in countries such as Afghanistan, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Libya, Mali, Pakistan, the Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, Thailand and Yemen are engaged in the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict. In Somalia, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen the situation continues to be perilous, with many hundreds of children recruited, used, killed and maimed. Children have been used by the NSAGs as executioners and suicide bombers. By an estimate, there are 300,000-350,000 child soldiers worldwide and the alarming trend continues to grow. According to the United Nations, there has been a fivefold increase in the number of children recruited in a few ongoing armed conflicts. 
This book gives an up-to-date and comprehensive analysis of the recruitment and use of child soldiers worldwide; and examines the (in) adequacy of international institutions and laws in protecting children. It is an invaluable resource for anyone interested or working in the field of protecting children: teachers, students, lawyers, government officials, military and police personnel, researchers and human rights activists." />
