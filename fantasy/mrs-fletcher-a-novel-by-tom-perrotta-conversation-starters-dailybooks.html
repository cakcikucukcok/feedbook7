  <title>Mrs. Fletcher: A Novel by Tom Perrotta | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Mrs. Fletcher: A Novel by&amp;nbsp;Tom Perrotta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt; | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In her mid-40s, divorced, and with an empty nest, Eve Fletcher is unsure what to do next in life. One night, she receives a mysterious text message calling her a &amp;quot;MILF.&amp;quot; She becomes obsessed with the text message, which leads her to a pornography website. Before long, Eve has become obsessed with pornography, as well, which causes her to act out in ways she never thought she would act. Meanwhile at college, Brendan is loved by his partying friends, but finds that his grades suffer because of his lifestyle. He also finds that not everyone is tolerant of his chauvinistic attitudes towards sex. As mother and son explore their sexuality and freedom, they also find themselves in hot water because of it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mrs. Fletcher became a New York Times bestseller upon its release in 2017. The New York Times called it both funny and grim. Kirkus Reviews praised author Tom Perrotta for his &amp;quot;spot-on satire.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
