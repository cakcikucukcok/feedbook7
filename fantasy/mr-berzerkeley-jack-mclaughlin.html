  <title>Mr. Berzerkeley - Jack Mclaughlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ask anyone: Jim Sain is a pompous, naked, free thinker. Hes also the mayor of Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of his high school chums has moved back to renovate Hamilton House, one wacky adventure at a time, and who knows whats coming next? The mayor has been dubbed mR. bERZERKELEY by a cartoonist who is determined to embarrass him (and undermine his bid for reelection). His personal life is as colorful as his political life. He gives his detractors plenty of fodder to fuel his demise (but in his eyes, these are not signs of moral weakness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this spoof that cheerfully brings the sixties into the twenty-?rst century, Jims bu?oonery as he interacts with boarding-house residents creates a wild smorgasbord of political, mysterious, sexual, and otherwise edgy adventures. A cartoonist, a nave freshman, a reformed prostitute, lesbian lovers, a sarcastic cook, the deformed son of a university bigwig, and a Kansas politician are some of the characters who spark energy back into the old house and bring classic Berkeley lore back to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;  mR. bERZERKELEY&lt;/i&gt; is Jack McLaughlins love song to a city like no other." />
