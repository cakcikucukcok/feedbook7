  <title>A Smoking, Deadly Summer in Indy - E. Marvin Neville</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When E. Marvin Neville left Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1980, it could have been called the most boring place on earth. Then, something happened: Indy started to grow way beyond the bounds of its Indy 500 image. It is now a vibrant, energetic metropolis, overwhelmed with events, entertainment, and tourist traps. 
But with change comes conflict. The murder rate in Indianapolis is sky-high. You cant turn a corner without running into a drug deal. Bad education system, bad parenting, bad economyyou name it; there is a bad side to Indy, and its this bad side Neville dives into with his edgy ten story collection, &lt;i&gt;A Smoking, Deadly Summer in Indy.&lt;/i&gt;
Nevilles Indianapolis exists only in shadow. Its that dark silhouette you see from the corner of your eye that disappears when you turn to look. Nevilles Indy is rife with the mysterious and sinful, told with an honest, sexy voice that lulls you into false safety. This Indy is filled with the supernatural, the evil, and the downright strange." />
