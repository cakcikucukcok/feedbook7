  <title>Had the Queen Lived: - Raven A. Nuckols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This fictional what if thriller is the first in a series by author Raven A. Nuckols that examines the life and times of Queen Anne Boleyn, her heirs and explores what might have happened had she not been executed in May 1536. 
Anne was the second wife of King Henry VIII of England, serving from 1533-1536 until she was beheaded on false charges of treason, adultery, and incest with her brother, as she was accused by Thomas Cromwell, the Lord Privy Seal. Prior to her tragic downfall,  Anne was the main catalyst for England&#39;s break with the Roman Catholic Church during the Reformation. Henry&#39;s intense passion for her, fed by her refusals, ignited a fire that tore the country apart. This book evaluates the history of how different England might have been had factors leading up to her execution not have happened. Would Anne have continued her passion for religious reforms? Would she eventually have made enemies of Cromwell? What would have become of her friends and enemies? Would she have given Henry the longed-for male heir? What would have become of Elizabeth? All of these questions and more are answered!" />

Nuckols' alternate history Had the Queen Lived: An Alternative History of Anne Boleyn is a most interesting conceit. Written in the form of a history rather than a fiction, it puts forward an imagined Tudor history in which Anne Boleyn was not tried and executed for adultery and treason, but instead lived to be Henry VIII's consort throughout his reign.<br /><b><i>Had the Queen Lived: An Alternative History of Anne Boleyn ...</i></b> | Had the Queen Lived is a charming book. It's not formatted as a novel, instead a biographical book. That might turn people off but if you can get past the format it's an interesting read. Raven A. Nuckols writes the non fictional people with an open mind. For example, Anne is scheming and manipulative but she loves Henry and is trying to do good.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Had the Queen Lived: - Raven A.
