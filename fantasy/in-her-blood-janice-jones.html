  <title>In Her Blood - Janice Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alex Stone wants to pretend the supernatural doesn&amp;#39;t exist. As the owner of a hot new clothing line, the only thing she&amp;#39;s killing is her competition - until she gets a phone call from her past.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the Dagger, she was a member of the covert ops team tasked with hunting threats of the supernatural kind. For the super soldiers of Night Command, the rules were simple: take the pills, fight the bad guys, and live to tell no one. After putting a bad-ass vampire on ice landed her in a padded cell, Alex thought she&amp;#39;d left the hunting game for good. Now she&amp;#39;s in the orbit of a handsome vampire with a problem. And sometimes keeping secrets bites.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jason Stavros has the best of everything and life eternal. To the human world, Jason was just a poor boy who made it to the top. For a human turned vampire, the fight for a place in the inner circle of the ruling class hinges on one task: convince the best ex-vampire hunting assassin to become his personal bodyguard and save them all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Join Alex, Jason and a new team of young hunters as two worlds unite against a common enemy. As the body count begins to rise, Alex and the Tracker Team fight friends and enemies to find the answers they seek. What&amp;#39;s been happening in the dark will finally come to light.&lt;/p&gt;" />
