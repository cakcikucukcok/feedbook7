  <title>Unleash the Night - Sherrilyn Kenyon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;It&#39;s a predator eat predator world for the Were-Hunters. Danger haunts any given day. There is no one to trust. No one to love. Not if they want to live...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An orphan with no clan that will claim him, Wren Tigarian grew to adulthood under the close scrutiny and mistrust of those around him. A forbidden blend of two animals--snow leopard and white tiger--Wren has never listened to anyone when there was something he wanted. Now he wants Marguerite.&lt;br&gt;Marguerite D&#39;Aubert Goudeau is the daughter of a prominent U.S. Senator who hates the socialite life she&#39;s forced to live. Like her mother before her, she has strong Cajun roots that her father doesn&#39;t understand. Still, she has no choice but to try and conform to a world where she feels like an outsider. But the world of rich and powerful humans is never to meet the world of the Were-Hunters who exist side by side with them, unseen, unknown, undetected. To break this law is to call down a wrath of the highest order.&lt;br&gt;In order to have Marguerite, Wren must fight not just the humans who will never accept his animal nature, but the Were-Hunters who want him dead for endangering their world. It&#39;s a race against time and magic without boundary that could cost Marguerite and Wren not just their lives, but their very souls...&lt;/p&gt;" />
