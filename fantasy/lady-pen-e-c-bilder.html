  <title>Lady Pen - E. C. Bilder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lady Pen is designed to be a whimsical tale of magic and adventure. It centers on a retired lady and her two beloved cats, Nova and Adolph. The lady loves to write, and she always addresses her pen as if it were a living being, helping her with the magic of the words. 
One evening, after the retired lady leaves the room, lo and behold, the pen comes to life! She introduces herself to Nova and Adolph as Lady Pen, and instructs them not to tell anyone about her, even though she gives them the ability to speak. Instead, she asks them to meet her later that night for a wonderful adventure. 
When midnight comes, Lady Pen takes Nova and Adolph throughout various settings of great natural beauty. She introduces them to a variety of mythical creatures, with whom the cats have a great party and a hotly contested race. When the wizard Zadwir appears and tries to ruin the party, he does so by challenging the cats to another race. They are triumphant, and as dawn rises and the cats return home, they do so eager for their next adventure. 
Lady Pen may be of particular interest to young readers who are cat lovers. In addition, because of its message about looking beneath the surface to see beauty and meaning. It may appeal to parents as well.
