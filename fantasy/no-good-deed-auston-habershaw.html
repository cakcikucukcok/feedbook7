  <title>No Good Deed - Auston Habershaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cursed with a magic ring that forbids skullduggery, Tyvian Reldamar&amp;#8217;s life of crime is sadly behind him. Now reduced to fencing moldy relics and wheedling favors from petty nobility, he&amp;#8217;s pretty sure his life can&amp;#8217;t get any worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is until he hears that his old nemesis, Myreon Alafarr, has been framed for a crime she didn&amp;#8217;t commit and turned to stone in a penitentiary garden. Somebody is trying to get his attention, and that somebody is playing a very high-stakes game that will draw Tyvian and his friends back to the city of his birth and right under the noses of the Defenders he&amp;#8217;s been dodging for so long. And that isn&amp;#8217;t even the worst part. The worst part is that the person pulling all the strings is none other than the most powerful sorceress in the West: Lyrelle Reldamar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyvian&amp;#8217;s own mother.&lt;/p&gt;" />
