  <title>Memoirs of a Fallen Angel - Deeton Charles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angela is one of 10 daughters of two fallen Angels who came to Earth to keep a war from erupting in Heaven over a forbidden affair.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Her tribe comes in contact accidentally with Adam and Eve&amp;rsquo;s tribe of eight sons. Hidden secrets come to light regarding the Angel clan and Angela fights to save her family from an evil that seeks to control Earth and all its inhabitants. Angela is asked by God to complete a mission that is crucial to the salvation of Humanity and bring back the balance that was lost when the Angel war erupted on Earth. She must find Cain, for he alone has the power to restore free will and agency on the suffering planet. But Cain has fallen in with the legion of the damned and is aiding them in their war against the Rainbow tribe of human Angels. Angela must overcome vampires, demons, fallen angels, and evil humans to restore the balance among the seven tribes of humanity, as well as the five original human clans, who now have blended with the Angel tribe and carry unique abilities. This provocative theory crosses Christianity and Paganism exploring a story that throws light upon many legendary myths, folklores, Superstitions and beliefs regarding Angels, Demons, Vampires, Shape-shifters, Werewolves, Witches, Fortune Tellers, Psychics, Mind Readers, Gods, Goddesses, Mother Earth, and the missing link, Heaven and Hell.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Memoirs of a Fallen Angel&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a thought provoking and engaging theory about the Human Origins on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
