  <title>The Dark Legend - Steven Leone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With no memory of his past life, a teenage Len awakens in a dangerous military prison. His only allies are nine others like him-called &quot;prototypes&quot; by their captors, who are after an ancient relic. Little do they know that a more ancient force of pure evil is also after that relic. And they&#39;re willing to kill for it. Caught up in between the chaos, Len and his new friends must race against both sides to get the relic back first and stop the rise of the Dark Legend. Whether fighting hordes of wolves, kidnapping the governor with a psychopath, or unraveling the mystery of who they really are, the young prototypes have much to endure.
