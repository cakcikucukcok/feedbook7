  <title>Dragon Spell: Fated Touch Book 1 - Mac Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jane is a normal orphan with unusual grandparents. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t realize how unusual until she returns on holiday from college to discover that her grandmother has been kidnapped. Her grandfather reveals that her kidnappers are a new foe from an old world, and her grandmother&amp;rsquo;s only hope is for them to travel to the other side after her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Shifting World, however, isn&amp;rsquo;t as easy as ours. Every monster, witch, demon, and other mystical fable that haunts the fairytale books of our world resides among those lands. Jane finds herself stumbling through one adventure after another as she tries to learn the ropes, and the magic, of the new world in order to save her grandmother, and herself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even a place as strange as the Shifting World, however, has its familiar handsome men. One of them is Caius, a dragon shifter with a sly smile and a glint in his eyes. He joins their search for her missing grandmother, but Jane isn&amp;#39;t so sure it isn&amp;rsquo;t another member of her family that he&amp;rsquo;s interested in." />
