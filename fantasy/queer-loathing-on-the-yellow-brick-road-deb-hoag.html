  <title>Queer &amp; Loathing on the Yellow Brick Road - Deb Hoag</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dorothy isn’t the happiest of girls. Kansas is pretty damn boring, her aunt and uncle are hicks, and it seems she doesn’t much belong. But when her shed gets picked up by a cyclone and dropped in Oz, things begin to get interesting. There’s this broad called Glinda who’s taken more than a bit of a liking to her, and perverted munchkins who run a tabloid newspaper full of green celebrity snatch. There’s also Ozma, who runs Oz’s only transgender helpline—and who is toe-curlingly hot by the way. Between silver shoes and matching purses, politics and dildos, lesbian witches and wizards with gambling debts, Dorothy must find her way home (wherever that might be)—and figure out who really makes her heels click." />
