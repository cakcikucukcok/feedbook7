  <title>The Dragon Inside - J. A. Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On the planet of Naronna, Brie was a simple bakery owner who kept to herself. No one suspected her to be a runaway from a powerful royal family from Malta. Her life was about to change when that dragon inside of her no longer was content to remain dormant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bries real name is Brieanika, and she holds several royal titles on two separate planets. Since she ran away she managed to live her life the way she liked for over a thousand years, but it had all come to an end. Royal guards were sent to retrieve her so she could learn how to control the dragon and to become one with it. Though she dreaded returning to the life that she didnt know, she had no choice but to join her people and fulfill her destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this exciting fantasy tale, accompanied by Trace, her Sentinel, and a few friends, Brie rediscovers her heritage, stumbles through her new life within the royal court, and learns what it really means to be a dragon. While doing all of that, she must continue to do everything in her power to thwart the plans of the person intent on ending her life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
