  <title>The Fledging of Hawkwings - Katherine A Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jessika, Kassandra, Rikah, and Karolan found a home among the wild griffins and there grew safely towards adulthood, but they have never forgotten the home they came from: the conquered kingdom of Northnest. Certainly Jessika has not. She was third born of the royal children. Northnest is both her birthright and her people, taken by wizards and their swarms of drakes. Now the girl has become a woman, and she thinks to reclaim her country. Being raised by griffins, far from human cities and society, has its drawbacks, however. She can&amp;rsquo;t possibly know what obstacles she will face in her venture. The conquerors still hold her country and aren&amp;rsquo;t inclined to give it back. The people, too, have learned to live with them and aren&amp;rsquo;t eager for another war. Worst of all is the danger she brings onto her adoptive griffin family, as any reckless move could reveal to the conquerors the presence of the wild griffin Aeries.&lt;/p&gt;" />
