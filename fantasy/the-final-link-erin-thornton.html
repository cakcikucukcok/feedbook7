  <title>The Final LInk - Erin Thornton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IS THERE ANYTHING STRANGER, THEN A GRANDMOTHER WHO DECORATES THE WALLS IN DOORKNOBS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If those doorknobs are really a gateway of doors that lead to other realms...then maybe. For centuries the Wasley women have guarded the gateway, and for those years the Guardians have been incomplete. When Aggie&amp;rsquo;s grandmother passed, the last things she expected was to be asked to join with eight hunky Guardians in order to help save a bunch of demon children who have been kidnapped. Through ever-changing storms and dangerous weather, they must figure out who is responsible and try and bring the children home in one piece. Too bad Aggie has to make a life-changing decision. Will she choose to accept her waiting powers by bonding with the Guardians or will she live the life of her ancestors and not fulfill her destiny?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; This is a reverse harem novel featuring many hot men, steamy sex and adult situations, magical creatures, demons, vampires, shifters, along with a woman who knows how to take charge of the situation, and so much more!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
