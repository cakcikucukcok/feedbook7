&lt;br /&gt;
The 30 Day Ketogenic Cleanse is the latest health book from Maria Emmerich. Emmerich has devoted her life to helping people regain their health and jump-start their weight loss by giving their bodies the right nutrients they need. The 30 Day Ketogenic Cleanse is designed for those who have tried the ketogenic diet in the past and fell off and those who are new to the ketogenic diet. The aim of the ketogenic diet found in this book is not to starve people but rather to help people navigate the first 30 days of starting the ketogenic diet, which is often the most difficult. The 30-Day Ketogenic Cleanse includes information on how inflammation, and the foods that cause it, causes diseases, among other information on why this diet is the most beneficial. Emmerich has also included a meal plan for the entire 30 days and recipes that go along with that meal plan.&lt;br /&gt;
The 30 Day Ketogenic Cleanse has been a top 100 seller in Amazon&amp;#39;s Diets and Ketogenic categories. The book has been rated 4 out of 5 stars on Goodreads, 4.5 stars out of 5 on Amazon, and 5 out of 5 stars on Barnes &amp;amp; Noble.&lt;br /&gt;
