  <title>Forest of the Dragon: Maiden to the Dragon, Book 9 (Dragon Shifter Romance) - Mac Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gods still roam the world, and it&amp;rsquo;s up to Miriam Cait, her lover dragon Xander, and their friends to stop them before the joined worlds are destroyed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Problems closer to home, however, need their attention. A summons brings them back to Viridi Silva, the woods along the southern border of Xander&amp;rsquo;s lands. There they find themselves thrust between two opposing sides, each laying claim to the forest. A truce seems impossible until a threat greater than both sides arises from within their own ranks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A shaky trust is formed against their common foe, but old hatreds threaten to destroy the fragile truce as Miriam and company must perform a battle of wits as well as power as they fight not only for control of the forest, but for the lives of their friends, as well." />
