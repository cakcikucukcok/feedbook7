  <title>Samael’S Cup - Kerry Lee Sutherland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Keira couldnt believe that an evening of surfing could change her life forever. One beautiful, summer twilight she was found by Theo, who bites her, takes her blood and gives her his in return. She thinks she is now a vampire but is soon to find out that the situation is a lot more complicated than that. Ten long years later, she is drawn into a crusade that crosses not just the planet, but time itself. Theo has been known by many other names in the past, names made famous through history and mythology. The goal? To destroy the Ancient enemy, Samael, his genetic manipulations and the devilish plan he began in long, lost Atlantis. While striving to bring the pieces of the quest together, Theo reveals his past to Keira, and the truth that she is the one he has been waiting for through all these long years.
Hate becomes love, enemies become friends and the fate of the world lay in the hands of a broken, hurting woman." />
