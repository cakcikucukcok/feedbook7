  <title>Each Separate Dying Ember - Tatiana A.S. Webb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a world where humanity bear wings and racial tension divides a city, things are... Complicated. Daneel just wants her family safe but was never meant to be the one protecting them; Jedekiah is busy trying to burn out the voices in his head while his home is falling apart; and North isn&#39;t even sure what&#39;s happening, but he&#39;s pretty certain it won&#39;t end in diplomacy. But after an unfortunate &quot;accident&quot; throws these three unlikely - and unwilling - allies out of their comfort zones and into each others&#39; worlds, they are going to have to learn very quickly the meaning of teamwork and cooperation, to ensure their survival through the city&#39;s notorious Disciplines, a (usually) optional gladatorial tournament. Victory will involve breaking boundaries, breaking bones, and occasionally breaking North&#39;s glasses - but the stakes might be higher than any of them realise. It&#39;s more than just their wings that they&#39;re fighting for." />
