  <title>The Balance - J. Steven Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Land of Fantasy and Elemental Magic is falling into chaos from Ancient Sumerian interference.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When Chaos took his twin sister at birth, Shuran was secreted away to grow abnormally fast in the powers of Essence. With the help of a motley crew of magic users, he begins a journey that takes him across the realms of Aurderia in a search for answers to his visions and the location of his missing father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
During his quest of adventure, Shuran will gain allies among the seven races of man, some more easily than others for there are old feelings of betrayal from other races such as the Elves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shuran&amp;#39;s predecessor to the title Shin&amp;#39;Ar, abandoned the realms and left them without a &amp;quot;Watcher of the Lands&amp;quot;. Now it is up to Shuran to rebuild the ancient troop of magic users to help restore balance to the Essence of Ersetu while fighting the darkness that lurks in Shadow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The balance between good and evil is a perilous thing. This is especially true for the world of Ersetu. Chaos has begun to manifest upon the lands threatening to tear the world apart again. Three children of seven elemental magic bloodlines are born to be instruments of change in the balance, but their roles are each different in this fantasy quest series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Follow along on the journeys of Shuran and his friends as they seek a means to triumph against dark forces and rally the world against the Chaos. The first book in the series will see the rebirth of an old force for good while old enemies begin to return. The series blends fantasy and science fiction with some Sumerian mythology while adding a twist on the magic of dragons.&lt;/p&gt;" />
