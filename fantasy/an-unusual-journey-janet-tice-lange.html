  <title>An Unusual Journey - Janet Tice Lange</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A group of 8 children, siblings and cousins, a few in their early teens experience many adventures as they travel across the United State in a very unique vehicle. New York City provides excitement as the children manage to antagonize a ferocious street gang resulting in police chases and narrow escapes. The youngsters also spend time searching for and finally finding a heirloom ring which theyve learned has been hidden by a relative in one of the Indian exhibits at the Museum of Natural History. As a result, they arouse the suspicion of the security guards who spy on the youngsters and finally send them fleeing. Mishaps occur in other states as well and as they travel these children learn about and thus become interested in various cultures. They even discover what it would be like to live in an apartment house in a large city. The children are inspired by the beauty and natural wonders of our world and so one writes poetry, and others paint pictures of the locations that have impressed them the most. Touring historical sites spikes their interests in history and geography. So some pursue their studies and help encourage the others do so as well. Because of their concern for others these youngsters help a number of people that they meet while on their journey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
