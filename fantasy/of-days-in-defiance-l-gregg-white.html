  <title>Of Days in Defiance - L. Gregg White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jake Wallace does not recognize America anymore. What society once vilified is now glorified as governmental politics change. For years he has watched the mainstream media gloss over domestic and world events with half truths, misinformation, or outright lies. He confides in Cara Jannsen, a friend and co-worker but she is resistant, believing that cant happen here. Can he convince her of the truth without driving her away? 
One day they witness an unnatural phenomenon that completely mystifies them. Later, Jake notices that no one is reporting on this strange phenomenon and he draws his own conclusion. There is a cover-up. How high does it go? 
Soon they see people changing. Riots ensue, plunging their town and county into chaos. Suddenly it hits him. The phenomenon is actually a catalyst for something more sinister. Quickly events escalate nationwide, creating even more unrest. As the two become closer, Jake and Cara quickly realize the need to escape the violence but something goes terribly wrong. 
So, begins their life changing journey of unbelievable highs and devastating lows, taking them across two states in the fight for their lives in a country that they do not recognize, running from a new autocracy in search of freedom, life and love." />
