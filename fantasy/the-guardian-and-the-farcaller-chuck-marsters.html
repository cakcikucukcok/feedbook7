  <title>The Guardian and the Farcaller - Chuck Marsters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book begins when Lee Kaaler returns home from a weekend vacation on the Oregon coast only to find his apartment has been ransacked.  He immediately calls the police, who discover there are no spoons in his apartment.  They also tell him the burglary appears to have been well planned and professionally done, implying the burglar and his or her bosses thought Lee had something of value.  He knows he owns nothing unusual for a bachelor, and certainly nothing valuable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A week later his parents home is also burgled with the same result: only spoons were taken and all other valuable possessions ignored.  When Lee tries to make sense of these events, he remembers that he in fact does own a spoon, a sterling silver spoon he inherited from his grandmother, but it is in his safety deposit box. The more he thinks about the spoon, the more he feels compelled to retrieve it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After doing so Lee takes it to his place and examines it carefully.  While looking at it, he notices the image of a ceiling fan can be seen in its bowl.  At first this surprises him; then it frightens him: there is no ceiling fan in his apartment!  Quite suddenly, the image of the ceiling fan is replaced by that of a man, a man who speaks with a strange accent and says that he has been trying to contact Lee for many years.  Even more distressing, he insists on referring to Lee as the Guardian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
SPOONWORLD: The Guardian and the FarCaller is the first of five books that tell of Lees discovery of the powers of that spoon and of a counterpart whose family has a long history of contact with previous Guardians  the last of which was Lees grandmother. As Lee strives to learn more about his heritage, he discovers he is being stalked by the Gerits, a family who learned of the Kaaler spoon through an accident that befell Lees great great uncle.  The Gerits already have a massive fortune, but want to use the spoons rumored powers of seeing into the future to add political and commercial power to their holdings.  This, the first SPOONWORLD novel, tells how Lee and FarCaller cooperate to harness their powers to battle the Gerits.  Surprising Lee even more, he learns FarCaller has enemies on his world  the world Lee calls Spoonworld.  Lee finds himself helping FarCaller fight against threats to his life. Failure for either man to protect the other could result in losing a war no one besides them and the Gerits know even exists but, with such a loss, disastrous consequences could befall this nation." />
