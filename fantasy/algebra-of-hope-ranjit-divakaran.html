  <title>Algebra of Hope - Ranjit Divakaran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a tale which has been waiting to be told. The story of the Indian expat community in the Arab world. It is not always about wealth and happiness as is often dreamt at the beginning of the journey. It is not always about prosperity and comfort as is believed by the society back home. It&#39;s also about sacrifice and pain, of frustrations and confusions. &lt;strong&gt;Algebra of Hope&lt;/strong&gt; tells the story of Indian expats through the eyes of Rakesh, a doctor who takes a job in Riyadh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the social and family fabric that we live in, the obligatory fibers are plentiful. However, for ill-defined reasons an Indian expat has been told that he should strip the obligation to himself. He does this proudly in the giving years and gets intoxicated by the tag of a giver. Grey hair and wrinkled face later on tells him, Why did you not look after yourself? Regret takes over hope as his best years have already been surrendered. Why should his sweat always be some ones balm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for some that tangle had to be ripped off at the right time..!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst the frustration and despair that so often characterize the expatriate&#39;s existence, there is also the uplifting story of determination, of fighting for what you believe is right, and of self-belief. And that is what this story too, is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Author &lt;strong&gt;Dr.Ranjit Divakaran&lt;/strong&gt;, a maxillofacial surgeon, is a native of Indian state of Kerala and has served in many gulf countries for almost fifteen years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
