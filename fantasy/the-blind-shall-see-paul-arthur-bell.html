  <title>The Blind Shall See - Paul Arthur Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE BLIND SHALL SEE
This adventure/fantasy is an intellectuals delight concerning a Queen of fairies and her civilization seeking aid from the village of Morbidity that has captured the picture perfect ideal of how to live with one another.  The vampire Honoree, and his brood that dwells in caves is tired of  feeding on animals, yet must renew every full moon with the town of Morbidity a pact that they will not feed on any villager and drink the dark water of the blood of the sacrifice of a bull to seal the agreement.  War looms on the outskirts of the village, that has known only peace, for their God Noram has betrayed them and the spirit of the trees they have relied on has becomes his lover.
Intellectual arguments surface between the fairy queen and the elder sanctified one as to the best way to live a moral life that is not ripe with suffering.  Power and ego surface as the dragon weeps tears for his army that they not go into battle against a race of perfect men, and the dragons god Amness pleads that the two armies surrender to one another before going into battle and surprisingly, they do.  What is revealed at the surrender is that in just about every little thing they hated one another for, they possessed as well.
The sanctified one reveals to the fairy queen, that only through surrender can a vision be realized, can reality be accurately witnessed, but to do this thing was often quite costly." />
