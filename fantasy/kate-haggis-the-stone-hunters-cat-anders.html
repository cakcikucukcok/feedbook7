  <title>Kate Haggis &amp; the Stone Hunters - Cat Anders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Snowfell, a pocketful of existence, within Earth&#39;s own. Where Kate Haggis, a simple bard, is telling the tale. Whilst working to gain enough coinage up to buy a passage to a far off place, where there is an enchantress, who might get Kate back to Earth.
However Kate&#39;s plans are about to go awry. 
For Leafeldur the magic user is hunting her down, to bring her back to him. Add to the fact, there is a sinister organization that is conspiring and is trying to win Kate over to their dark cause.
Unwittingly Kate is once again thrust into unwanted attention and being hunted. 
Kate comes up against both new and old enemies. Thrown into a chaotic battle, with even worse dangers than before. 
Forced to accept the inevitable, that sometimes, you have no choice with how life is going to be...
Assassins, sentient stones, and the stage is set; for terror and a little intuitive detective work from the bard. As Kate battles her own morals, in this latest tale, weaving her way through new perils.
Will Kate find a way out? 
Or will she be lost to her friends? 
Can Kate escape her destiny in this new madness?" />
