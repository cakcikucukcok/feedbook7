  <title>Death Incorporated: Death Touched, Book 2 (Urban Fantasy Romance) - Mac Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Death is only elusive when you search for him, and for Nena and her friends he&amp;#39;s a mystery wrapped in an enigma. His motives are unknown and his influence beyond their reach, but with the fate of the world on their shoulders they&amp;#39;re not lying down on the job. Fortunately, the information they gathered from Matt&amp;#39;s computer leads Nena and her new companions to one of the largest firms in the city, Rogue Rouge, Incorporated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A brief infiltration shows them they&amp;#39;re on the right track, but they&amp;#39;re going to need some insider help to get to the bottom of things. Fortunately, Nena knows someone on the inside, her father. The only problem is that once someone knows about the Agency they have to become a part of it, and there&amp;#39;s no exceptions for the living.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now Nena must make the choice to once more include her father in her life or keep him in the dark about her new existence. Either way Death is coming for them all, and when he comes it will mean the end of everything." />
