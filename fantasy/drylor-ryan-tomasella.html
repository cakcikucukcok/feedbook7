  <title>Drylor - Ryan Tomasella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a man wakes up inside a cage that is being carried through an underground city, he has no idea where he is or what has happened to him. As Von, a victim of amnesia, is taken to a jail cell to await his fate amongst elves, humans, dwarfs, gnomes, and halflings, he is told he is a member of the Royal Guard of Genisus. It is not long before he is transported to the palace where he meets an impatient king who eventually returns him to his jail cell while deciding his destiny.
As Vons memory slowly returns, he discovers that he is the only one who can protect Drylora world that abandoned himfrom its greatest evil, his own brother. Through his journey to the truth, Von meets an unlikely group of friends who are willing to sacrifice everything to help him stop his brother Scarlet from annihilating the only world they have ever known.
As Vons past becomes clear and reveals his future, he soon realizes the only way he can end his brother&#39;s heartless massacres is to find him and kill him." />
