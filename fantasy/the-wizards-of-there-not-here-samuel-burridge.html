  <title>The Wizards of There-Not-Here - Samuel Burridge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Wizards of There-not-Here is a fantasy creation story about four colourful wizards who are sent to make an empty world more colourful. Each wizard has a job to do and something different to add to the world. The story follows each wizard as he helps to create the mountains and valleys, rivers and oceans, plants and forests and the sun, moon and stars. The wizards are happy with the jobs they have done and the world they have helped create so they leave it to live and grow. 
As a primary school teacher I have spent a lot of time reading childrens books and telling stories in order to inspire the children I teach. With that in mind I have written a story which incorporates rhyme and simple narrative with a repetitive structure which can also be used in an educational setting across the curriculum. This is suitable for children of all ages as well as fans of the popular fantasy fiction genre to read to their children or grandchildren.
