  <title>Aim - Skye Lotus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s pointless to say what Zara has done - because she hasn&amp;#39;t done much. She&amp;#39;s lived in her house, all her life, never been let outside by her father, ever. But Zara is sick of being hidden away from the world she sees from her bedroom window. Until she steps outside that is, and the illusion is broken. Zara lives amongst the Gods - as a Goddess herself. Her heritage is not what it seems, and injustice, misunderstandings and a lack of empathy suffocate her in this new world. Surrounded by giants, thousands of years old, Zara finds herself in a predicament - whether the King of the Gods will let her live or die. But the King of the Gods is about to be knocked off his throne and murdered by his kin...and Zara is to blame. Suddenly she realises her terrible mistake and learns the difference between right and wrong, and the choices she must make to fix the problems she&amp;#39;s created. But not without consequences, twists and turns along the way. Aim is the first of two books telling a story through the eyes of a young girl who discovers she is destined to walk amongst the Greek Gods, using her own unique attributes to change the Kingdom for the better...or the worse. Unaware of her heritage and who she truly is, she must push past these obstacles to realise who she must become to solve the problems she has created. A fast paced book for readers aged 8 to 12, this will grab the attention of anyone who has a taste for mythology, mystery and questing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
