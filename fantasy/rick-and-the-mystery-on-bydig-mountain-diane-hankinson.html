  <title>Rick and the Mystery on Bydig Mountain - Diane Hankinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Being the oldest of five children always creates problems, especially when your father is a King. Taught to always obey the rules and to never use his magic except for chores, young Rick goes about his boring lifeuntil the day he discovers the books of Merlin in the castle library. As he begins reading, Rick knows he is breaking one of the Norkblens strictest laws. But Rick cannot stop himself as he ventures into the woods with a group of friends and begins practicing the old magic.
Rick soon discovers that an evil queen will stop at nothing to capture him, his friends, and ultimately destroy his father. Alone, hurt, and lost in the woods, he is surrounded by danger and the only way to survive is to use the forbidden magic. Now it is up to Rick, a human, two birds, and two Norkblens to rescue the villagers of Mouthyew and Tonplymbefore it is too late.
Up against an army of trained soldiers, coyotes, and a twisted queen, the odds seem insurmountable. But everyone knows that when it comes to magic, anything can happen." />
