  <title>The Wanderer&#39;s Tale - David Bilsborough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It has been five hundred years since the Peladanes stormed the distant stronghold of Vaagenfjord. There, the dreaded rawgr Drauglir and his supernatural minions had held sway over the mortal world, in a long, terrifying reign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now, the peace is broken. Rumors abound, ill omens have been seen, and a priest of the One God has had a vision. The rawgr--hideous, powerful creatures of which there were but few -- have reappeared and, from their far northern outpost, threaten to wreak vengeance on the descendants of the Peladanes who sacked their fortress centuries before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus begins an epic adventure--a fabulous quest--the likes of which has never been told. David Bilsborough, a brilliant young author, has created a passionately imagined vision of Lyndormyn, a world teeming with peoples, history, cultures; a world rich with fabulous landscapes and hidden terrors; a world with compelling characters--human and &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt;--some deadly, others merely remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sum, his creation explores a world of wonders that will surprise and captivate readers with its masterfully woven tapestry of lives entrapped by the play of Time and Chance, Good and Evil, on a grand scale. It&#39;s a sweeping epic to fire the imagination of readers everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
