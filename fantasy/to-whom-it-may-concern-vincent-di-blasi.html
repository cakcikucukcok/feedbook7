  <title>To Whom It May Concern - Vincent Di Blasi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The nine stories in this volume are each unique unto themselves but they all straddle the line between what we know and what we do not know, the material world and the spiritual one, what we hope for and what we fear most. The emphasis is on hope and our search for what is most beautiful within our world and within ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sarafina&lt;/em&gt; is about a man who must choose between heaven and hell. You might think the choice is an easy one until you appreciate the consequences. &lt;em&gt;In A String of Bad Hands&lt;/em&gt;, a writer plays poker with the devil to save the soul of a woman he met in the Yucatan in their distant youth. Before the game is over, he will risk everything he has in the hope of winning everything he wants. &lt;em&gt;From the Mirror&lt;/em&gt; is the narrative of a man who crosses the country looking for the other person we see in the mirror, the one we could have become or perhaps will be in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the title entry, &lt;em&gt;To Whom It May Concern&lt;/em&gt;, the inhabitants of a small island community discover that their world is sinking beneath the sea just as communication with the outside world comes to a halt. They never lose hope. These stories are about human resilience and limitless curiosity." />
