  <title>The Scratch - Melissa F. McClain, Rev Barney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Nealys dream seemed far out of reach now. He had trained since he was a boy to someday become the youngest Billiards 8-Ball World Champion.  His obstacles started with the 4 years spent behind bars for a crime he did not commit.  Now he was free, but was it too late to compete?  After all he hadnt been near a pool table in a long while.  He realized that he was bound to be rusty.  He did not realize all the unexpected obstacles that awaited him out in the free world.  Would he allow these obstacles to stand in the way of his dream becoming reality?  God had a calling on his life, which he was also unaware of.  Would he surrender to the Lord and give Him the glory for any victory he might enjoy?  Or would he resist and seek worldly fame and fortune? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Christian novel was written as an exhortation to bring those seeking a better way closer to the Lord. It combines action adventure and romance with a soft spiritual encouragement for the lost or those just looking for a good read. Dont be surprised if you read it more than once. Readers of all walks of life will enjoy this reading.&lt;/p&gt;" />
