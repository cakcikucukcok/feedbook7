  <title>Pastimes of the Unseen - Dean Vyas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are forces around us, good and evil, that have total involvement in our lives, and yet we have no knowledge of them.
These forces, from a realm of spirit, are helping or damning us, simultaneously.
From the present day to far into the future, the line of the Priest family, from generation to generation, are siding with the forces of good. But what will be the outcome of this allegiance with these forces? Will their beliefs and actions be futile or efficacious in the greater scheme of things?
Similarly, the progress of humanity is splitsome venerating the benevolent forces, while a faction veers away into the hands of those evil. And these two aspects of the human race are in conflict; the Priests, therefore, are also embroiled. Wars result, and consequentially a renegade portion of humanity becomes a breed of cold monsters, half machine. They enact a final war 
But who will emerge triumphant?
Whose philosophy is right, whose is wrong? And what to speak of the far reaching consequences for the spirit of these antagonistic facets of humanity?
The humble Priests find themselves implicated; they are to play a vital role in the evolution of humanity and an oppressed race enslaved by the cyborgs, where interstellar space travel, the terraforming of planets, and extreme genetic engineering become possible, where events of Biblical magnitude take place. 
Pastimes of the Unseen is a story describing those forces around us, invisible, that are vying for our very body, and soul, wanting to destroy it or glorify it, and the consequence of our relationship to one or other of these forces." />
