  <title>Fourth Fight: Sweet &amp; Sour, Book 4 - Mac Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Spring has sprung in Apple Hollow, and our werewolf couple Trixie and Orion are invited to a Blessing of the Tree where a new shifter will be born. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, the ceremony doesn&amp;rsquo;t go as planned and it&amp;rsquo;s discovered that someone has attacked the Tree, the very center of the hollow and all that keeps it safe. &amp;nbsp;Our heroes are approached by the caretaker of the Tree, Sage, and entrusted with the task of finding the culprit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trixie is reluctant to take on this new mission. &amp;nbsp;Something doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel right, and it isn&amp;rsquo;t the mold in the air giving her allergies. &amp;nbsp;She finds herself in the role of diplomat as the whole of the hollow begins to turn against Sage, Mab, and others following rumors of secret powers behind the peace in the valley. &amp;nbsp;A murder attempt and a successful murder lead them down a road of uncertain fate as they race against time, and Trixie&amp;rsquo;s better judgment, to a final finish that will decide more than just the life of the Tree, but her own reason for existing." />
