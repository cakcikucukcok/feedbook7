&lt;p&gt;On the morning of her 50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday, Ella Malone is shocked to receive one of several supernatural &quot;Gifts&quot; brought on by &quot;The Change.&quot; This isn&#39;t your typical &quot;change.&quot; This is Mega Menopause, and Ella&#39;s symptoms, or &quot;Gifts&quot;, become her superpowers! Suddenly, Ella is thrust into an amazing adventure full of discovery, danger, and a whole lotta humor!&lt;/p&gt;
