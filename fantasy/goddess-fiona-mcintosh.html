Zaradine Ana has been captured by the mysterious Arafanz and his desert warriors and is being held in their isolated fort.

Afflicted with the drezden illness that befalls him when he is weak, he is too sick to move from his bed, when help comes from an unexpected source . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zar Boaz finds himself trapped by both his heart and his head. Though he can think of nothing but Ana, imprisoned in the desert, his country is on the brink of war and his Spur is helpless.
