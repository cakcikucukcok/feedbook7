  <title>Joyous Universe: the Beings of Volkana. - Syed Abid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="65 million years ago during an apocalyptic shift in geography  a combination of meteor explosions rocked the Earth. Tumultuous cataclysm brought spurt growths of volcanic activities and the remaining life forms that lived, moved to the grounds below to remain there for the rest of history. Evolution has taken its course and during 1775 BC we have a chance encounter with these species. 
The Egyptians, Babylonians and Greeks lurk the waters of the Mediterranean where the island has mysteriously appeared with its inhabitants and an active volcanic peak. What happens when mythos meets real myth? And what if the worlds below are unleashed? 
Evolution doesnt stay stagnant if it is absent from our sight. Just like the many hidden caves, jungle canopies, the worlds below are the sensations that are brought in The Beings of Volkana. Full of seismic tensions  the people of the surface meet people of the worlds below in an unprecedented event in history  that would mark a new mythology in this era. Forever to be carved in the temples of the greatest of civilizations. 
The Beings of Volkana is part of the Joyous Universe series." />
