  <title>Born of Vengeance - Sherrilyn Kenyon</title>

Made Ravin by The League, he is now a target for their assassins-in-training to hunt and kill. The average life expectancy for such beings is six weeks. But defying the odds is what this Gyron Force officer does best, and Bastien won&#39;t rest until he lays his betrayers in their graves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ten years later, he has one chance to balance the scales of justice, provided he relies on his former wingman-- the very sister of the woman who testified against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Major Ember Wyldestarrin joined the outlaw Tavali the day Kirovar fell into the hands of a tyrant, and she and her sister-team were left on an outpost to die under the barrage of enemy fire. The last thing she wants is to be involved in politics again. But the one thing she wants more than anything is revenge on the tyrant who murdered her parents and forced her and her sisters into exile. Carrying a secret she knows Bastien will annihilate her over, she must find some way to trust her former wingman before he catches on and kills her. Even so, treachery doesn&#39;t come easy to a woman who took a loyalty oath to protect her homeworld and comrades-in-arms, especially when Bastien is much more to her than just a former wingman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet as she tries to do right for her family, she learns that Bastien doesn&#39;t just hold the key to the fate of Kirovar, he is vital to The Sentella-League war, and to The Tavali. If she doesn&#39;t ensure he survives this mission, three nations fall, and time for all of them is quickly running out.&lt;/p&gt;" />
