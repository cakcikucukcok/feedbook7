  <title>The Warrior of Elyon - Aaron W. Baldwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kenneth Tudyk is the high counselor and closest friend of Ethan Lyons, the king of Eden. His world is turned upside down when the king mysteriously disappears and his expectant wife is kidnapped. In order to find those he lost, Kenneth joins forces with some old friends and elves with a fearsome reputation that he believes may have been involved with both disappearances. If he is to save his friend and his family, he must learn to trust those he believes are not worthy of trust and more importantly put his faith in the god Elyon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Benniah wakes up on the shore of a volcanic island with no memory of who he is or how he arrived on the island. He is taken in by an old hermit and begins to learn the teachings of Elyon including the ways of Elyons legendary warriors called to stand against injustice and fight evil. After he and his new mentor are exiled from the island by a power-hungry chieftain, Benniah finds himself standing up against a tyrant king to save innocent people from a lifetime of cruel oppression.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both Kenneth and Benniah are soon drawn into a struggle against men intent on harnessing the power of ultimate evil in order to enslave every living soul. It will take all of their skill and faith to prevail, and a warrior, a warrior of Elyon." />
