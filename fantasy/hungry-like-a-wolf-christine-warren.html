  <title>Hungry Like a Wolf - Christine Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HUNGRY LIKE A WOLF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Christine Warren&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her father died, Honor Tate inherited the alpha position for a pack of werewolves based in New England. But why her? Honor would have rather just lived a &quot;normal&quot; life, with the occasional run through the woods in her furry suit. Still, Honor was raised to put the welfare of the pack first...and now it&#39;s time to make a formal request that the alpha of the Silverback clan--the pack to which all locals owe fealty--recognize her as alpha of the White Paw. But instead of sending his support, the Silverbacks send Logan Hunter.&lt;br&gt;Logan Hunter would do anything to protect the Silverbacks--but his devotion comes with a price. For years he has been fighting his alpha instincts and the need for his own pack. But all that changes when Logan is sent on a mission to find out whether the new White Paw alpha really has what it takes to carry on her father&#39;s legacy. Powerful, spirited, and downright gorgeous Honor exceeds his expectations...and leaves him howling for more. Could it be that he&#39;s finally found his alpha mate? Or will old enemies, dueling loyalties, and an appetite for destruction stop him dead in his tracks?&lt;/p&gt;" />
