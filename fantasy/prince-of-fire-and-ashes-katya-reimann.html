  <title>Prince of Fire and Ashes - Katya Reimann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Magic, gods, and history build to a stunning climax in Katya Reimann&#39;s Tielmaran Chronicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tielmark&#39;s free prince sits imperiled by the relentless conspiracies of the neighboring Bissanty Empire. Sorceress Gaultry Blas, blessed by Tielmaran&#39;s goddess-twins, returns to her homeland yearning for peace, but instead discovers a conspiracy of evil magics. The coven of witches sworn to defend the prince&#39;s crown have gathered to attend the dying Duchess of Melaudiere, who protects their throne&#39;s unborn heir. They also have an unpleasant truth: In years past, the witches failed their oath to Tielmark. If they fail again, their lives and those of their descendants will be lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forest-born Gaultry, tuned more to action than politics, navigates tricky court intrigue and is determined to work with the Common Brood witches to break the ancient Bissanty claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Gaultry is stalked by a hidden Tielmaran-born enemy who is bent on shattering Bissanty chains at any cost. This enemy has waited fifty years for the alignment of the stars that will allow Tielmark&#39;s prince ascent to a kingly throne. She will not let Gaultry get in her way-for this enemy has been planning from before Gaultry&#39;s birth how to stop her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the intricate infighting of Tielmark&#39;s court to the barren sun-bleached battlegrounds at Tielmark&#39;s farthest border, Gaultry must call on her magic, courage, and spirit to overcome the obstacles to her realm&#39;s rightful kingship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the great treachery is finally exposed in a brutal endgame played out under Tielmark&#39;s towering border mountains, Gaultry and members of the Common Brood will call upon their deepest powers to crown a king-or kill the hopes of their kingless realm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
