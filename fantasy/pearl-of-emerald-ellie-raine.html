The Land realm is on the brink of a civil war as rumors of their lost Relicblood&amp;rsquo;s imminent return continue to spread. The war between the realms is threatening the fragile balance of this world as even the Demon kingdoms are fighting amongst themselves. Caught in the middle are twin reapers who have fallen into this dark adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six years trapped inside his twin, Xavier&amp;rsquo;s soul is finally back in his own body, although his long years in a soulless coma has left him physically weak. Death Princess Willow is thrilled to have her fianc&amp;eacute; back, but her duties as Grim&amp;rsquo;s emissary takes precedence now that the Reaper&amp;rsquo;s war with Everland has intensified. The twins sail with Willow on a diplomatic mission to the icy glaciers of the Ocean realm before continuing on to the lush forests of the Neverland continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the ruthless new queen has laid an ominous trap for the legendary Shadowbloods, and the reapers are sailing right into it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
