  <title>The Strange Treasures of Gramma Zulov: The Sibylline Books - Alex Ross Carol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a young boy, Willie, finds a series of strange, old books in the attic of his great-grandmother&#39;s house, things go from curious to terrifying. Soon, he embroils his entire family in a dark, menacing world where the magic of the books is sought for riches and power.   Born from the ruins of ancient Greece and the Oracle at Delphi two thousand years earlier, the books have a mystical past and even more mysterious future. Willie, his mother Raya, and his older brother, Daniel, begin a hunt for the secrets behind the books after Daniel&#39;s life is suddenly threatened. Unfortunately, the answers they find lead them on a journey into the heights and depths of the power brokers in Washington, D.C. and the politicians who occupy the offices. The year is 2028, and it&#39;s an election year. Some in that town are willing to do anything to get their hands on books that foretell the future - even kill for them." />
