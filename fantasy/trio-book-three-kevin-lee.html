  <title>Trio: Book Three - Kevin Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if someone came along and offered you a chance to take the road less traveled?  A chance to live a dream?  
     That was the case for Neil Baxter, Zach Thomas and Tony Merello in TRIO Book One.  A strange man showed up one day and offered them exactly that, a chance to help and begin anew on a strange world where magic thrives and all creatures of myth and magic do exist.  
     The adventure continues in Book Three Ascension as Neil, now crowned King with Tasha as his Queen has begun a new era of the monarchy on the world of Avalon.  In the six months that have passed since the destruction of the Dark Dragon they are making every effort to bring the races of the world together.  
     The wizard Malcolm, while investigating regions in the south, discovers an abominable evil on the verge of escape and after his return to Kildare Castle an old nemesis re-emerges with a legion of demons at her command and threatens to conquer not only Avalon but to cross over to the old world and annihilate all who refuse to bow down to her.  
      The Trio is once again separated to fulfill different quests to fend off the approaching demon storm bent on destroying everything in their path in their desire to subjugate the world of Avalon.  All the races join forces against the oppression of a witch gone mad and all the powers of darkness at her disposal.  Amidst it all, a mythical wizard of lore and bedtime stories joins in the battle to save not only one world but two!
  New alliances are forged, legends become reality, and destinies will be determined.  All will not be as it was before.
The War of Magics is about to commence." />
