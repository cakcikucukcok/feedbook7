  <title>The Voices Down Under - William L Stolley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A crime baffles the Australian police a young woman washed ashore with unexplainable injuries as a cause for death. Her birth certificate lists Rollo, Kansas  a town that no longer exists  as her place of origin. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well? the head of security asks. What do you think we should do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one conclusion to draw, Han commented after they reviewed the report. Dont you agree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master Li feared Hans overwhelming logical conclusion, one that threatens to bring down the newly formed World Psychic Organization  a  rogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and not just any rogue, Han continued when Li did not respond, a serial killer with advanced psychic ability. Since he has evaded Master Lis detection, who knows where or when he will strike next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li took in a deep breath and pushed his plate of Running Elks delicacies away. He lost his appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hes ruthless, Han commented. You wont be able to stop him as you did the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, Master Li said as he rose and walked to the window.  A dark cloud has descended over us, Han. This rogue represents the kind of  threat weve always dreaded, he said as he gazed out at the cold February  landscape. Psychic pitted against psychic in a duel to the death&lt;/p&gt;
