  <title>True Heart - Ruby Nari Mayo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The legend began long ago, when the Earth was young. Even before the coming of men, advanced spirits were asked by Mother Earth to serve as guardians for the planet. Many answered, but four agreed to combine their powers to protect the northwest lands called Sacred Valleys. Throughout the millennia, many spirits left the earth, but few remained to protect all who dwelled beneath the splendor of Thunder Mountain. And so the legend of the Thunder Gods continues.
In the sequel to &lt;i&gt;The Catalysts,&lt;/i&gt; the Gods are summoned to protect once more. Through a tragic accident, three children are left orphaned. As Mike and Joe Kelly, with baby sister Carli in tow, trudge along a road to their grandfathers ranch, they soon learn from his neighborsthe Strongbowsthat their grandfather has died. After the Strongbows become their guardians, the children strive to regain a sense of security, heal their grief, and adjust to living in a strange house. Even so, although the Kelly children dont yet know it, the Thunder Gods have selected them to serve as catalysts for change.
But when tragedy strikes again, it is up to the Thunder Gods to save a young boybefore it is too late." />
