  <title>Happy Days - N.D. Mellen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The apocalypse has come and gone. The dead are walking the earth. Humanity is down to its few surviving members, eeking out a primitive existence behind the fortified walls of a compound in the middle of a desert wasteland. Law and government are dead- just like most of the people- leaving a morally grey code of conduct in their place. 
And I couldnt be happier.
See, Ive had urges my entire life; urges that would have eventually had me strapped into an electric chair if polite society had stayed the same. Sometimes I could control my needs; sometimes not. But now - in this broken America- Im an Exterminator. My job is to seek out any threat and put it down, and damn it, I love my work. But twenty-four hours can change everything, and a morally grey code of conduct can turn black just as quickly. Thats when you find out who you really are, and what youre actually capable of doing.
Welcome to Branberry Street; were the little cul-de-sac at the end of the world.
Dexter meets Zombieland. A must read for lovers of the zombie genre.
