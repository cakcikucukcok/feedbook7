  <title>Foolish Kings - Lael Silver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="...they disappeared into the dark mist and searing water. Just simple as that, they were on Earth no longer... 
Over a year and a half later, Ellyora finds herself seeking the myth world of Alora once again. With her little brother kidnapped by monsters, and God calling her name, she is lost in that far away land that still misses its king. When a stranger named Laythe Alban comes along, she doesnt know if he is an Angel of God or a Demon from Hell, and that makes things all the more surreal. 
Zage Royal is rebuilding his life around the only two people in the world that seem to care about him: Flaren and Blythe, who are trying to start a life together. But when someone attacks their home and sends them running, they call upon an old friend. 
Malachi Raziel is beaten, bloody, and broken beyond repair: Dying in all sense of the word. An old adversary from his past is back, and tearing open old scars. In Malachis darkest hour, only one thing seems to be his hope. But the problem is that he cant decide if shell be the cause of his salvation or damnation. 
Bringing back your favorite heroes and heroines, bringing in your worst nightmares, and bringing forth characters that may be one or the other. Foolish Kings, the second installment of the Missing King Chronicles will keep you wanting more, and draw you back into Alora yet again." />
