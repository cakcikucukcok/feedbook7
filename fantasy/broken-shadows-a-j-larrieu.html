  <title>Broken Shadows - A.J. Larrieu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;Everyone has a breaking point.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Mina Tanner was once a converter, a human with telekinetic and telepathic abilities. After a vicious mental assault by an evil shadowmind stripped her of her powers, she was forced to flee her home to escape her attacker. Now, she&#39;s trying to start a new life in San Francisco, far away from any and all reminders of the gifts she grew up using.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;But her precariously balanced &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; life topples as her apartment and her job fall victim to a new luxury development. Jackson Herring, an old family friend and powerful converter, offers Mina his spare bedroom while she gets on her feet, and she agrees&amp;#8230;reluctantly. Mina&#39;s finding it difficult enough to adjust without a daily reminder of what she&#39;s lost, especially when that reminder is six-foot-four, super-talented and gorgeous.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;When a mugger attacks her and she somehow burns his hands, Mina realizes that despite everything she&#39;s lost, she may have gained something far more powerful&amp;#8212;and dangerous&amp;#8212;than she ever imagined. And when the rest of the shadowmind community learns about it, Mina will find herself on the run once again.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Book three of The Shadowminds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;93,000 words" />
