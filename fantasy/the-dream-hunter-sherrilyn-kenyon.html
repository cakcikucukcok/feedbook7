  <title>The Dream-Hunter - Sherrilyn Kenyon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the ethereal world of dreams, there are champions who fight to protect the dreamer and there are demons who prey on them... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arik is such a predator. Condemned by the gods to live eternity without emotions, Arik can only feel when he&#39;s in the dreams of others. For thousands of years, he&#39;s drifted through the human unconscious, searching for sensation. Now he&#39;s finally found a dreamer whose vivid mind can fill his emptiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Megeara Kafieri watched her father ruin himself and his reputation as he searched to prove Atlantis was real. Her deathbed promise to him to salvage his reputation has now brought her to Greece where she intends to prove once and for all that the fabled island is right where her father said it was. But frustration and bad luck dog her every step. Especially the day they find a stranger floating in the sea. His is a face she&#39;s seen many times.... in her dreams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What she doesn&#39;t know is that Arik holds more than the ancient secrets that can help her find the mythical isle of Atlantis. He has made a pact with the god Hades: In exchange for two weeks as a mortal man, he must return to Olympus with a human soul. Megeara&#39;s soul. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a secret society out to ruin her expedition, and mysterious accidents that keep threatening her life, Megeara refuses to quit. She knows she&#39;s getting closer to Atlantis and as she does, she stumbles onto the truth of what Arik really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Arik his quest is no longer simple. No human can know of a Dream-Hunter&#39;s existence. His dream of being mortal has quickly turned into his own nightmare and the only way to save himself will be to sacrifice the very thing he wanted to be human for. The only question is, will he?&lt;/p&gt;" />
