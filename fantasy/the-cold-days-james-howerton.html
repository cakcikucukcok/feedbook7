  <title>The Cold Days - James Howerton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I will die up here in the high mountains, she thought. And be like Solanda, Mothers old friend, who vanished as the deer vanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A demon tricked me by looking like a boy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You climb too high, the hunter said, squatting down on his haunches and leaning against a boulder. Nothing eat up here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mira finally got her voice: Why are you here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I follow you. He smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mira stared down the great mountain, knowing she was trapped, that she had climbed too high where monsters are. He had stalked her like a deer. And she had been as foolish as a deer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To kill me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave her a surprised, then puzzled look. Why I want to kill you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give the gods their sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked at her for a long time, and Mira felt strange. He was handsome, his hair and beard night-black, his blue eyes arrogant, confident. A smile that was very close to a smirk. He was a savage-looking boy, but she saw that he was a boy, not two seasons older than her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His deerskin leggings were well-used and torn ragged, made by skillful hands, but not any of the river tribes. Slung over his back was a very ornate spear thrower. A brace of feathered arrows in a wolfskin pouch flared out of his back. His right fist gripped a long spear crowned with a tooth of flint. Rawhide thongs belted his leggings; on his waistbelt a stone hatchet and long stone knife were strapped. His arms and legs rippled with savage muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mira clutched her little pointed stick. She edged down the mountain slope, to see what he would do. Why did you follow me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a shadow now, against the boulder, but she could see his white teeth grinning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are very pretty, he called out of the evening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didnt follow her. He wasnt going to hurt her. She scuttered down the slope, grinning now, heart pounding and sudden blood in her face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he said to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You climb too high, Pretty One! his voice echoed behind her, making a crazy thrill in her stomach. Run home before it gets dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her face burned red. Why! she called, grinning over her shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because a knife-tooth has come to this mountain.&lt;/p&gt;" />
