  <title>Star Seed Trilogy - Alliena Cavazos, Krista Cordova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Star Seed Trilogy is based in the far future from our current time. In the start of the first book, humans live in floating cities since the surface of the earth is nothing but dried dirt. There are no plants or water on the surface. The animals present on the surface are large and mutated. A solar flare that happened in 2020 (using a date since we never placed one in the book) 5038 is the current time for the book. The government rules over the people. 
Some work in sanctuaries, where the plants that were saved are held to keep them growing and alive to keep oxygen in the atmosphere. Kaiya and Kouji, the twin sound elementals, want to find a flower called Star Seed to get their bodies back, which are rattled with dieses. They go on this journey to find the Star Seed and encounter a species called Guardians, which are the giant animals that help them through the book. But they also encounter the giant mutated animals on the surface where their lives are put in danger. 
As the creatures and elementals fight for their lives on this journey, they also must fight with General Hughes from the government who is power -hungry. In the end, the world is returned to its true self of living life. There is a war that prolongs through the end of the book but does end. There is a lot of bloodshed through the book, some for the greater good, and some for greed. Which side will win and rise to continue with life, this is where you would read and find out on your journey with them." />
