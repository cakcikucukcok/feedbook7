  <title>Oliver and Harriet and the Dark Forest - P.R. Schoenfeld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Oliver and Harriet are a seemingly normal set of twins, living a
normal life, in our normal world, with one exception -- they are
not normal -- they have the strange ability to read each others&#39;
mind -- something they thought was perfectly normal. Oliver and Harriet
know nothing about other realms, strange creatures, magic potions, or evil
tyrants. Th at is until they turn thirteen and return to the realm where they
were born -- Framington, to stay at their Gam&#39;s house for the summer. Oliver
and Harriet quickly realize their summer journey would not be like anything
they have ever experienced before, and could be an experience they may not
survive. Framington is a mythical place full of colorful hobbits, cranky ogres,
and fi re breathing dragons -- a place where their father once ruled and they
are decedents to the throne. Framington is now ruled by an evil tyrant -- Lord
Th ornas. Th ornas has been confi ned to the Dark Forest for years and the only
way out is for him to fi nd &quot;Th e Book&quot; -- a book which only Harriet has the
ability to use. Th ornas must fi nd a way to lure Oliver and Harriet to Albazar
castle to gain possession of &quot;Th e Book&quot;. If Lord Th ornas succeeds Oliver and
Harriet will surely not make it out of the Dark Forest alive." />
