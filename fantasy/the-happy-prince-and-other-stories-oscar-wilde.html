  <title>The Happy Prince and Other Stories -  Oscar Wilde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Happy Prince and Other Tales (sometimes called The Happy Prince and Other Stories) is a collection of stories for children.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It contains five stories, &amp;quot;The Happy Prince&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Nightingale and the Rose&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Selfish Giant&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Devoted Friend&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;The Remarkable Rocket&amp;quot;. It is most famous for its title story, &amp;quot;The Happy Prince&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the main story, a swallow meets the statue of the late &amp;quot;Happy Prince&amp;quot;, which houses the soul of the original prince, who in reality had never experienced true happiness. The statue inspires the swallow to selfless acts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oscar Wilde (1854&amp;ndash;1900) was an Irish writer and poet. After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of London&amp;#39;s most popular playwrights in the early 1890s. Today he is remembered for his epigrams, plays and the circumstances of his imprisonment, followed by his early death." />
