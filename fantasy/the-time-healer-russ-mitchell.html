  <title>The Time Healer - Russ Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the year 2024 an ailing eighty year old man stumbles upon the ability to Time-travel. During his first experience he is transported back to the year 1950 to the Pasture of a farm on the plains of Eastern Colorado. There he encounters a six year old boy who to the shock of both of them, discovers is himself as a child. The Old man soon realizes that he is being guided by an unknown entity. Not only has he been given the ability to Time-Travel he is also blessed with several abilities and powers. Foremost the ability to heal the most deserving of people. He uses these powers selflessly for the ultimate achievement of a very special quest, this quest being instigated due to a scientific discovery made by a young teenaged boy genius in the year 1960. Due to a certain element created as a side effect of the old mans Time-Travel, this young genius discovers a method for developing an Artificial Weather System inside a test tube.
In the year 2024 the planet is on the verge of an environmental meltdown. If Things cant be reversed; in another twenty years Mankind will cease to exist.
	The Quest therefore is to reverse the future decimation of the planet.
	During this quest he encounters a myriad of colorful characters, each with a heart felt story. Wanny, his passionate soul mate is always by his side, body and soul. Only time will tell what can or will be reversed" />
