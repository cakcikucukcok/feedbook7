  <title>The Ark of Pelor - Keith R. Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In an ancient time of magic and dragons, Sam leads a small group of teenagers that have been brought together by fate.  They must first fight for their own freedom.  They learn to trust one another as they are sent on a mission for a god, an epic quest of its own.  They must travel over land and sea and across the front lines of a war to fulfill their quest.  
Sam and his friends meet many on their journey; some who help them and others who seek their lives, and still others who need their help because no one else will.  Sam grows from an orphaned young teen to a quiet, confident leader of a small community.  
Throughout their quest, they must be ever vigilant for dangers around every corner, including traps, men and monsters that they had never heard of.  Plus they meet face to face with both a dragon and a vengeful god." />
