  <title>Out of Time - D. C. Claymore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Army of Darkness is waging a massive attack against the Warriors of the Light and civilian forces on Rylaxon. Young Warrior Biron Coomra has his hands full not only battling the enemy, but also fighting the critical energy crisis on Edathe only refuge from the evil spreading across the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to save humanity, Biron must protect his friend, Dalsia, in her mission to locate life-saving crystals that can keep Edas future alive. If any crystals exist, they are deep underground in a closed, flooded mine inside enemy territory. Unfortunately, a resentful Dalsia blames Biron for the death of the man she loved. But as Biron attempts to alleviate Dalsias tortured memories by traveling through time to change her past, he soon discovers that no good deed goes unpunished. His kind intentions turn tragic, threatening to negate the Lights greatest victory. Now it is up to Biron to ignore his Warrior code and restore the futureeven if that means killing the innocent and placing his own life in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this continuing battle of good versus evil, a young Warrior must repair a fractured timeline, find crucial power crystals, and save humanity before time erases all hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
