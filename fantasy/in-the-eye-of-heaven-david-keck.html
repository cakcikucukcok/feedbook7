  <title>In the Eye of Heaven - David Keck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From a strong new voice in epic fantasy comes the tale of Durand, a good squire trying to become a good knight in a harsh and unforgiving world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set to inherit the lordship of a small village in his father&#39;s duchy because the knight of that village has been bereaved of his own son, Durand must leave when the son unexpectedly turns up alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First he falls in with a band of knights working for a vicious son of a duke and ends up participating in the murder of the duke&#39;s adulterous wife. Fleeing, he comes into the service of a disgraced second son of a duke, Lamoric, who is executing a long subterfuge to try to restore his honor in the eyes of his father, family, and king. By entering tournaments anonymously as &quot;The Red Knight,&quot; Durand will demonstrate his heroism and prowess and be drafted into the honors of the king. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But conspiracies are afoot--dark plots that could break the oaths which bind the kingdom and the duchies together and keep the banished monsters at bay. It may fall to Durand to save the world of Man...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authentic and spellbinding,&lt;i&gt; In the Eye of Heaven&lt;/i&gt; weaves together the gritty authenticity of a Glen Cook with the high-medieval flair epitomized by Gene Wolfe&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Knight&lt;/i&gt;, to begin an epic multi-volume tale that will take the fantasy world by storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
