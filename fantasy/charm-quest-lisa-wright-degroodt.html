  <title>Charm Quest - Lisa Wright DeGroodt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Quests continue  &lt;/p&gt;
Sasha Vanden, a young woman with a tormented past, finds herself thrust into the interdimensional battle between Good and Evil. Traveling to the Land without a safety net, her allegiance is questioned from all corners of the World and Land as she is pursued by friends and foes alike. As the Tree transports her freely throughout the Land, Sasha is hunted by Good and Evil   and she questions which side of the alliance she belongs with.&lt;/p&gt;
During her travels, Sasha is befriended by mysterious men; one her enigmatic boss, the other a tragic loner with a darkly bleak past. Sasha&#39;s tragic history and personal heartbreak make trusting others a difficult task, and Sasha learns the ultimate sacrifice is often unavoidable. No matter what the personal cost." />
