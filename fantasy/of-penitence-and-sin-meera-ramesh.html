  <title>Of Penitence and Sin - Meera Ramesh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Peter has not had what youd call a normal life. Originally an angel from Gods own vanguard, he is blamed for a crime he did not commit and is cast from Heaven. Years later, he is approached by one of his own kind, another angel by the name of Elena. She brings with her an interesting proposal that has Peter and his four best, and only, friends on a wild chase across the continents. They encounter all manner of evils, from the Seven Deadly Sins to their mysterious benefactor, a person closer to Peter than he knows. He is haunted by a betrayal from his past, and by his own demons in the present. As love plants a seed in his heart, he finds that there are more sides to life, and his own soul, than he first expected. But with his return to Heaven hanging in the balance, will Peter be willing to give up his humanity in order to complete his mission and achieve his goal?" />
