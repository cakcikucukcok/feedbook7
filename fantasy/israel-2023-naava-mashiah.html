  <title>Israel 2023 - Naava Mashiah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="IsraEL 2023 is a near-future tour of Israel in the year 2023. The main character arrives to Israel for her nieces wedding in Jerusalem, which she has not visited in over a decade. She shares anecdotes and impressions of the country as she travels the land. She encounters characters whom explain to her the various changes which the country underwent, including demographic, more religious population majority, economic changes and upheavals, geopolitical changes of the neighborhood, and different bilateral relations with allies. 
We travel with the character as she traverses across the land of Israel as she visits places of her birth and nostalgic locales from the past: Hadera, Caeserea, Karmiel, Haifa, Jaffa, Herzliya, Dead Sea. She also visits new installations, like the MEGA Military Base in the south, and she visits with former Shimon Peres in his offices in Jaffa. The year 2023 coincides with the seventy-fifth anniversary of the state of Israel, and the country is celebrating this major anniversary in its own special type of parade.
IsraEL 2023 is a satirical depiction and humoristic fiction. The book is brief to allow the reader a bite-size taste of the satire and the publisher to implement the project in a timely manner close to the elections. It may resonate with the book Soumission by the French author Michel Houllebecq.
As the days of pivotal March 2015 election neared, leaving Israel at a historic crossroads, the news emerging from Israel left my manuscript closer to a prophecy rather than a satirical comedy. The book will be of interest not only to Israelis living in the country but also to the international Jewish Diaspora and readership in Arab countries curious about domestic developments in their neighboring country." />
