  <title>Norma Jeane&#39;s Wishes in Time - Stuart P. Coates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the year 2040, the United States no longer exists. Instead, it&#39;s a province of the former Soviet Union, which has been restored to its past glory. And each newborn child is assigned a Designation Number instead of a name.&lt;br&gt;
Now, forty years later, a man known only as 77241 escapes into the past in an effort to discover where the world went wrong. When 77241 comes upon footage of Norma Jeane Baker, known throughout the world as Marilyn Monroe, he becomes haunted by her face, so much so that he seeks out her gravesite and begins speaking to her hologram.&lt;br&gt;
As oxygen bombs fall upon the former United States in a final act of destruction, 77241 escapes in a time bubble traveling back to June 1960. Once there, he seeks out Norma Jeane at a movie set. Through her, he attempts to save John F. Kennedy from his all-too-early demise hoping to alter enough of the past to change the world&#39;s future destruction.&lt;br&gt;
Join 77241 and Norma Jeane as they interact with a cast of historical characters, including Kennedy, Mark Twain and Abraham Lincoln, as they seek to change the course of history in &lt;i&gt;Norma Jeane&#39;s Wishes in Time&lt;/i&gt;." />
