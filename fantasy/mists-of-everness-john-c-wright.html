  <title>Mists of Everness - John C. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Chronicles of Everness continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young Galen Waylock is the last watchman of the Dream Gate, beyond which the ancient evils wait, hungry for the human world. For a thousand years, Galen&#39;s family has stood guard, scorned by a world that dismissed the danger as myth. Even Galen&#39;s father deserted their post. Discarding his belief in the other world, he left Castle Everness and  the lonely coast of Maine to travel the world as a soldier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the warning bell has sounded in the dream world, unheeded. Now, the minions of Darkness have stirred in the deep and the long watch is over. An army of mythic monsters has invaded our world, and Galen and his friends have begun to fight them. To join the battle with universal darkness, even his father returns. The forces of light have gathered in Castle Everness, which must stand, or all is lost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Wright has been called the most important talent of the new century, and received  rave reviews for each volume of his debut SF trilogy, The Golden Age. Now, in &lt;i&gt;Mists of Everness &lt;/i&gt;he continues the towering fantasy begun in &lt;i&gt;The Last Guardian of Everness&lt;/i&gt;, a stirring epic that will inspire readers everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
