  <title>The Legend of Coren - Terry Lee Smith Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Coren, an immortal, has never truly known what she is, though her personal madness began in the psychological chains of enslavement to an ancient and evil spirit that called itself Kanthul in ancient times gone by. But Coren refused that to be the end of her story. Through a miracle, she was able to free herself and other immortals from bondage and trap her slave master once and for all. But with her new freedom, she and other immortals established themselves as gods to a weaker humanity, who in turn began worshipping them. But the immortals only knew brutality and exhibited that upon mankind. Humanity rose against their false gods as a new era began for them. Yet throughout the millennia that proceeded, Coren had to learn many things about humanitys place and her own among them, including love, hate, and revenge. Who she once thought she could trust betrayed her. The immortal Cassie stole more than two hundred years of her life. As she emerged from depravation, the world she once knew changed forever. Corens journey to find Cassie has shown her that another vile spirit from the immortals past is being manipulated by Cassie for her own agenda. Coren seeks a nomad named Lawson, who unknowingly is the key to facing Corens past and confronting a very real threat to both humanity and immortals alike." />
