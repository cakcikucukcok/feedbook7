  <title>Rock Haulter - Stephen Hayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The second instalment in the Magic Crystals series, immediately following the events of &amp;#39;The Seventh Sorcerer&amp;#39;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The original villain is back, only this time he is on a different mission, taking orders from the evil and cunning Hammerson Sorcerers, and his path will intersect those of John Playman and his friends on Rock Haulter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A desperate race must ensue, Moran and the powers of the Hammersons against the Chopville teens. The prize will be the most powerful of all the Magic Crystals and a control over the balance of life, but such extraordinary power is heavily protected. There is no guarantee that all will live to see the end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The danger faced this week will be greater than anything faced in &amp;#39;The Seventh Sorcerer&amp;#39;, but that won&amp;#39;t stop the teens from having a good time, as only teenagers can. But beneath all that, a far more serious situation is simmering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is only those closest to the Sorcerers who understand how delicate the peace between the Woodwards and Hammersons is, and how quickly that could change." />
