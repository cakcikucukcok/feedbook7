  <title>Cally and Missy, Three - M Missy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Well; I can sure say that my life did not turn out the way I expected. My life did not turn out how anyone would expect.
I never thought that I would commit a crime and get arrested, but I did.
I never thought that I would end up being a shemale sissy maid, but I did.
I never thought that I would fall in love with and marry a lesbian, but I did.
I never thought that I would live my life as a submissive to a dominate Lady, but I do.
I never thought that I would become an attorney and save the innocent from going to prison, but I have.
I never thought that I would be able to look at someone and ask a few questions and know what was wrong with them and save their life, but I have, several times.
I never thought that I would infiltrate the Russian Mob and save the lives of 39 young ladies, but I did.
I never thought that I would be in a position to help the FBI, Interpol and Lloyds of London solve kidnapping crimes, but I have.
I never thought that I would become a psychologist, but I have.
I never thought that I would marry a financial genus that would make me almost 50 million dollars in less than 4 years, but I did,
I never thought that my life would be so diverse and exciting in many different ways, but it is.
Just in the past 6 weeks alone;
I have saved the life of Molly, my mother in law,
I saved a family of 11 from needing to sell 10 of their kidneys just to survive,
I calmed the minds and hearts of Mindy, Toni, Sabrina, and Cally concerning the newest member of our unusual family concerning the arrival of a real dominate ALPA male who Ally brought home and fell in love with,
I was working with the FBI, Interpol, and Lloyds of London in solving the kidnapping of 8 men,
I took on a criminal case involving Allys new Love; whereas he was arrested for caning a young lady in a BDSM relationship. This case will become very interesting in the future, but it concerns everyone who practices any part of BDSM; you will want to stay tuned for this outcome,
I got to make love to one of the smartest, the most pretty, the most Lady, the intelligent Cally; my wife.
Just thinking about how much I love Cally brings tears to my eyes.
I am the luckiest shemale sissy maid in the entire world!" />
