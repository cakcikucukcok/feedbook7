  <title>The Sleeping King - Cindy Dees, Bill Flippin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Sleeping King&lt;/i&gt; is the start of a new fantasy series by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author, Cindy Dees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dees has won a Golden Heart Award, two RITAs for Category Suspense and Adventure and has also twice snared RT&#39;s Series Romantic Suspense of the Year. She is a great storyteller, and the adventures in her more than fifty novels are often inspired by her own life. Dees is an Air Force vet-the youngest female pilot in Air Force history-and fought in the first Gulf War. She&#39;s had amazing adventures, and she&#39;s used her experiences to tell some kickass stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as much as she love romances, Cindy&#39;s other passion has been fantasy gaming. For almost twenty years she&#39;s been involved with Dragon Crest, one of the original live action role-playing games. She&#39;s the story content creator on the game, and wanted to do an epic fantasy based on it, with the blessing and input of Dragon Crest founder Bill Flippin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sleeping King is the first in an epic fantasy series, featuring the best of the genre: near immortal imperial overlords, a prophecy of a sleeping elven king who&#39;s said to be the savior of the races . . . and two young people who are set on a path to save the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Sleeping King Trilogy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;The Sleeping King&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#2 &lt;i&gt;The Dreaming Hunt&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#3 &lt;i&gt;The Wandering War&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
