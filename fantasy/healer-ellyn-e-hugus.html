Living on the outskirts of present-day Chicago, Kaya quickly realizes that she must keep her gift a secretsomething she finds increasingly difficult as the demands of being a Peace Keeper take over her life and those of her sibling-housemates.&lt;/p&gt;
Kaya and her fellow Peace Keepers, Lisbeth Moore and Thomas McCarthy, work to prevent Ashlinn Tiernays global warming vendetta from destroying the planet they call home.

There, a bizarre turn of events has Kaya questioning everything she thought she knew about herself and her Peace Keeper family. Now only time will tell whether theyll be able to keep themselves and the earth safe, as uncountable lives hang in the balance.&lt;p&gt;
In this third installment of the Peace Keeper series, an ancient battle reaches its climax, and one young woman must choose whether to use her healing abilities to save the planet.&lt;p&gt;" />
