  <title>The Fifth Jewel of Earth - James W. Greenhalge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Then quietly the Counselor continued, Your traveling is needed again. The pendant you wear was purchased at an awesome price. That much is finished! And no principality or powerin heaven or on earthcan undo that accomplishment. The bridge has been rebuilt and the path has been thrown open. Now you must complete your traveling in fear and trembling. Salvation is between you and the King, but working out your salvation is between you and Me. Wisdom has been given to allow you to see the plan, Knowledge to understand the circumstances, and Belief in the Plan to strengthen you for the long, hard journey. Choosing life, here the Counselor hesitated, touched again by the inestimable cost of that horrific sacrifice, provides you with an inerrant compass toward home. Now I need you to acquire Right Standing, the privilege to face the Creator in His throne room. He is perfection itself, chosen mortal, and all imperfection will be consumed by His righteous indignation. Your best efforts will not be enough! 
Not enough? The last sentence echoed down the corridor. Your best efforts will not be enough? How was he to acquire something which his best efforts could not attain? 
How do you acquire the unattainable? Fifth in the Jewels of Earth collection, the continued fighting in the forever war has already cost the king His life and the Traveler narrowly escaped with his own. To return to the fluid battlefield of time is dangerous enough, but the enemy is attempting to alter the timeline and the forces of the Cabala are taking matters into their own hands. Failure forfeits the future. Yet even if he succeeds, the Traveler risks never being able to return home. 
His journey is yours. Join the resistance! There is a jewel waiting for you!" />
