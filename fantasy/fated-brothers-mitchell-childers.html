  <title>Fated Brothers - Mitchell Childers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was a dark and stormy night, and the elfin army was massed,
standing at attention in the middle of a clearing of the forest. At the head
of this army of about two hundred archers and three hundred swordsman
were two figures with armor alike yet unalike the other soldiers. One was a
tall-standing, young-looking elf woman holding a broadsword to her front
with both hands casually on the handle, the blade in the ground. She was
wearing a shiny crown of silver and gold on her head, and her long white
hair was done in one thick braid at her back that reached down to the
base of her spine. Her armor was somewhat heavy, finely made, and was
of good shiny steel lined with gold that covered most of her body. What
didnt cover her body revealed a dress underneath that was made of either
silk or something like it. Standing next to her was a slightly shorter and
younger woman who had features like the other. Her armor was a little
skimpier, but of the same material. Steel bracers around her forearms
as well as somewhat long steel boots gave her limbs some protection.
The rest was a chest plate and an Averis chain skirt that went down to
her knees, Averis being a special metal made entirely by elves. The skirt
has individual scaled plates of its own, and both the chest plate and skirt
together exposed her midsection. On her head was a tiara. All of the armor
was fit perfectly to her small but muscular, tone frame. Her hair was blond
and short, barely reaching her elegant shoulders and was combed back. She
stood there beside the older woman with two elegantly curved shortswords
held backward in each hand.
The army stood in wait on top of a hill overlooking a dark fort a
half a mile away surrounded by numerous monsters of many types and
configurations but all an ugly, twisted human form. The two women in
front stood there for the longest time saying nothing and not moving an
inch. All that could be heard was the sound of thunder and the rain hitting
their armor. Just then, the silence was broken by the eldest woman in front.
She said, Neiren. The younger woman turned to her in response. I want
you to do something for me. The younger woman looked at her with deep
concern." />
