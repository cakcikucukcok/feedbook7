  <title>Seize the Night - Sherrilyn Kenyon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Valerius isn&#39;t a popular Dark-Hunter-he&#39;s a Roman, which means that the largely Greek Hunters have a major grudge against him and his civilization for superceding them. To make things worse, he&#39;s very conscious of his aristocratic background and breeding. So it serves him right when he runs into Tabitha Devereaux. She&#39;s sassy, sexy, and completely unwilling to take him seriously. (Not to mention that she&#39;s the twin sister of the wife of former Dark-Hunter Kyrian-Val&#39;s mortal enemy.) What Tabitha does take seriously is hunting and killing vampires-and soon she and Val have to grapple with the deadliest of all Daimons-one who&#39;s managed to come back from the dead, and one who holds a serious grudge against both of them. To win against evil, Val will have to loosen up, learn to trust, and put everything on the line to protect a man he hates and a woman who drives him nuts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
