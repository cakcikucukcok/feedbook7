  <title>Feather Bower Freedom - Jenny Dixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;T o save the lost civilization of Atlantis and her family, she must sacrifice her wings, her power, and her identity, and pass through eight levels of consciousness to complete a total transformation. With only her powerful crystal heart pendant to protect her, she embarks on the terrible but crucial quest. Powerful enemiesmenacing beasts with yellow tusks, red eyes, and powerful pawsseek to claim her pendant as their own at any cost. Through life-threatening circumstances, Selene must remember her mission before the lost ones perish in the sands.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;During a dream, Miss Jay learns of Selenes imprisonment by the red-eyed creatures. Miss Jay gathers the birds and Vargo the dragon for a daring rescue mission. Before they can hope to save the goddess, Miss Jay must travel to Shamballa to meet with Sanat Kumara and other ascended masters and then undergo her own transformation.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What she learns at the temple of Selenes parents changes everything: many other goddessesincluding Selenes mother, Vestaare also missing. Equally troubling, she discovers that the sacred Rainbow Crystal Egg needed to help the Earth enter its next phase has been stolen.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the shadows, another force awakens. As soon as Selene placed the crystal heart around her neck, a signal was sent out across the cosmos. In response, the enigmatic Caretaker emerges from a long slumber.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Who is this being?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can the heroes trust the Caretaker?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Who will reach Selene first?&lt;/P&gt;" />
