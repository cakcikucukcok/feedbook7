  <title>The Calling - Christine Swanson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the world was Lore and Lore delighted the eye. It spread itself across the land, whispered to men through the earth and foliage, through crystalline devices. Here, one form of Lore develops-there, some diverse facet, each the embodiment of man&#39;s greatness. But Lore is cunning, for men can only think to be great, and conscience often doesn&#39;t speak loudly enough. 
&lt;p&gt;
Here is the epic struggle between men and the Lore they wield, a conflict mirrored in the ordeals faced by the hero who would save them. He was bred to be a leader, a Lifeward with no other emotion than anger. What strange hand turns a stone heart into an aching void? What unworthy Lifeward dares to live such blasphemy? Adored by some, but despised by his own kind, Saydon is beleaguered by his flaws, disgusted with himself. And yet, he refuses to surrender, for above all else, he is goaded to answer the whispers calling his name." />
