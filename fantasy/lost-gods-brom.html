Now the lives and very souls of his wife and unborn child are at stake.To save them, he must journey into the bowels of purgatory in search of a sacred key promised to restore the natural order of life and death. Alone, confused, and damned, Chet steels himself against the unfathomable terrors awaiting him as he descends into death&amp;#8217;s stygian blackness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Lost Gods&lt;/em&gt;, Brom&amp;#8217;s gritty and visceral&amp;#160;writing takes us on a haunting, harrowing journey into the depths of the underworld. Thrust into a realm of madness and chaos, where ancient gods and demons battle over the dead, and where cabals of souls conspire to overthrow their masters, Chet plays a dangerous game, risking eternal damnation to save his family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
