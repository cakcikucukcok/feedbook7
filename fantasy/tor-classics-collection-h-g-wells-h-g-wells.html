  <title>Tor Classics Collection: H.G. Wells - H. G. Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tor Classics Collection: H. G. Wells&lt;/i&gt; discounted ebundle collects four timeless novels from the father of modern science fiction. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; They came form outer space--Mars, to be exact. With deadly heat-rays and giant fighting machines they want to conquer Earth and keep humans as their slaves. Nothing seems to stop them as they spread terror and death across the planet. It is the start of the most important war in Earth&#39;s history. And Earth will never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;: &lt;/b&gt;The time? 802,701 A.D. The place? An Earth stranger than you can imagine. The people? A pretty, childlike race, the Eloi--and their distant cousins, the Morlocks: disgusting, hairy creatures who live in caves and feed on the flesh of--what? Enter the Time Traveller, who has hurtled almost a million years into the future. After the Morlocks steal his machine he may be trapped there...and at their mercy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Island of Dr. Moreau&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; Edward Prendick survived a shipwreck only to find himself at the mercy of an infamous scientist. Exiled from England because of his gruesome experiments in vivisection, Dr. Moreau has taken up residence in this remote paradise in order to continue his work. His goal: To create a new, superior race of beings! His legacy, however, would prove to be a nightmare beyond comprehension...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Invisible Man&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; It began with a quiet country inn--and a mysterious stranger, his features masked by gloves, dark glasses, and bandages that completely covered his head. Then came weird noises, the disembodied ravings, the phantom robberies, the haunted furniture...The violence...The rampages...The killing. An obscure scientist named Griffin had found a way to turn skin, flesh, blood and bones invisible--and tried the formula on himself. He could go anywhere; spy; steal; menace anyone. The Invisible Man had only two problems. He couldn&#39;t turn visible again. And he had gone quite murderously insane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All editions are complete and unabridged, and feature Introductions and Afterwords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
