She can now face Grimlindus, the general, necromancer and suave lord of evil, who wields the all-powerful Sword of Death.  But Grimlindus has raised his armies and is preparing to invade the west.  Their first mission is to conquer the Esengater, the Iron City, held by the female knights of the Order of the Dragon Slayer.  Ariadnes companions travel to the corners of the Westland to raise the forces to stop him.  They are in a race against Grimlinduss demons, sorcerers and assassins, who are trying to stop the west from mobilising. Meanwhile, Ariadne travels to the Mystic Isles to forge the weapon that she will use in the final battle: Sword of Life.  Because, in the end, it will be a duel between the Sword of Life and the Sword of Death." />
