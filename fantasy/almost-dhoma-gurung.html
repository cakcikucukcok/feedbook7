  <title>Almost - Dhoma Gurung</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stella isnt the typical high school student, obsessed with boys and gossip. Shes never really fit in, although she does try. She gets her schoolwork done on time and attends the parties other kids deem important. She even had a boyfriend once, but thats all over now. She just needs to make it through high school and move on.
Then, she meets both Dylan and Charles and is surprised by her romantic feelings. She does believe in fate and eternal lovefor other people. She cant see herself ever settling down for happily ever after, but here are two boys who seem to care for her; will she be able to choose one, or will Stella get in her own way?
She has a secret. Shes been hiding this secret since she can remember: a secret about her people. She holds to her privacy with a vice-like grip, knowing the truth could destroy her friends and family. Stella wants to choose love, but deep down, she knows she must protect the people she cares about from a dangerous villain. That villain is Stella herself." />
