  <title>Last First Snow - Max Gladstone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Brilliant, elegant, epic, astonishing, smart, gritty.... another wondrous visit to the fantastic world of the Craft Sequence.&quot; --Ken Liu, author of &lt;i&gt;The Grace of Kings&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Max Gladstone&#39;s Craft Sequence chronicles the epic struggle to build a just society in a modern fantasy world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty years after the God Wars, Dresediel Lex bears the scars of liberation-especially in the Skittersill, a poor district still bound by the fallen gods&#39; decaying edicts. As long as the gods&#39; wards last, they strangle development; when they fail, demons will be loosed upon the city. The King in Red hires Elayne Kevarian of the Craft firm Kelethres, Albrecht, and Ao to fix the wards, but the Skittersill&#39;s people have their own ideas. A protest rises against Elayne&#39;s work, led by Temoc, a warrior-priest turned community organizer who wants to build a peaceful future for his city, his wife, and his young son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Elayne drags Temoc and the King in Red to the bargaining table, old wounds reopen, old gods stir in their graves, civil blood breaks to new mutiny, and profiteers circle in the desert sky. Elayne and Temoc must fight conspiracy, dark magic, and their own demons to save the peace-or failing that, to save as many people as they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set in a phenomenally built world in which lawyers ride lightning bolts, souls are currency, and cities are powered by the remains of fallen gods, Max Gladstone&#39;s Craft Sequence introduces readers to a modern fantasy landscape and an epic struggle to build a just society.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more from Max Gladstone, check out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Craft Sequence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three Parts Dead&lt;br&gt;Two Serpents Rise&lt;br&gt;Full Fathom Five&lt;br&gt;Last First Snow&lt;br&gt;Four Roads Cross&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
