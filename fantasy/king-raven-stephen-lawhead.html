  <title>King Raven - Stephen Lawhead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A completely re-imagined epic of the man known as Robin Hood&lt;/b&gt;—&lt;b&gt;available in one volume for the first time.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries, the legend of Robin Hood and his band of thieves has captivated the imagination. Now the familiar tale takes on new life as it boldly relocates the setting to the Welsh countryside and its dark forests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hunted like an animal by Norman invaders, Bran ap Brychan, heir to the throne of Elfael, has abandoned his father&#39;s kingdom and fled to the greenwood. There, in the primeval forest of the Welsh borders, danger surrounds him--for this woodland is a living, breathing entity with mysterious powers and secrets. Bran must find a way to make it his own if he is to survive and become King Raven.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From deep in the forest, Bran, Will Scarlet, and Friar Tuck form a daring plan for deliverance, knowing that failure means death for them all--and the dreams of the oppressed people of Wales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This acclaimed trilogy (&lt;i&gt;Hood, Scarlet, Tuck&lt;/i&gt;) conjures up an ancient past and holds a mirror to contemporary realities. Prepare yourself for an epic tale that dares to shatter everything you thought you knew about Robin Hood.&lt;/p&gt;" />
