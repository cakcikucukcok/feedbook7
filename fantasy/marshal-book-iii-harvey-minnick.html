  <title>Marshal Book Iii - Harvey Minnick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marshal Book III, Out Of The Cold,  is two stories in one,  Marshal and the rest of the HERO team are sent to Greenland to find out what happened to a missing research team that was reportedly under attack by penguins when all contact was lost. The heroes have to struggle to save themselves and a small village from the erupting volcano while the support team back in Chicago learns how Marshal survived being stranded and space and fought off a ship load of space vampires. It&#39;s funny, its exciting and its just  more proof that life on Earth will never be the same after the Coming Of Marshal.
