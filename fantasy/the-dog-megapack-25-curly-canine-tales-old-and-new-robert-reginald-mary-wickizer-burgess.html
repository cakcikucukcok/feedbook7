  <title>The Dog MEGAPACK ®: 25 Curly Canine Tales, Old and New - Robert Reginald, Mary Wickizer Burgess</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Almost everyone likes dogs, even those who prefer cats as pets. So it&#39;s not surprising that writers have devoted a great deal of verbiage indeed to describe their ongoing love affair with the canine breed. You&#39;ll find herein all kinds of tales focusing on dogs: science fiction stories, mysteries, horror tales, westerns, memoirs, humorous accounts, and first-person doggie narratives. There are well-known pieces by writers such as Jack London, James Oliver Curwood, Washington Irving, Saki, E. C. Tubb, John Gregory Betancourt, Robert Hood, and Jack Dann--and stories by authors who are relatively unknown today. &lt;P&gt; Here are twenty-five marvelous tales of dogs and their interactions with humans, plus five bonus poems: &lt;P&gt;&quot;The Call of the Wild,&quot; by Jack London&lt;BR&gt; &quot;My Friend Bobby,&quot; by Alan E. Nourse&lt;BR&gt; &quot;Neb,&quot; by Robert Reginald&lt;BR&gt; &quot;My Friend,&quot; by Anonymous [poem]&lt;BR&gt; &quot;Kerfol,&quot; by Edith Wharton&lt;BR&gt; &quot;The Monster,&quot; by S. M.
