  <title>The Catalysts - Ruby Nari Mayo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was going on ten o&#39;clock the next morning when Luther heard a car pull into the ranch yard. He opened the barn door and saw the SUV. The driver&#39;s and two back doors open and three people got out. Luther stopped in his tracks. Now who in the heck was this? Could it be his new southern cook had two children? Why hadn&#39;t he mentioned that little bit of news on the phone yesterday? Well, we&#39;ll see about this! He wasnt a happy man. 
Luther walked purposely toward the car that stood by the front porch. Just then a chilled wind whipped the ladys hat away. The womans hair, free of its confine, flew out like a blond flag streaming in the wind. She reached up grabbing at her hair as the same frisky wind opened her coat wide enough for Luther to catch a glimpse of this delightfully shapedlady. 
OhWow! Luthers anger was momentarily forgotten that she was here to interview for a job. Myohmy, some southern lady, was all he could think! As he walked toward her he swept up her hat that was tumbling along the ground. 
&quot;Welcome to Rocking Horse, Maam, I&#39;m Luther Strong-bow. he was rather proud of being able to overcome his surprise. 
Im Miss Golight, Sir. Oh, that velvety, southern voice. Lord, help me now! 
Ah, pleased to meet you. Wed better go in as the storm looks to be arriving earlier than expected.&quot; he said and offered the hat back to her. Luther opened the front door and caught a whiff of some light perfume as she passed by him causing his nose to quiver like a rabbit&#39;s. Whoa boy, thats not a good sign. Luther struggled to bring himself back to a business-like mode." />
