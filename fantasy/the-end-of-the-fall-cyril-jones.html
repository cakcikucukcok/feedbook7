  <title>The End of the Fall - Cyril Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE END OF THE FALL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; tackles, head-on, the daunting issues that most people are concerned about, just one decade into the third millennium. Why has mankind reached a point in history where there are no feasible solutions to its problems? Climate change is but a symptom of all the damage being done to the environment; and that damage is but a symptom of all that has gone badly wrong with mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earths most well-known cosmological physicist has recommended that mankind should find another planet capable of sustaining human life, by the end of this century. But would there be any point in a handful of space-shipborn survivors, creating some hi-tech prison on planet X, just so a remnant of the mortal human race could survive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prophecies of the Bible give us hope that, in spite of the horrendous chain of events which will soon commence, there will be survivorsand good governanceright here on Earth. Moreover, there will be peace, prosperity, happiness, and harmony between all nations, under one King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is a Christian who visualizes himself transformed and transported to Heaven, when the phenomenon known as the Rapture occurs. He thus escapes the catastrophic events of the Great Tribulation. Among millions of transformed believers, he returns to Earth for the duration of Christs millennial reign, to help the more than one billion survivors in their efforts to restore Earths environment. Surviving Gods final judgement, he reflects on mankinds history, from the 20th century to Satans final revolt against God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
