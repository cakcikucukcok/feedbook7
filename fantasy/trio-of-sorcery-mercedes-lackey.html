  <title>Trio of Sorcery - Mercedes Lackey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Mercedes Lackey presents &lt;i&gt;Trio of Sorcery&lt;/i&gt;, three exciting short urban fantasy novels featuring three resourceful heroines and three different takes on the modern world and on magics both modern and ancient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Arcanum 101&lt;/i&gt;:  Diana Tregarde, practicing witch, romance novelist, Guardian of the Earth. Studying at Harvard, Diana is approached by Joe O&#39;Brian, a young cop who has already seen more than one unusual thing during his budding career. The distraught mother of a kidnap victim is taking advice from a &quot;psychic&quot; and interfering in the police investigation. Will Diana prove that the psychic is a fake? Unfortunately, the psychic is not a fake, but a very wicked witch--and the child&#39;s kidnapper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Drums&lt;/i&gt;:  Jennifer Talldeer, shaman, private investigator, member of the Osage tribe. Most of Jennie&#39;s work is regular PI stuff, but Nathan Begay brings her a problem she&#39;s never seen before. His girlfriend, Caroline, is Chickasaw to his Navaho, but that&#39;s not the problem. Somehow, Caroline has attracted the attention of an angry Osage ghost. Thwarted in love while alive, the ghost has chosen Caroline to be his bride in death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ghost in the Machine&lt;/i&gt;:  Ellen McBride: computer programmer extraordinaire, techno-shaman. The programmers and players of a new MMORPG find that the game&#39;s &quot;boss,&quot; a wendigo, is &quot;killing&quot; everyone--even the programmers&#39; characters with their god-like powers. A brilliant debugger, Ellen discovers that the massive computing power of the game&#39;s servers have created a breach between the supernatural world and our own. This wendigo isn&#39;t a bit of code, it&#39;s the real thing . . . and it&#39;s on the brink of breaking out of the computers and into the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
