  <title>He Stands Alone - Randy Lee Eickhoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Randy Lee Eickhoff, the award-winning translator of the epic Ulster Cycle, continues his retelling of Ireland&#39;s spellbinding history and folklore in &lt;i&gt;He Stands Alone&lt;/i&gt;. For the very first time, Randy Lee Eickhoff has combined several translations of the tale of the Irish Achilles, Cuchulainn, to provide a new and searching look at the warrior whose dedication to his country became the inspiration for Irish rebels in 1916, providing them with a rallying cry heard throughout all of Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning with Cuchulainn&#39;s mysterious birth, Eickhoff skillfully weaves the tale of the magical warrior; from his training with Scathach, the dreaded woman warrior, to his first encounter with the war-goddess, Morigan, a story that foreshadows Cuchulainn&#39;s heroic action the Cattle Raid of Cooley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuchulainn&#39;s adventures unfold as he grows in battle to become the king&#39;s champion, but, all the while, he struggles with his mortal side, and with human failings that inevitably draw him away from his wife, Emer, and under the spell of the mystical Fand, wife of the Irish sea-god, Manannan Mac Lir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a style that is often compared to Nobel Prize winner Seamus Heaney&#39;s, Randy Lee Eickhoff demonstrates his knowledge and storytelling ability and once again introduces readers to a truly fascinating aspect of Irish mythology with &lt;i&gt;He Stands Alone.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
