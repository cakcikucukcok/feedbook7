  <title>The Peril of a Saint - Kenneth ‘Cutrite’ Oaitse Moeng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kenneth Cutrite Moeng has a crude imagination of self and the worldmost importantly the spiritual world. In his writing, he often imagines being lifted up and away into a world above this one, a world full of possibilities, and looking back at life on earth as a force and recreating scenes that translate into poems. 
When you read his poems, the words will automatically build motion pictures in your mind, hence allowing you to glide with the flow. 
In this journey of a poetry anthology and tales, you will be exposed to a mosaic that emotes imagination and reason, hope and despair, pessimism, sanguinity, amorousness, cynicism, empathy, melancholy, desolation, reverence, and sometimes absolute debauchery. 
This book with its varied range and style intends to inspire you spiritually. Tap into untapped leaps in logic; captivate your imagination and broadening your thinking perspective. Use fear as an opportunity to seek a better understanding of common beliefs on how to love amidst hopelessness. Ultimately a sanctuary of living a positive life without regrets by understanding the will to possess power spiritually." />
