  <title>The Possibilities - Yves Domond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Possibilities&lt;/i&gt; presents an inspiring collection of poetry from poet Yves Domond. He has captured his life experiences in his verse, from the intricacy of friendships to the immense importance of family in our lives. His observations dig deep into the depths of the soul as they scan the beauty of our fragility. Whats the sense of living life without pushing the envelope and finding the sweet spot where thoughts become reality?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;From the raw emotion of missing his mother in Thanksgiving without Mom to the reality of relationships in Frustrations at Their Peak, Domond depicts the wide emotional range of his life experiences. He also delves into the very personal topics of being abandoned by his father and understanding love in his relationships with his siblings.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Possibilities&lt;/i&gt; is an inspiring collection of poetry that chronicles the ups and downs of a life well-lived.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;Walk in the Park&lt;/CENTER&gt;
New energy that jump-starts the new day forward
Conversations with strangers and new found friends rejuvenate
Transition from one topic to another is remarkable
To be free to talk to strangers without any regard of judgment
Pretty bold when you size it up
To actually step back and let God do his work
To exercise faith phenomenal to know
You have someone to lean on no matter what
Do boldness and faith dance together?
Or the audacity of knowing the fi rst engagement based on body language is a go?" />
