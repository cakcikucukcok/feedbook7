  <title>Closer - Albert W. Starkey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Vibrantly imaginative and starkly honest, Closer  takes the reader into realms that most of us are hesitant to traverse. Al shows us it is worth taking the journey into spiritual doubt, to face images of death and to bear the loss of our own bearings. His poetry carries us deeply into places where we can touch love along with her inescapable companions-- grief, gratitude, suffering and redemption. With his gifted capacity to bring meaning into paradox, Al gives us poetry that moves into darkness lightly and opens the way into the mysteries of the myriad losses and renewals we experience in this life. Amplified by the beautiful illustrations of John Francis, this poetry rises like a thin wind over an oceans ever shifting tides.
Praise for Closer
There is a  line that I love in this collection:  I cant turn blood into ink. That is exactly what Al does in his poems: he turns the blood he has shed and feels in his veins and translates it all into words, poems, ink; he turns the sea into ink, dreams into ink, children, grandchildren, hope, loss, mountains, grief, peonies, birds - all into ink and that is his art.

This is a collection of reflections on the most difficult journey  the search for meaning in life for a sensitive human being- a journey looking for and being looked for. The beauty of language is picked with care and the love of a true poet moulding the poems into a thing of elegance and of haunting reverberations. There are yearnings, memories and glances into moments of deep pain and moments of pure beauty intermingling, even in the same sentence. These poems expose the deepest emotions and allow a glimpse into the soul.

There is a beautiful use of language in these poems such that the words take on a power of their own  an event, a punctuation, can change your life.  There is a common thread here: a glimpse into the mystical, moving far away to find something close by and getting tragically lost or tantalisingly, nearly found.

These poems each stand as an individual personality in their own wisdom and strength. I would even describe one or two as Monoliths. I found I could not rush through them and indeed, had to put them down and let certain phrases just circulate and dialogue with my own experiences in this fractured world. Als work is very journeyed on a human level and he is a very articulate and personable travel guide as he maps out the terrain anecdotally and otherwise. The familiarity and honesty around human &#39;being&#39; including its suffering and spiritual salvation strike at the &#39;deep heart&#39;s core&#39; of me... Hard to define...not always easy or pleasant, definitely not...but always sure-footed, rich and finely tuned.
