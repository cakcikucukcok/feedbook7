  <title>The Greatest Love of All - Rock Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The Greatest Love of All&quot; is a powerful, deeply contemplative book about a journey with God. A compilation of intense Christian poetry and Catholic apologetics. Moving, inspiring love sonnets to God, Christmas poems that will put you in the manger with the Holy Family and Passion poems that will make you feel like you were standing at the foot of the Cross on the first Good Friday. There are also great, unanswerable questions for God. Atheists don&#39;t believe in God&#39;s existence at all; but there must be a God because matter cannot cause itself and complex life cannot come from unintelligent matter. As Albert Einstein ingeniously said, &quot;The perfect order of the Universe is proof of the existence of God.&quot; The author always sarcastically tells atheists that he will contemplate their extremely unscientific &quot;Big Bang&quot; theory when they can blow up a pile of lumber and a house comes down.&quot; No, there absolutely must to be a God. The enormous questions this book asks are: &quot;How did a perfect and all powerful God create such an incredibly imperfect world with foreknowledge and omnipotence? How does a kind and merciful, holy, all good and loving Heavenly Father sit on a throne in Paradise while He is safe and sound and watch the Nazi Holocaust and all the rest of human pain and suffering?&quot; &quot;The Greatest Love of All&quot; is universal in it&#39;s appeal and will be a part of the curriculum for college theology classes around the world stirring vigorous intellectual debate everywhere. This book is a compelling, must read for all spiritual people." />
