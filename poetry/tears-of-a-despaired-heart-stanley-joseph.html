  <title>Tears of a Despaired Heart - Stanley Joseph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Delve into an emotionally heady stream of poetic storytelling as Stanley Joseph fans out his extensive life experience in a vivid collection that melts together love, longing and desire for an egalitarian society into one heart-piercing blend.
Like fine chocolate dissolving in the mouth, Stanley Josephs lyrical expressions of love and inspiration leave behind a tingling sensation with poems rendering the heart a house brimming with inspiration in It Is True, yet contradicting himself when he protests that love is often full of unnecessary pain in Survivor of Love.
Notwithstanding, he shows his strong capacity for affection in Will You Love Me Once Again?, defying rejection with the heart-fluttering declaration:
If I change all seasons into fall/If I make you my only golden flower/The one which embellishes my spring/If I make you the only dream of my nights/The fantasy of my days, the journey of my life/Will you love me once again?
Coming from an immigrant background, Joseph displays a heightened sensitivity to the happenings around him, enabling him to comment commandingly on discrimination and poverty while still maintaining poetic cadence, as he remarks, In Heaven,/Are there people starving? Stepping on each other?/I would like to know better, to inevitably conclude, Oh, what a life? Its only beautiful for some.
Meanwhile, he unhappily comments that racism is a self decision of a modern day caveman and that he walks in a cutthroat world, a furious jungle full of lions.
Oozing with feeling fused into weeping lines of lament or ripe words of inspiration, Stanley Josephs poetic musings of a despaired heart debuts dramatically into the genre with his unique poetic brand." />
