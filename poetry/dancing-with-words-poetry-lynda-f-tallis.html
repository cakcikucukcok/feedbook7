  <title>Dancing with Words: Poetry - Lynda F. Tallis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Words from the Cauldron Born&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Journey with Poetry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;The Cauldron of the Underworld:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;In which inspiration, wisdom and knowledge are brewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living with dyslexia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child I had poetry and stories locked inside but as I have dyslexia it was hard to put them down onto paper. In the 50s dyslexia was not recognised and no support was available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with Computers my words can take flight with all the new software available. I joined the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids. And along the path of a Bard, I found the courage to show and publish my work and as an Ovate the spiritual voice now as a Druid the knowledge to share and encourage others to find there gifts and share them with all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope my words inspire other dyslexic sufferers to unleash their hidden talents to find their written voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Poetry based on my spiritual path of Druidry, of nature, people and places that have inspired me over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
