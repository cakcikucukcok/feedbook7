  <title>Cicada Chimes - Helen Koukoutsis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cicada Chimes&lt;/em&gt; is set over a twenty-four-hour period covering several years in time lapse; it moves from a funeral service in Rookwood, to a honeymoon in Paris, to the morning markets in Serres, Greece, and a church service in Surry Hills. The twenty-four-hour time structure is Helen Koukoutsis&amp;rsquo; way of exploring the effects of her father&amp;rsquo;s death and mother&amp;rsquo;s grief on her Australian-Greek Orthodox identity. Written with understated humour, these poems smile at the tensions between marriage and motherhood, memory and forgetfulness, and life and death.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Poignant, bittersweet memories. A journey from Greece to Australia, to Europe and back into the Ithaca of one&amp;rsquo;s self. Poems that are lean, stripped to the bones of language with the calm tenacity of Emily Dickinson. Helen Koukoutsis questions tradition, religion, society, academia, her own strengths and frailties as a daughter, sister, wife, mother. And all the while the chimes of the cicadas in Rookwood Cemetery are ringing in her ears, following. Forever.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; Peter Skrzynecki OAM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;In her impressive debut collection, Helen Koukoutsis moves among &amp;ldquo;homes and tables&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; from coastal Greece to suburban Australia, across Europe and over the span of literature &amp;ndash; to bring us a new poetry of everyday experience. These stories of love and grief are threaded together with vitality and care. Kasseri, cicadas and &amp;ldquo;thirsting dianthus&amp;rdquo; crowd together alongside mothers, lovers and daughters. Koukoutsis writes deftly, in sure measure, with Emily Dickinson at one hand and Virginia Woolf at the other.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; Kate Fagan&lt;/p&gt;" />
