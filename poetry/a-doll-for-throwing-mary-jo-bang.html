  <title>A Doll for Throwing - Mary Jo Bang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The exquisite new collection by the award-winning poet Mary Jo Bang, author of &lt;i&gt;The Last Two Seconds&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Elegy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;We were ridiculous--me, with my high jinks and hat. Him, with his boredom and drink. I look back now and see buildings so thick that the life I thought I was making then is nothing but interlocking angles and above them, that blot of gray sky I sometimes saw. Underneath is the edge of what wasn&#39;t known then. When I would go. When I would come back. What I would be when.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--from &quot;One Glass Negative&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Doll for Throwing&lt;/i&gt; takes its title from the Bauhaus artist Alma Siedhoff-Buscher&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Wurfpuppe&lt;/i&gt;, a flexible and durable woven doll that, if thrown, would land with  grace. A ventriloquist is also said to &quot;throw&quot; her voice into a doll  that rests on the knee. Mary Jo Bang&#39;s prose poems in this fascinating book create a speaker who had been a part of the Bauhaus school in Germany a century ago and who had also seen the school&#39;s collapse when it was shut by the Nazis in 1933. Since this speaker is not a person but only a construct, she is also equally alive in the present and gives  voice to the conditions of both time periods: nostalgia, xenophobia, and  political extremism. The life of the Bauhaus photographer Lucia Moholy  echoes across these poems--the end of her marriage, the loss of her negatives, and her effort to continue to make work and be known for  having made it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
