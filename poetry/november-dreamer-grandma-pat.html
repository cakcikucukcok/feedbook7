  <title>November Dreamer - Grandma Pat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a book of poems, written in two parts.
The first part is general poems about many things from animals of all kinds to situations people find themselves in and even some funny problems. Also, there are a few philosophic poems. A few of the poems are based on nursery rhymes-3 or 4.
The second part is written in the Japanese form of poetry called &quot;Haiku&quot; or &quot;Senryu.&quot;
It has only three lines and seventeen syllables. Count them. There are 5 syllables in the first line, 7 in the second, and 5 in the third.  These poems are supposed to create one clear thought focusing each poem toward that thought. Haiku are Nature poems and Senryu are poems that focus on human emotions. 
Many thanks for looking at my book. I hope it gives you much pleasure.
Grandma Pat." />
