  <title>Semmaster&#39;s Thoughts - Steven Eugene Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Semmaster&#39;s Thoughts are poems written and based on the struggles of a small town boy trying to cope with being different. He was too tall to be a midget or dwarf and not tall enough to be &quot;normal.&quot; His self esteem sunk lower than a clam at the bottom of a pond when his brother drowned in a lake on a farm that he was working on. His brother was sixteen years old, in the prime of his life, leaving his fourteen years old brother to ponder how to continue life without his mentor. Tommy, the young boy&#39;s brother, was perceived as a god, with the boy&#39;s entire identity dependent on the personality and actions of this boyhood man. The gift of lyrical expression was thrust within the soul of this boy, to connect with a higher and mightier mentor, to guide him through adulthood. As he grew into a man, a soldier, a husband and a father, the gift took control of the little man as he began to master his craft. The poems in this book show the progression of the mind of a troubled boys evolution into a man of controversy. This book delves into the complexities, the simple, the humorous and reflective views of &quot;The Little Man&quot; who grew to be known as Semmaster. Calligraphy on front cover done by Kris L. Stephens.&lt;/P&gt;
