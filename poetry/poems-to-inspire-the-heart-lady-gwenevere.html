  <title>Poems to Inspire the Heart - Lady Gwenevere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hi, my name is Gwenevere. Im also known as Lady Gwenevere. It is
my delight to share my poems with you. These poems fl owed from the
heart of God to my heart a few years ago. They have been cultivated and
modifi ed over this time to what I present to you today. I am a born again
believer, a disciple of the Lord. I have been for a few decades.
During these years Ive grown, matured and learned many truths about
The Word of God, and of God Himself. These truth came through His
Word, His Spirit and through excellent Pastors and Ministers.
Once my poems were nearly complete, I asked the Lord, What do you
want me to do with the poems? He said, I want you to use these poems to
draw men to Me. To save some of the many lost souls in the world. Also,
seek to comfort and encourage my believers, helping them to stand on My
Word. Salvation, encouragement, and comfort are greatly needed in this
turbulent world. Trouble and uncertainty are on the rise. But Gods Word
is true and certain. My response was, Yes Lord.
I am a sinner that has been saved by the grace of God. I know trusting
in God is the best life a person can live. So I present these poems to you.
My prayer for you is, these poems will draw you near to The Lord. Hear
and receive in your heart what the Lord is saying to you. Be blessed." />
