      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;One feels accompanied by the poet in these pages; through gardens, along country roads and city streets, along windswept coastlines and out on the water.

We also ponder occasional memories and wonderings about times long ago.

And in judicious balance, other haiku indulge in subtle suggestion, offering hints of the extraordinary within the ordinary and even allude to the numinous. Most delightfully we meet the poet in these words as we find ourselves moved by that which moves her, sharing a few moments along this winding path, where it leads&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; Simon Hanson&lt;/p&gt;" />
