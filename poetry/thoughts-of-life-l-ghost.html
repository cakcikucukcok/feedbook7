  <title>Thoughts of Life - L. Ghost</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wrote this book cause I like helping other just by talking with them not to them. This book is mainly my thought&#39;s about life in general, from talking with people about their problems in hopes that they have a better understanding as to life as I see it. and from movies I&#39;ve seen over the years that something that was said in the movie or what certain things people say that sticks in my mind till I sit and write something down in regards to the statement that was said. 
Most of the things I wrote about basically stem from my life&#39;s experiences, some of the things in the book may hit close to home as to say. Other words you may feel that I wrote about you. It&#39;s just something to think about. 
i live in Knoxville ,TN. at this time but I have live in a lot of cities and states mainly within partly some of the 48 states of the USA, never had the chance to leave this country. And I basically lived off and on either on the streets or alone since I was 16 yrs old. So one could say I&#39;ve been there done that. And it has taken me years to write this book." />
