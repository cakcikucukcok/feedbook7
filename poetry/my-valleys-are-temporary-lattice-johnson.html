My Valleys Are Temporary is basically Lattices life. This book is filled with
poems about growing up in this world feeling unloved, unwanted and why
was I born. Living life in self destruction because you just dont care anymore.
Getting to the point where you try to take your life because you just cant
endure the pain, hurt, disappointments and heartache any more. At some
point in life, we live down in the valley. The place where nobody feel we are
worthy enough to be something and somebody but at some point you have
to see the mountain top and begin to climb." />
