  <title>Feelings of a Faith to Heaven - Jeneen Nicole Buchanan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Writing Feelings of a Faith to Heaven: The Inspirational Poems took 8 to 10 years to prepare because I was very ill and financially despaired, just by looking at my work it seems that it would take a month or two to write.  Writing my poems took a lot of thought because each day was different for me but it didnt change my views about God.  While writing my poems I questioned God about a lot of things that was happening to me  and I still do, but I always get that old saying, You should not question God about certain things., I wondered, why not?, he is the reason why we all are here on earth.   Other inspirations gave me some point of views in poetry; I use songs that I like to listen to, my family, and television.  With the songs, I like to listen to gospel, Christian contemporary,pop,jazz and old melody altervetive 70s and 80s music. With my family, I love to listen to my grandma because she has a lot of wisdom and she knows more about life because shes almost approaching 100.  My mother, she is strong in God which gives me a sort of strengthening in keeping God in my life and my brother who is a babe in Christ, he gives me admiration in keeping God in my heart.  All these wonderful beings are true to my heart and my poetry.  Television, in using it in my poems is educational because it gets me to know more about what is going on in our world, our being, our nature, and just life itself.  Through that God used me to listen to all those things and I use them in my poetry to the best of my ability as I see them from day to day.  My poems are simple but yet complicated in a way because some things are hard to translate and some are as simple as a wink.  I try to write my poems as simple as I can for the readers so they can give a though or two about them.  If not, maybe they can translate them to best of their ability and still give their thoughts and views about my poems. I wrote the poems because I love Jesus, I needed guidance from God, and to help or connect to people who want to find God, to get closer to God, to dream beyond their imagination, and to be delivered by God so that maybe one day they will be free. Also, to find themselves and the nature of life in how they see it as I did and still do. I hope and pray that readers will enjoy my work and feel to read it over again to be uplift. Enjoy the poems and happy reading!!!" />
