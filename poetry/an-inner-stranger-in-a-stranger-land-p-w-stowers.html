  <title>An Inner Stranger in a Stranger Land - P.W. Stowers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a book of nothing. Or is it? Poet P.W. Stowers experienced extreme tragedy in his life following a traumatic motorcycle accident. He embraced alcohol as his only escape from the pain of living. But even at the bottom of a bottle his mind wandered until he found meditation and a re-awakening of forgotten truths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Inner Stranger in a Stranger Land&lt;/i&gt; is one mans journeythrough wordsfrom hurt to healing. He conquered harmful escapist activities to seek a greater truth by listening to the voice within. He sought the bigger questions about life and death, and he found them, amplified by his longing for a higher purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His is not a collection of spiritual poems. He does not wish to preach to his readers. Instead, he shares what he found in the hopes of reaching onejust oneperson who may be on his or her own destructive path. If his words inspire one person to see things differently, his long journey of pain will not be for nothing, but for everything. &lt;/p&gt;" />
