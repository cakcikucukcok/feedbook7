  <title>Three Thirty A.M. - Chaim Tzvi Tanny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is in honor of my late mother, Faiga (Phyllis) may she rest in peace  who passed away on what is commonly known by the misnomer Mothers Day (May 8, 2011 or the 4th of the Hebrew month of IYAR, 5771). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are four types of people:&lt;br&gt;
1. Naturally humorous&lt;br&gt;
2. Naturally serious&lt;br&gt;
3. Generally humorous, with some seriousness&lt;br&gt;
4. Generally serious with some humor&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My mother was raised by a serious Polish-born father with some humor and a humorous British lady with some seriousness. She emulated the best of her parents and passed on these qualities to her sons, especially this one as is evident in the prose. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We hope and pray that these poems will reflect her positive nature and inspire our dear readers. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Please treat this book with respect as there are many quotations from holy writings." />
