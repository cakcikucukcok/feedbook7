  <title>Portrait of a Family: Remembering Mom - Mary Ellen (Scarborough) Abbott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a book of poems written about the author&#39;s family as she reflects after her mother has passed on.  It is a celebration of the mother&#39;s life, but also a book to minister to others as they walk the same path....&quot;first holidays&quot; without her mom....shares memories of those holidays of her childhood.  It speaks of the eight years of Friday night dinners with her mom and her last years of dementia as she and her brother come visit and become known as the Crock-pot Gang.  From big extended family Fourth of July picnics in the 1950s to the 2008 Fourth of July celebration with her son and daughter-in-law in Boston, listening to the Boston Pops on the Charles River, her remembrances are shared.  Her mothers love of family and the memories of all those years is the essential theme behind the poem.  It is a celebration of family. The strength of families is the strength of nations- the strength of the world." />
