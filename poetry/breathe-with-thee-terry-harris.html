  <title>Breathe with Thee - Terry Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A collection of poems, each born out of life experiences of the author, from the pain of hardships and despair to the joyful exuberance of watching God work in faithful and miraculous ways. They are stories of Gods faithfulness, love, forgiveness, redemption, and hope. They are also stories of how God uses His creation to bless us and meet us where we are. Each one inspired by God, these poems speak to everyone who is feeling the pain of personal hurt or the joy of Gods amazing love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have known Terry for many years, and I know that she loves the creative, from crafts and beautiful albums to her love for writing poetry. She is a true inspiration to all. From her various joys and trials, she has poured out her heart on paper in the form of meaningful poetry that will sometimes grip your soul, sometimes make you laugh, and other times soothe your heart. Breathe with Thee is a recommended read for anyone who enjoys this creative way with words. An added treat is the array of her beautiful photos that she has included to complement her poems. Caroline Adams Miller, MAPP, author, speaker, performance coach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terrys poetry speaks to the faithfulness, love, and majesty of our God in a way that will stir your heart to love and trust Him more in your life. Ray Lynch, author, speaker, and founder and president of LifeChange Concepts, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;" />
