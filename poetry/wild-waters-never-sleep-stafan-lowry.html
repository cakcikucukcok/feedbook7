  <title>Wild Waters Never Sleep - Stafan Lowry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wild Waters Never Sleep is an all new and best of collection of poetry from the author of From the Igloo Confessional, Winterland, and Venom and Nectar; Stefan Lowry. In this poetic voyage brimming with insight and words from the soul, the author entices the reader with poems that surge to another time and place wrapped around the threads of natures beauty. Returning to classical poetic themes yet written in contemporary forms, Wild Waters Never Sleep brings together the best of Stefan Lowrys canon of work over the last ten years while welcoming the reader into new seas of majestic atmospheres and enrapturing wonder. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eloquent yet grandeur of ancient China is brought to life in Nanjing Road; The Album, a tribute of sorts to the work and life of Li Po. Featuring poems such as
The Chow Mein Lady, Gold Spun Rain, and The Peony Emperor. This brocade of written structures flows with the mighty waters that wind deep from the Far East into the readers imagination. The Cathedral Forest sees a return to nature that will remind readers of the authors first book, Flight of the Imagination. These pools of poetry take readers into Technicolor Rain, Kingdoms Under the Sun, and Bells Back Home. The next movement brings the Hummingbird Hotel to life in rich color and voice. A wanderlust set of poems, featuring Direct Light, Origami Glass, and To All the Saints. Maelstrom collects some of the authors best work over the last decade inside one frame. Including new versions and edits, revisit Far to the North, To Catch Mona Lisa, and Procession of the Flying Seahorses. Finally, Wild Waters brings us to Canadian Creek, a cozy simple collection the author penned over ten years ago and has never been published till now. Maple Leaf Mine, Prosper O Newfoundland, and Legende de un Province and more take us to a faraway place of solitude and quiet beauty. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This collection comes round full circle from a writer who continues to emerge with new word art and the blending of traditional and contemporary, giving readers something new to always discover. The currents in Wild Waters Never Sleep flow and ebb to new literary shores, and remind the reader the beauty and adventure that is poetic art. &lt;/P&gt;" />
