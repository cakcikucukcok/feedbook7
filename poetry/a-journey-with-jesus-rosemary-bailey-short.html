  <title>A Journey with Jesus - Rosemary Bailey Short</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; A Journey with Jesus is a collection of poems inspired by God for the journey to know Him more. It was April 1972, two weeks before Easter that my father died. My world crumbled..I knew there had to be a deeper faith. My journey began as I intentionally sought to know Him through Bible study and in reading His Word. The following Easter, I realized with deeper understanding, that Jesus death was Gods unmerited gift to me. I understood the paradox of death.. A terrible loss but also, a gift. The death of Jesus brought the gift of eternal life; my dads death led me on a journey to understand the magnitude of Gods great gift. My journey with Jesus began in 1972 and continues today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I believe that as you read these poems in your own quiet time, you too, can hear the voice of the Good Shepherd and become that little lamb who loves the shepherd.&lt;/p&gt;" />
