  <title>The Emily Dickinson Collection - Emily Dickinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Emily Dickinson&amp;nbsp;was an American poet, born in&amp;nbsp;Amherst,&amp;nbsp;Massachusetts&amp;nbsp;into a prominent family with strong ties to its community. After studying at the&amp;nbsp;Amherst Academy&amp;nbsp;for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the&amp;nbsp;Mount Holyoke Female Seminary&amp;nbsp;before returning to her family&amp;#39;s house in Amherst.&lt;br /&gt;
Evidence suggests that Dickinson lived much of her life in isolation. Considered an eccentric by locals, she developed a penchant for white clothing and was known for her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, to even leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most friendships between her and others depended entirely upon correspondence.&lt;br /&gt;
While Dickinson was a prolific poet, fewer than a dozen of her nearly 1,800 poems were published during her lifetime. The poems published then, were usually edited significantly to fit conventional poetic rules. Her poems were unique in her era. They contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use&amp;nbsp;slant rhyme&amp;nbsp;as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation. Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends." />
