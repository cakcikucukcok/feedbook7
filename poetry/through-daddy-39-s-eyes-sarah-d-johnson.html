  <title>Through Daddy&#39;s Eyes - Sarah D. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A child esteems and looks up to the father. This authority figure holds muc importance in the development of a youth. Children on the other hand are considered and pitied by their fathers. This dichotomy is similar in dealings of a child of God with the Heavenly Father. We love and esteem Him and He loves and pitys us. He is always trying to help us to take the best roads for our life. He always looks to find ways to help and bless.
Through Daddy&#39;s Eyes looks at a father and the Father through the prism of youth and mortality, respectively. It herald these unique and personal relationships showing their precious weight in gold and beyond.
It is the author&#39;s hope that every man will see how important he is in the life of some child - how he is looked to for guidance, assurance, advice and hope. When a child can see himself Through Daddy&#39;s Eyes and emerge with a smile of self-assurance, that man has accomplished much in his lifetime." />
