  <title>A Castle for a Princess - Johnny Wong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The title of my book called &quot;Castle for a Princess.&quot;  About my niece Nicole Casey, poetry and short stories under her named.  She&#39;s my favorite niece.  The manuscripts explained how &quot;Uncle Johnny&quot; viewed the world around him, by writing imaginary, poetic, creativity things for Nicole.  I had written stuffs, concerning injustices, human suffering, compassions, understanding, loving kindness, forgiveness.
My message toward her audiences, a good writer doesn&#39;t write about him or herself, but a good writers writes about how people influences me from childhoods to adulthoods.  Now what I said the truth, pleased whoever reading, not saying or using false humanities, condemning myself, so peoples could blessed, boosted about me.
I myself did not lived a very good life, never desired my niece&#39;s, nephews, I wanted Nicki not to follow my footsteps.  I give the best stuffs to her.  Often told Nicki &quot;my generosity, m writing, my music, never &quot;Uncle Johnny&quot;, belongs to Nicki.
This manuscript and to the audience when it comes to any form of art, such as writers, entertainers, sport athletics, never dream too big, do not have too high expectation.  On the other hand, I told &quot;others don&#39;t ever give up your dream.&quot;  Many famous author kept a diary when they&#39;re young, started writing in their high school news letters, then editor, columnist for big new papers such as the New York Times, Dairy News, New York Post, News Days.  Many hold full times jobs, and did free-lance writings for famous persons.
One day an Afro-American woman said in front of PSCH class, said to everybody sitting down, &quot;Johnny a good writer, I really enjoyed reading his writing.&quot;
My response was &quot;many people enjoyed reading my stuff, on the other hand, I might never get it published.&quot;  &quot;Being an author not considered an easy task, I &#39;ll have to be able to received criticism for others.&quot;  &quot;Johnny never give up hope, never stop, always think the good in life, someday some publisher would be knocking on your door, sooner or later, your writing will be publisher.&quot;  Those words were coming from Sonia." />
