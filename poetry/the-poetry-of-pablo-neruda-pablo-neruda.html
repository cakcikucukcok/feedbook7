  <title>The Poetry of Pablo Neruda - Pablo Neruda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The most comprehensive English-language collection of work ever by  &quot;the greatest poet of the twentieth century-in any language&quot; (Gabriel  García Márquez)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his work a continent awakens to  consciousness,&quot; wrote the Swedish Academy in awarding the Nobel Prize to  Pablo Neruda, author of more than thirty-five books of poetry and one  of Latin America&#39;s most revered writers and political figures-a loyal  member of the Communist party, a lifelong diplomat and onetime senator, a  man lionized during his lifetime as &quot;the people&#39;s poet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born  Neftali Basoalto, Neruda adopted his pen name in fear of his family&#39;s  disapproval, and yet by the age of twenty-five he was already famous for  the book&lt;i&gt; Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair&lt;/i&gt;, which remains  his most beloved. During the next fifty years, a seemingly boundless  metaphorical language linked his romantic fantasies and the fierce moral  and political compass-exemplified in books such as &lt;i&gt;Canto Genera&lt;/i&gt;l-that made him an adamant champion of the dignity of ordinary men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edited  and with an introduction by Ilan Stavans, this is the most  comprehensive single-volume collection of this prolific poet&#39;s work in  English. Here the finest translations of nearly six hundred poems by  Neruda are collected and join specially commissioned new translations  that attest to Neruda&#39;s still-resounding presence in American letters.&lt;/p&gt;" />
