  <title>Assault with a Verbal Weapon! - Doneareum Shamar Winston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Testing one, two testing one, two!! Ladies and Gentleman may I please have your attention?! You may now be seated as you prepare to be taken on an emotional and memorable journey through comedy, drama, romance, faith, heartache and break, deception, ignorance, love, hate, laughter, and tears!! 
&quot;Why are there so many broken men and women today in our relationships and marriages in need of healing? Why are our men and women not taking accountability for thier faults, misdeeds, and actions toward one another? What is causing this seemingly endless cycle that continues to affect and tear down our future generations? Why are our men and women constantly at &quot;war&quot; with each other when it comes to balancing power and control? Where does this hurt, pain, retaliation, and aspect of redemption originate? Is it in our minds or our hearts? Is it Biblical? Is it generational? Why can we not surrender the essence of our entire beings fully, to love? Why are we playing mental and physical games with and destroying each other on a day to day basis? Why are our mouths, minds, and hearts being used as weapons to kill the spirits and souls of one another? Why do we continue to endlessly attack?! How are our &quot;adult&quot; problems and issues effecting our children and teenagers?!&quot; 
&quot;Assault with a Verbal Weapon,&quot; is the follow-up memoir to the book &quot;Panning For Gold&quot; which takes you on a poetic trip through the lessons of young adulthood. Chapters 13-22, follows a 19 year old young man who has recently been emancipated from the system as a ward of the state after 13 years and is now having to come to terms with and face the music of life in the real world as a game of &quot;musical chairs&quot; begin to unfold!" />
