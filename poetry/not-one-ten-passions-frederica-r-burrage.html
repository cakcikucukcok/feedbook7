  <title>Not One Ten Passions - Frederica R. Burrage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Not One Ten Passions is a collection of thoughts that explores my passions and priorities in life. This is a journey through ones spiritual mind, in hopes of expressing whats important in life. In order for us to attain happiness and fulfillment, we must first recognize what we are passionate about. What makes a person smile? Having a sense of purpose leads people to figure out their personal goals and the strategies necessary to obtain them. It is never too late to take risks, but why wait? Once you form your vision, you have to put effort into seeing it become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a long time in the making. I wanted to share with others my most favorite things. What makes my heart flutter is being smothered by my two daughters and being surrounded by Gods creations. Everyone experiences situations differently. We have to respect each others viewpoints and understand that what matters to one should affect us all. Looking on the bright side of things, we must focus on ourselves, and then we can better help our communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encouraging words have a profound effect on our emotions. I hope to be able to motivate and inspire others to seek their full potential. If faced with obstacles, you must brush yourself off and keep pressing forward.&lt;/p&gt;" />
