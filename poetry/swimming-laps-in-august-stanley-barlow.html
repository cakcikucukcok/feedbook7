  <title>Swimming Laps in August - Stanley Barlow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The author says of this collection:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My poems are my life on paper, in snapshots of course. I try to recapture the emotions of remembered scenes and to render them with a moderately subdued passion. Actually, I have long withheld some of these poems, fearing they are a little too personal, but with age comes loss of inhibition, perhaps a discreet loss. I hold hands with the child in me, youth, . . . all the mes, none of which vanishes from whatever I am. Not that I am proud of all of them, but I may be more accepting of them now than I sometimes was. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Barlow looks back on careers as WWII celestial navigator in the Air Force (in service, 1943-6),  Presbyterian minister (1950-), and educator. Now, an emeritus professor of philosophy (College of Staten Island) City University of New York (retired in 1995), he was a professor of religion at Columbia University, 1966-72, and also served as a dean of summer session at the University of Minnesota, 1964-66, and Columbia, 1966-71, as Associate Dean of Faculty, at Staten Island Community College, a predecessor to the College of Staten Island, 1972-76. Earlier, he served as a campus minister, in Eugene Oregon (1954-60) and in Pittsburgh, Pa. (1960-62), and still earlier, as parish minister in New York, Tennessee, and Alabama. In 1950-51, he taught English literature at East Tennessee State University, in his hometown.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;He has written poems since boyhood. Here he has selected over seventy. The themes include love and marriage, parenting, ones own childhood, and life in community. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here are a few excerpts:--&lt;P&gt;About an eleven month old son: &quot;He salutes me and gives me a smile like /eternal blessing and a handful of straw /he has pulled from the broom.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;About the lonely child living in the midst of remote relatives and preoccupied neighbors: &quot;Crowded /by circles of kin /neighbors /fieriest stars /the nearest /distant ones &lt;P&gt; /more inviting /Distant all . . .&quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the title poem, which he actually composed while swimming, shortly before a birthday in his sixties, he sees the water stretching out like a magic carpet, yet cant free himself from the thought of all he has not done, the books he has not read and of course the cruelty of times passing;  he ends the poem saying, in rhythm with his strokes:: &quot;. . . miles like inches the carpet /flies it flies /into years old how many now.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As his ninety-one year old mother lay dying twelve hundred miles away, he woke from a dream and captured it in this poem:  &quot;Lady wrapt in ink blue /coat in soft lamplight &lt;P&gt;/kerchief about your head /all set to leave /us silent poised /silhouetted /on the edge of the chaise longue /that reaches back to the beginning&lt;P&gt;/of time . . . .&quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;An elegaic example is a little poem in memory of the environmntalist, Margaret Mee: &lt;P&gt;&quot;Forest seraph /pleading for it /for Amazonias orchids /for blossoms that open at night /pleading as for a child /about to be taken&quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Among the poems about love is this one, from a fairly early date: &lt;P&gt;&quot;A portrait /come alive /to my Beau of Bath /Awkward as sixteen&lt;P&gt;/both of us /innocent as five /I fell into her eyes /certain I was received&lt;P&gt;the moment never dies&quot;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the fourth grouping of poems, which the author calls Orbit, we find this one about the meaning of baseball: the title alludes to Protagoras saying, Man is the measure of all things: &quot;Reach into the air /and stop with your hand /a white sphere /like the moon /See it again rocketing /from your undulant salute /up the blue and glint of the sky /arching against outfield /green and the dust that edges /diamond and scurrying feet /Take a well-formed proposition /of once growing wood /Extending yourself /you hit
the ball /Running you celebrate&quot;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Barlow, known to his friends also as a humorist, includes some humor, though it is often mixed with a bit of pathos," />
