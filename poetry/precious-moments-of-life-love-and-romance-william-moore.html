  <title>Precious Moments of Life, Love and Romance - William Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I write the words just fl ow.
I get an inspiration or a thought
and have to write it down. Why,
I do not know. They just fl ow and all follow a
story. I write my innermost thoughts with the
deepest passion imaginable and all are TRUE
life experiences which have occurred in my
life. I am diagnosed Severe Bipolar Disorder
and disabled and draw SSDI. I no longer have
to work from over 40 yrs in Maintenance and
2 degrees in Electronics and Electrical maintenance. I do draw disability
now for over 2 yrs time and depression is a daily bout which I face every
day, but try to be positive. The medicine I take is for my head and helps
with mood swings and depression. As to date, I cannot read many of
my works as I Bawl like a baby at most of them. I remember when and
how I felt when I wrote them. But all of them follow a story to the
end. I cannot recite a single one because once written they are gone,
otherwise they eat my Brain. I am crying now as I write this and divulge
my deepest thoughts and experiences of my life. I feel better now that
it is gone from my head folks. When a situation arises, I just know
which ones will deserve recognition to be told. I hope all appreciate this
testimony of mine. All I say is true to fact." />
