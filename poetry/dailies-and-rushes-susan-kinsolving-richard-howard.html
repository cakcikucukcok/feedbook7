  <title>Dailies and Rushes - Susan Kinsolving, Richard Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;#147;The passion, playfulness, and regret in these wonderful poems will make many women think this book was written just for them.&amp;#8221; &amp;#151; Susan Cheever&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;Susan Kinsolving&amp;#8217;s poems skate with a dark elegance on the thin ice between the upper air and a deepening sorrow, between the day&amp;#8217;s figures and memory&amp;#8217;s pattern. But she&amp;#8217;s headed towards love: the distant shore, the beckoning warmth; and by the end of Dailies &amp;amp; Rushes she has gotten herself &amp;#151; and, to our delight and gratitude, brought us as well&amp;#151;triumphantly there.&amp;#8221;  &amp;#151; J. D. McClatchy&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;What rings with authenticity in Susan Kinsolving&amp;#8217;s poems is a lovely severity. . . . Sorrow and courage and pleasure register themselves in lucid distillations, like the purities of winter air.&amp;#8221; &amp;#151; Anthony Hecht&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;&amp;#145;Things just are,&amp;#8217; Susan Kinsolving writes, in a matter-of-fact tone that belies a fiery intensity. In her poetry, commonplace things are imbued with a magical aura. Her wry wit clarifies as it deepens a tragic vision.&amp;#8221; &amp;#151; Grace Schulman&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;In her first major collection Susan Kinsolving shows herself to be a poet of ravenous amplitudes, of wit schooled by feeling, of observations had owed by memory, and of landscape rising to what she calls &amp;#145;an oblique sublimity&amp;#8217; which is also the hallmark of her art.&amp;#8221; &amp;#151; Edward Hirsch&lt;/div&gt;" />
