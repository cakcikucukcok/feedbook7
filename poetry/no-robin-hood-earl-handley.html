  <title>No Robin Hood - Earl Handley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No Robin Hood is a collection of poems created over a period of forty years by author Earl Handley. Most of the poems are humorous, a few are sentimental, some are cynical, some are factual, some are entirely fictional, and some are a mixture of fact and fiction. Some of his poems recount poignant times in his life, in A Perspective he talks about the death of his father, while in The Last Trout he talks about his love of fishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the poems are about hunting with the bow and arrow. Although the author has brought home the bacon thirty-nine times using the bow, most of the hunting poems are about his unsuccessful hunts. He learned more from his failures than from his successes, which is evident throughout his poetry collection, No Robin Hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Robin Hood&lt;br /&gt;I was bow-hunting deer at Michaels place*.&lt;br /&gt;I had on a camouflage -outfit and paint on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I had been on my tree-stand since well before dawn.&lt;br /&gt;But I had seen no deer, not even a fawn.&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw him  a six point buck &lt;br /&gt;About sixty-five yards away. I was in luck.&lt;br /&gt;I fumbled for my deer-call and gave it a blow.&lt;br /&gt;But the deer just ignored it. Was volume to low?&lt;br /&gt;The deer turned and disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;Was he gone? That is what I feared.&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly he popped out  he was moving fast.&lt;br /&gt;Before I could draw my bow, he ran past&lt;/p&gt;" />
