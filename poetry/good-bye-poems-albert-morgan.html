  <title>Good-Bye Poems - Albert Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this poetry is dual. Firstly, for humor and entertainment so we can appreciate the things we have. Secondly, to get people to think of the very serious and sobering times we are living in. 
In life we all experience things that breakdown or wear away and need to be replaced or repaired.We can take clothes or items for granted. When certain things are worn away or no longer function, we are forced to take notice. A malfunctioning hot water tank, for example, will really be missed. Like many a property owner, the author knows about the frustration and expenses to replace things. He puts a humorous spin on things with rhymes. 
For example: Good-bye, faithful underwear, I will always remember us as a happy pair. But there is no doubt you are all worn out. You have lost your elasticity; therefore, I will have to dispose of you as fast as electricity. 
Good-bye, suppository; you are important, but you get no glory. 
Good-bye, toilet bowl; I must rid you; that is my goal. 
Good-bye, toothbrush; have to get rid of you in a rush. 
Good-bye, long time refrigerator; I cannot say, see you you later. 
In Poor Richards Almanac, Benjamin Franklin stated, When the wells dry, we know the worth of water. We can appreciate big or small conveniences in life. 
From a religious and serious perspective: Good-bye, America, sorry to see you go, seeing your character and morals have sunk so low. 
Even So Come, Lord Jesus is a prophetic poem. Good-bye, Death and Grave speaks of things and life being temporary. The author ends certain poems with a biblical prophetic and positive message: 
There is a future hope beyond our physical existence." />
