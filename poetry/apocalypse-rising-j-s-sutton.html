  <title>Apocalypse Rising - J.S. Sutton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="J.S.Sutton was born James Shaun Sutton on 21st
April 1987 the youngest of three to Penelope and
Shaun Sutton. He has been writing on and off since
he was 8 but started writing seriously since he was
19. He lived briefl y in Swansea with his ex girlfriend
where he spent most of his time in the many different
bars that litter the city especially bars such as the
offi ce, walkabout, and the Latin jazz joint mambos.
When his ex girlfriend left him he began to drink even
more and would write furiously to rid himself of the
many demons that had accumulated in his brain. Alas
this was not enough so he spent some time in the
psychiatric ward upon his return to Wrexham (where he had come of age) in and out
for 2 and half years.
He is currently living with his parents whilst looking for another place to live locally." />
