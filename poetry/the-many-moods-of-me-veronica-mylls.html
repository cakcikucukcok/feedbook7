  <title>The Many Moods of Me. - Veronica Mylls</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Residing on the twin islands of Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean, has been quite the poetic adventure. Our culture and flamboyant historical background have been passed on through generations, and we as a result are an interesting and colourful intergration of peoples.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I reside in the Port of Spain area and have lived here for most of my life and for as long as I can remember I have been writing, not just poetry, but novels and expressions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have had the honour of having more than one of my poems read(much to my surprise) at graduation ceremonies.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have been all over our fair lands and every part has provided me with stimuli conducive to writing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It is my passion, my joy, my life, and I thank God that I was born here to be a part of such a beautiful country." />
