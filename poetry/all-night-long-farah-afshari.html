New Poetry Book Reflects on Life in and out of Iran
Author Farah Afsharis rhymes and verses muse existentially All Night Long
LONDON  At very young age, author Farah Afshari was exposed to political and social events that shook the foundations of the society she lived in. During that time, she came across individuals who scarified their lives for what they believed would bring freedom for others. The works collected in All Night Long (published by AuthorHouse) reflects upon those times, and those who struggled to create a better future for the ones they loved, during some of the most pivotal moments of Iranian history.
All Night Long is a collection of poems, some written over 30 years ago and some are very recent. The older poems are relevant to the authors experience of having lived as a young person in Iran with political and social unrest over revolution and post revolution years. The younger poems are more relevant to her current views of life and relationship with the people around her. The title of the book is from the poem she wrote nearly 30 years ago. Today, she still feels as strongly about the words in this poem as she did when she wrote it and that is the reason she chose it as the title for this book.
Each poem tells a story of Afshari growing up as a human being and her personal journey through time and places as she experienced many major changes around her. The major theme is selflessness of individuals who sacrificed their being to bring about freedom for others, as well as interpretation of life in general.
Afsharis poems come face to face with the readers feelings and experience of daily life in an intimate way.  While political, social and individual in nature, the poems are rather international and relevant to everyone in the world who can make a connection to them." />
