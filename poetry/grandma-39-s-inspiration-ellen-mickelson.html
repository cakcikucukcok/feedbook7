      <meta name="description" content="Ellen Mickelson: I have enjoyed writing all my life.  These are a collection of prayers and poems that I have written over the years.  I am dedicating this book to my beautiful grand-daughter, Melanie  Camire.  Melanie is fighting a long hard battle against cancer.  At twenty years of age she had surgery to remove a tumor the size of a foot ball.  It was attached to the Kidney.  She lost one kidney.  The cancer had already started to spread and the doctors didnt have a chemo treatment that they thought would work.  Her Doctor got her into a trail at Loyola Hospital and for the last three years Melanie has been fighting this horrible disease.  She know is in a trial that takes her to California.  Any proceeds I get from the sales of this book will go to help Melanie fight this battle.   Thank you for your help and your prayers." />
