  <title>A Woman&#39;s Perspective - Yves-Laure Francisque</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a collection of poetry, which I call floetry because it flowed out of me. This work is an account of my life journey, as the main character and as a bystander, to the things going on around me. I dedicate this book, first of all, to the being that makes all things possible through the name of Jesus Christ: God Almighty! I also dedicate this book to my loving family: the Francisque family. To my mom and dad who love me throughout everything (whether or not weve seen eye to eye). They are the embodiment of unconditional love. Mom and Dad, I love you very much! I wouldnt have been able to pick out better parents if I tried. 
To my siblings, Ashley (who is an attorney-at-law), Andrew (who is currently obtaining his masters degree at NYU), and my youngest brother, Ridge (who is and always will be a powerful man of God). I would also like to acknowledge my editor and friend Terri Anne. My spiritual godmother Bernice. This is also for all the wonderful individuals in the Flint family. I love you, guys. Susan, Ron, Javon, Sakina, Aunt Clara, Uncle Mike, Nikki, Jahall who has touched my life in a positive way. And finally, this is dedicated to the man who shares the parent title with me, my one and only true love, Joshua, and our son Joshua II. 
This book will assist any individualregardless of gender, age, or colorto be able to find someone who relates. Its to remind others (and myself, actually) that there is no need to do it alone. Any circumstance or emotional situation you find yourself in you can always seek people who have been through the same. Take your time out to figure yourself out. If the people in your life truly love you and want to see you happy, they will not contest to you becoming a better person. Dont dwell over those you lose though. Some people dont want you to do better unless theyre up there with you. 
Young people, get your confidence back! Sex shouldnt be a random thing, ladies. If a man demands sex from you, girl, you better demand respect from him. Its give and take. Demand it! I wonder a lot why some girls are so accustomed and find it okay to let a man use you. You will be a mother one day or an aunt, an older sister, etc. Do you really think these actions are going to be something your legacy would like to find out about you? That never made sense to me. So this is for all the girls who struggled with self-esteem, confidence, betrayal, love, abuse, rejection, and so on (which Ive struggled myself). God bless you, and learn to love yourself." />
