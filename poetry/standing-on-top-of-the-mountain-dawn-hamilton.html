  <title>Standing on Top of the Mountain - Dawn Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I thank God every day for giving me a voice through my writing and making a difference to someone along the way. My main reason for writing this book is to let young girls and women who are going through and have been through similar experiencessuch as physical, verbal, and emotional abuse, rape, homelessness, and joblessnessknow that they are not alone and there is always hope. I want to let you know that with faith and strong persistence, you wont lose your self-esteem but build confidence within yourself. You do not have to stay in any situation for any reason whatsoever, for we are all overcomers. Yes, Ive been angry, and Ive felt rage; however, I turned those emotions into positive encounters. I have built my life on the philosophy that my corner of the world will not be the same just because I have passed this way. So in my journey, I have decided to touch as many lives as possible, and I believe the circulation of this book will allow me to touch even more lives. I would like to let others know that they can believe in themselves, their goals, and their dreams because they will become what they believe." />
