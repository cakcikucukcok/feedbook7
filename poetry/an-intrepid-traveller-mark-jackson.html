  <title>An Intrepid Traveller - Mark Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="China is an amazing country. A place that needs time and complete immersion to be able to understand.
I took a job as a tour leader, and instantly I was out of my depth. I experienced places and situations that I could never have been prepared for and all with a group of paying tourists who were looking to me for guidance.
However, this was a steep learning curve covering language, culture, and history. It was not long before I saw that the people who had saved up for their holiday of a lifetime were far less prepared than I was. For over two and a half years, I visited many parts of China and also took groups to Vietnam, Nepal, Mongolia, and Russia. All this time sampling the culture and learning as much as I could about China and this part of Asia. I had some sticky situations and a lot of laughs with friends that I will keep forever.
Would you let me be your tour leader?" />
