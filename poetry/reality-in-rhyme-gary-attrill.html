  <title>Reality in Rhyme - Gary Attrill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I consider that I am a spontaneous writer. I do no planning or preparation of any sort. I have no training or guidance in what or how I write. I am motivated subconsciously by an event, comment, action or just about anything that I find interesting, disturbing or beautiful. I know not what it will be that will next fill my head with words as I cannot write for the sake of writing. I have now compiled approximately 170 poems.
Most of my writing occurs in the middle of the night awoken from sleep with words flying around in my head like bats in a cave. Many times I rise and write immediately. Other times it stays with me repeating itself until the sun rises and its then that I put pen to paper. What annoys me the most is my inability to remember any of my writings. I may remember a line or two but no more. 
I have been writing since 1999 although I did jot down a few lines in 1971 to my then fiance Penelope, after I was conscripted into the Australian army. We married in 1972 and still love, enjoy and cherish the company of each other.
I have compiled these writings so that in years to come my children, grandchildren and any thereafter have an insight into my-self and the times that I lived. It will give them the opportunity to maybe compare their thoughts with mine.
It is with pleasure that I thank my family for their support and belief. But there are also other people without whose encouragement I could not have progressed this far. My wifes late mother Bernadine was my greatest fan. My work colleagues Sandra, Casey, Adam, Sue-Ellen and Denise were always there with feedback.  
I hope also that anyone and everyone who takes the time to read the words that I write get as much pleasure reading them as I do writing them." />
