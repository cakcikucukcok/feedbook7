  <title>P.A.I.N. - Sincere StreetPoet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="P.A.I.N. (People Allover In Need) is a collection of poems from author Sincere StreetPoet that cannot be summed up in just one word. Divided into three parts, P.A.I.N. explores some of the mental and emotional roller coaster rides of life.
In Part I: Loves P.A.I.N., the author explores the wide spectrums of love, from the sheer joy and happiness of being in love (Flower, Dipped My Pen Part II) to the trials and tribulations of a troubled relationship(While You Were Out, Domestic Violence) to the finality of a love ending(Call 911/Divorce), we have all experienced one or more of these emotions at some point in our lives.
Part II: Black P.A.I.N. offers audiences the authors thoughts and feeling as a young African American. From societal ills such as poverty, alcoholism, crime and single parent house holds (Lusting Liberation, The Way It Is), to self destruction within the African American community (Crab N------,Wake Up!!!!!!!!), to racism and oppression (W.H.I.T.E. M.A.N.), Sincere StreetPoet is honest, raw, and uncut with emotion in a plea for all Americans to examine themselves and unite together to heal their wounds.
And finally in Part III: No more P.A.I..N. its the calm after the storm. The emotions and thoughts of a person who has learned to Let It Go, whether venting frustations (Kiss My , Hate) or calling upon a higher power(Thank You Jesus), the author takes the audience to the point of being Finally Free." />
