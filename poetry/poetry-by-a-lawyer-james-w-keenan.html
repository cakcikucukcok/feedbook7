  <title>Poetry by a Lawyer - James W. Keenan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The theme of the reminisces, observations, and opinions, as sought to be poetically expressed in these works, include no intended universal underlying topic but rather result from the authors attempt to achieve a catharsis of the authors frustration to, not having undertaken previously, original art and reflect overwhelmingly the authors occasions of instant inspiration during, almost without exception, the wee hours of the night.
The author touched upon, directly and indirectly, some of his lifes experiences, but also many of his philosophical beliefs, cultural recognitions, and ruminations as to matters of life, love, professional endeavor, and common everyday occurrences and affiliations.
The author intends no single purpose by the content of this work and felt free to ruminate, hold forth, and put his two bits in.
From the content of the work can be gleaned not only many of the authors beliefs and philosophies but his desire for all of us to live it well.
Other than to hope for appreciation of the expressions in the substance of this work, the author aspires to nothing more than tolerant consideration of those expressions herein included." />
