  <title>Search with the Heart - Leda A. McIntyre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;What is love?&lt;br&gt;
small deliberate steps,&lt;br&gt;
standing side by side, hand in hand,&lt;br&gt;
eyes open, hearts connected,&lt;br&gt;
starting over sometimes.&lt;br&gt;
You and me. Check mark today.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all begins with chemistrya magnetic attraction between two people that, if they are lucky enough, eventually transforms into love. In &lt;i&gt;Search with the Heart,&lt;/i&gt; poet Leda McIntyre celebrates the many faces of this spectacular phenomenon, filled with moments of hope and longing, joy and anxiety, and the everyday blessings of trust and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has ever been in love has certainly felt some or all of the accompanying, sweeping emotionsdesire, wistfulness, happiness, sorrow, and compassion. In her first compilation of poetry, McIntyre offers the inspirational, touching poems she has previously given as gifts tucked into luggage, mailed with cards, and folded in lunch bags. With an invitation to share the poems with the loves of their lives, McIntyre lyrically encourages others to reflect on deep feelings that make us all choose and believe in love despite its risks and uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Search with the Heart &lt;/i&gt;is a poignant collection of verse that honestly explores a passionate, often complex feeling, ultimately reminding all of us how important it is to experience love in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
