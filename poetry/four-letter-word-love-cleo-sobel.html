  <title>Four Letter Word Love - Cleo Sobel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What Inspired me to write my love poems
I grew up with lots of love around me and the only way I know how to express myself is to show love, and do love.  In today&#39;s world when I look around me I don&#39;t see any love, where have all the love gone. Husbands and wives not loving each other, brothers and sisters not loving each other, children not loving their parents and visa verse.
One day I decided I wanted to write about love. I wrote love poems to my late husband Jack.
Love thyself and share love with our fellow mam.
Have faith in love, if we give love, it will be returned.
Mother&#39;s love, father&#39;s love Brother and Sister
for sweet hearts, husband and wife, love more, live longer.
Smell the roses and keep on smiling, love you will find
and keep always, just encourage love in the world.
What abut the 3 senior sister and the letter to Santa Too Good To Be True? These are words I write in my poems, I encourage love. I am motivated by love.  My desire is to see everyone read a poem or a word of love and be encouraged and motivated by the words to keep the faith and spread the love.
