  <title>The Anchor of Immortality - Capt. Amrit Cornelius</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This collection of poems is based on the theme of revival of human thoughts and values today, with the changing time and circumstances. It is the advent of a new age, transforming the very nature of man from an immature brute of the past to a mature, understanding sapien, thereby converting, by will, the hell on earth he himself created into a purgatory of happiness and peace. With the Almighty in the philosophical form, which man had forgotten as the Supreme Being and, in continuation, the nature he had tried to intervene with, man has come back to accept that without the Almightys blessings and natures support, existence of any kind of being is on the verge of danger of the doom.
Man today has understood the holistic worth and meaning of life on earth, which primarily calls for the humanistic ideal hidden in the word we and not I for a better living and sustainable development for the generations. This is what can be called as the anchor or foundation of immortality. In this book of poems, empowerment, empathy, and emancipation are at the center to bring about a true revival of the lost tenets of love, peace, and happiness on earth. The major segment of poems tend to reveal the facts of deterioration in universal brotherhood brought about by man by his antinature deeds, but at the same time, it injects a feeling to visualize for himself the intensity of destruction by now and why and how it must be stopped for good for the overall development of life on earth." />
