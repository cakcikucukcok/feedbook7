  <title>Whispers from the Soul - Antonia Guerrero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A book of poetry collected from family memories as a child.
Every poem in the collection pertains to a family member in my life, or special moments.
Also writing was a moment when I could speak from the soul and ended being wonderful therapy.
I found out I could put my feelings away in a box, and return when I wanted to remember my special people. When my sister Annie was dying from cancerous tumors in the head was the most hurtful moments of life. She inspired me to write because my love for her gave me so much power to write about her and preparation to say goodbye." />
