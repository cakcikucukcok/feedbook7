  <title>Angelize - Yvette Marina Nario</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is Yvette Marina Nario, and I was born in New York City and raised in California throughout my middle school and high school years.
At four years of age, I questioned both my parents, &quot;Why are we living if we are going to die?&quot; My deep yearning for understanding the unknown and discovering the truth or real purpose for living has been a quest I&#39;ve always sought and continue to do so as I delve into the forward motion of the hourglass.
As a child, in grade school, I was always very quiet and unconventional for the right reasons of breeding truth and morality, as I do remember throwing an apple at the principal because he didn&#39;t want to bring me home because I didn&#39;t like the fact that my first-grade teacher yelled at my sister, Michelle, for no logical reason. After we made an agreement, the principal ended up driving me back home in the condition I come back to school the next morning as a fully participating student. I have and I will always be one to keep my word when it comes to making promises; that&#39;s how real I am. I remember growing up, I&#39;ve always been very shy, collective, sensitive, at certain points chaotic (for right reasons), and observant. It wasn&#39;t until I grew into California&#39;s people and environment that I&#39;ve gained more of a personal discovery and deep analysis of my inner core. By what may seem as warping in time to the west, as schematics to find myself, I finally felt as if I was at a place called home inside my inner spirits and outside of my physical body. My inner me was in the comfort zone (I so longed searched for since moment of conception) where I needed to be and used as a tool to help direct me into the future: on the right path that was already willed for me as I felt in my heart-mind (only because of my heartbeats).
I met my high school sweetheart at fourteen years of age and have experienced seventeen years of forever growing love/friendship, human development, business success, and family bliss. I have born two beautiful stars, Angelo and Eliza (my Angelize), as a result of the first significant and planned (from above) chapters of my life. My Angelize are my everything, my world, the heart of my life, and the main reason I needed to fulfill my first mission (accounts), my first story of my book. I would have to describe myself as a late bloomer (big time)." />
