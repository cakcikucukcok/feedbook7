  <title>Sometimes We Drift - Douglas Crotty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Written with personal insight, Sometimes We Drift: Poems of Regret, Ruination and Renewal, is a collection of poems in three parts, thematically different in their thrust and emphasis, suggesting a progression from pain to positivity on the bridge between near death of self, and the resurrection of the soul. &lt;p&gt;
Introspection into the heart and mind, in an effort to become whole, exposes the vulnerability of even the strongest among us. As we question ourselves in love and in living, we validate the conflicts many of us face over and over again in our daily lives, including relationships and traumatic natural events over which we have no control. &lt;p&gt;
Douglas Crotty allows us to see through the eyeglass of the human condition, examining the very heart of emotions in our struggle for redemption, in our choices, and in relationships with ourselves and others. &lt;p&gt;
Through his conversational, emotional style, marked by sensitivity and clear imagery, he leads us to a realization of the unquestionable significance of positivity and mindfulness in ones triumph over hopelessness and the damaging realities of life." />
