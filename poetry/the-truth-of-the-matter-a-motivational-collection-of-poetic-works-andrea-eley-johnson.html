      <meta name="description" content="Hurt, fear, and lack of self- esteem is running rampant among the strong, the weak, and those in between but the truth is that we can overcome when we change our thinking and believe in someone greater than ourselves. That someone is God, and with him, our challenges will be a stepping stone to a stronger faith in Him, ourselves the power of His love and out destiny.   The Truth of the Matter is a collection of motivational and inspirational poems intended to uplift. This book can encourage and give sunshine in the dark days, but also add even brighter light to the good days.   Author Andrea Eley Johnson&#39;s limitless love for others inspired this book, as well as the challenges we face.   Filled with divine confidence, she approaches a variety of topics, from faith to body image to love to patriotism to nature, all through the lens of her great faith in God. Her words will speak to all readers who appreciate welcoming emotional poetry that may be easily integrated into daily reflection time." />
