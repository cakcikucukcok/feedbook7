  <title>A World Interrupted - Chico DaVincci Gillum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A World Interrupted is the kind of book that will inspire, uplift and motivate you in ways that you could have never imagined. I admire the fact that I took stories of struggles and brought them to life and was able to inspire someone in need of a voice. I feel that most of the people reading this book could relate to some of its content or know someone who has been through similar situations. I wrote this book with faith, my heart, hard work, persistence, love, and Im truly proud of myself, the man that I am becoming, and those that God have put into my life to help me in every step of the way. If I never meet you in passing, please know that you are the reason that I continue to wake up every morning and make it my job to empower and inspire someone in this world to be the best person that they can become.  I never wanted to be more than what God has planned for my life. I want to be Gods walking vessel and with that being said, I want to ask people for forgiveness in advance, if I one day act out of character or lose myself in this world trying to find the way back to who I am. We as people get so caught up in what others have created us to be that we never really have time to get to know a person for everything that they are. I dont want you to ever feel as if I am one of those people who forget that I am human or that you are human or that we all are a work in progress. My sole purpose for writing this book is to empower and inspire people, to help release any built up feelings or pain that someone may have inside them, that they dont feel like sharing it with others, or maybe they do want to share it with others but dont know who that other person is. I want to help you find yourself and know that no matter what it is that you have been through, I can relate to not only your pain, but personally to your feelings. In closing, thank you for giving me a chance because chance is the reason I am here today. I may live in A World Interrupted, but one day I know a change is going to come for us all.  I will continue to pray to God for strength and courage to do my part and hopefully those of you inspired will walk away attempting to do yours.
With Love,
Chico DaVincci Gillum" />
