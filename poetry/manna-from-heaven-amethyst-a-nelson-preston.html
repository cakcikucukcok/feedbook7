  <title>Manna from Heaven - Amethyst A. Nelson-Preston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book walks you through the process of death and dying in the tapestry of a great and courageous man.  Sams life sketched the bravery and dignity in which he was able to show us how to journey through his disease process in a poetic way.  It not only takes you through the daily journey of Sams life, it also allowed you to look into the window of his family coping process.  Manna from Heaven gives you a glimpse into how one family dealt with the aspect of death and dying, and reveal how each individual dealt with the emotional responses to the prospect of dying.  A large part of the book is really about an individual coping with his immortality, and the honorable e and faithful way in which he was able to claim victory in the face of death.  And it removed the covering, revealing the journey of his family as they tried to cope and live in the midst of his illness, rather than preparing for death.  This book gives a realistic spin, by examining issues faced by the dying and their families.  Such as: emotional feelings, finances, telling the truth about dying, secret desire for miracle cures. The management of pain, and not just physical pain but also, psychological pain that can affect how the dying deals with his disease.  The questions, what is end- of life care? And what are advance directives?  And, the various family dynamics and the difficulties that death and dying brings with it. Moreover, Issues of dying at home, funerals arrangement, bereavement; and life after death." />
