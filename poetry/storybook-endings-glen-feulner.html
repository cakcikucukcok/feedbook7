  <title>Storybook Endings - Glen Feulner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Captivating, complex, impressive and resolute, Storybook Endings Bend[s] the bright lights of tomorrow&quot; into one of the most interesting gatherings of material published in the last decade. Ending explores new ideas with characteristic brilliance and attention to detail. While his writing varies in forms from prose to free verse poetry and everything in between, Feulner is a truth teller, &quot;Look[ing] inside the outside&quot;, he makes his way through the varied forms, and in doing so, seeks to move through the self, the story and the truth in ways that are never short of instantly fascinating and immediately compelling. There aren&#39;t many writers whose language so precisely resonates with the pervasive concerns of the contemporary human condition. Feulner is a powerful writer whose daring and ambitious &quot;Storybook Endings&quot; aims at the heart of extant America and hits their bulls&#39; eye every time.&quot;  -Michelle Greenblatt, Author of &quot;Brain:storm&quot; and &quot;Ashes &amp; Seeds.&quot;" />
