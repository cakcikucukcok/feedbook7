  <title>Three Layers and a Brassierre - Michelle E Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On a frigid November weekend in 2012, I took a trip to Toronto, Ontario, Canada. My plan had been to catch a train, hit the city and just wander about taking in the sights. I wanted a lost weekend, to wander around to find somethingjust what I really didnt know. But these uncertain plans took an unexpected turn when, instead, I hitched a ride with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met an amazing woman named Gwen who was in her eighties, and over the course of the weekend, she shared stories of her remarkable life. One afternoon, we were heading out, and her family, being protective as families can be, gathered sweaters, scarves, and jackets and proceeded to try to convince Gwen to put them all on. Her response: Ive got three layers and a brassiere, thats enough to keep me warm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the ride back to Detroit, I thought about Gwen her life and the three stages of lifechildhood, adulthood, and those final days. Maybe all we need are those three layers, not all those mountains of things, just to see us through to warm our hearts, our spirits, and a brassiere to hold the memories.&lt;/p&gt;" />
