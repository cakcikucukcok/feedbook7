  <title>The Collected Poems of Sara Teasdale (Sonnets to Duse and Other Poems, Helen of Troy and Other Poems, Rivers to the Sea, Love Songs, and Flame and Shadow) - Sara Teasdale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sara Teasdale (1884-1933) became one of the most praised lyric poets of the early twentieth century. In &quot;The Collected Poems,&quot; five of Teasdale&#39;s books of poems are brought together, demonstrating her varied output. Teasdale examines love, loss, and death, all with a beautiful lyricism. Her poems range from the traditional to the experimental as she locates and transforms her poetic voice. Born and raised in St. Louis, Teasdale had fragile health until early adulthood. Upon publishing her first book of poems &quot;Sonnets to Duse and Other Poems&quot; (included in this edition), Teasdale experienced critical and commercial success. She moved to New York City in 1916 where she situated herself with the literary and intellectual communities of the day. Her poetic output continued with regularity though Teasdale experienced bouts of depression with increasing frequency. She would later commit suicide at the age of 48." />
