  <title>Anthology of Poems - Miss Destiny lhuoma Oparah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These works depict my unique style. Its a collection of poems on varied topics. It represents my experience and a reflection of studies that l undertook throughout my university years. Many of these works show contemporary mind-set and world view, even though some reflect the reasoning and sensibilities of years gone by. 
Some secular poems among them speak about the weather, like Summer and Thunderstorm. Others talked about real-life issues, like Sickness and Pain, Birth Process, and Birthday, and the life of a working person, like Workaholics and Composed. 
In this anthology of poems, you will find spiritual poems and others with spiritual undertones and morals, like Sage, Divinity, and Pray, to mention a few. 
Indeed, this collection of my works and poems is instructive, educational, interesting, and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Its fully embedded with poetic devices, especially the use of personification, which is my favourite device used, in a very peculiar form. I hope that you will enjoy this collection. Happy reading!" />
