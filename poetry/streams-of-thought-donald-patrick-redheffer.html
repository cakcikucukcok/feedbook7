  <title>Streams of Thought - Donald Patrick Redheffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the author of Musings of a Meandering Stream, Streams of Thought offers innovative, provocative concepts that challenge the mind and inspire thought. With piercing wit and wisdom, Redheffer tackles a wide range of subjects such as agnosticism, beauty, doubt, hypocrisy, marriage, religion, science, sex, sin, and everything in between in over 1,100 original aphorisms.&lt;p&gt;
An indifferent student yet widely knowledgeable, he has said that he never let school interfere with his education.  At the age of seventy, he began to write down his thinking in aphoristic form.  These aphorisms are faithful to his unique perspective on life.  Most of all, these ideas will encourage the reader to think.&lt;p&gt;
Absence
Absence makes the heart ponder,
Is love to last or will it flounder?&lt;p&gt;
Absence puts friendship on the side,
No way to nourish that which is denied.
Writing
A writers greatest asset is a great reader.&lt;p&gt;
Writing aphorisms becomes an obsession, a magnificent obsession that drives one to explore every aspect of the human condition." />
