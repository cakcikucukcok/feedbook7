  <title>Magic of Divine Love - Dr. Manjusha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a mesmerizing magical journey of divine love... The purest of pure love between Lord Shiva &amp; Gauri. An enchanting narration of the divine pastimes of a Handsome God &amp; His Beautiful Consort; it is not just about their blissful times spent together, but is also an expression of the love between God &amp; His Devotee. This is Gauris journey of love... She is not just Lord Shivas wife, but is also the greatest devotee of Lord Shiva! Gauri, from an ordinary human being became a Goddess solely through the Intensity of  Her love for Lord Shiva! Through Her journey of love, She teaches us the true meaning of Love, Devotion &amp; Surrender and gives this message to us all that whoever, with a pure heart &amp; pious love like Hers will love God unconditionally, will definitely attain His Grace &amp; Love, just like She did... because He resides in all of us, in our hearts, He is The Soul of our soulsIn her all-consuming eagerness to please him, she started dancing with increased ardor; her feet moved very fast . . . the jingling of her anklets became louder than before; it appeared as if each &amp; every pore of her being was reverberating with his name through that blissful dance, wanting to melt in him . . . eventually she lost all consciousness and fell at his feet like a fluttering butterfly! At that very moment the skies thundered, a cool breeze started flowing with the showering of a soft drizzle. Lord Shiva got up from his seat, bent down and with intense care &amp; compassion, picked her up like a dainty flower in his muscular arms! Just by his mere thought, he created a beautiful cavern, the loveliness of which could only be a lovers delight! He went inside &amp; sat down on a bed of perfumed red roses, gently placing his beloved along with him on that bed with her head resting on the soft pillow of his lap . . ." />
