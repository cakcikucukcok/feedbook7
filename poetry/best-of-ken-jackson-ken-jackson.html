  <title>Best of Ken Jackson - Ken Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I started off as a musician in high school playing
guitar and bass. Coming out of high school, I
know some of my own songs as well as other
artists. I didnt start writing poems for a while
though. Except in high school, for English class,
I wrote a poem going  Lets blow up the rotten
school and build ourselves a swimming pool..
and that raised an issue of school threats similar
to bomb threats of this day and age.
Then there was this dirty poem I wrote in my
early 20s. But I was still writing songs then. I took
some college courses in jazz, piano, songwriting
and creative writing.
Back in 85 I recorded with that famous producer. Butch was who produced
Neverworld of nirvana, a number one album of the year in the early 90s.
Then in 86 I started a 20 year sentence for a crime. This is where I started
writing poetry. I took a uw-extension course in creative writing. I wrote a few
and people liked them so I wrote more.
There came a time where I used poetry as therapy. I would write 2 poems
for every 2 weeks. And that beats writers block. A lot of BEST OF KEN
JACKSON has that stuff.
Then I was released in 99 and I put out a bunch of rock n roll albums. I was
also participating in a monthly poetry group for a while. There is a section of
this book I wrote using a variety of student researchers.
Thank you for reading this book.
