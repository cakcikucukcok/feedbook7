  <title>Butterfly Doves - Joshway I. Short</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a young poet, I am a humble, quiet and deep thinker. A lot of times I
meditate on God Almighty, Jesus Christ and I also choose meditation as
an everyday stress reliever. I started seriously writing poetry in 2003, to
be honest; I never really liked poetry and Shakespeare, when I was much
younger. It was until one day, I had feelings for a girl, and I wrote from the
bottom of my soul to my heart, I poured my heart out in that poem. After
that poem, I entered a poetry contest and lost, but I kept on writing, soon
after a while, my hunger for poetry grew. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The amazing part of my life is that God Almighty has saved me so many
times in life, I have a reason to breathe, and what may blow peoples minds.
Is the fact that my mother told me, that she
read poetry to me, while I was in her womb.
So I was already gifted before I existed in
this world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I am inspired by lifes struggles, my own ups
and downs, the simple things in life and
other artists that are poets and musicians
in one. Poetry to me, is a beautiful form of
art, that expresses my true feelings on paper
without using paint on a canvas, I am using
words to paint my picture. Poetry is also an
expressive form of therapy as an outlet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Overall, I just want people in the world to know, that we all have a purpose
in life, and that being human is not easy. My final way of thinking, is that
I want to at least build a small legacy, starting with Butterfly Doves." />
