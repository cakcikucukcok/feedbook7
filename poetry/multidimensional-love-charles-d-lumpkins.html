  <title>Multidimensional Love - Charles D. Lumpkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a literary book of poems and prose to enhance doers and thinkers too see how you can perceive your life through love.  Love is the chief cornerstone of all things known and unknown.  Knowingly, with love, life ( your present life), can blossom into beauty, joy, creativity, art, form, substance, and a myriad of personal experiences that can be felt and appreciated during your lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a man  of African and Native American decent, I wanted gather all the text(s) of the downtrodden American citizen and literally find an answer and a solution worth it&#39;s weight in gold.  That, my friend, is the vortex of inner love. By first loving yourself and using love as your conscious inner vortex, any person, especially the black man in America can use this solution in his life to tell a new story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My late spouse of twenty-eight (28) years, Remelle Lumpkins, ask; &quot;why can&#39;t a black man tell a personal life occurrence without playing on the ills of the American society against him.&quot;  My confession and personal thrust into well being as a citizen of America is to infuse love into all the changes of the downtrodden motif and now speak about  the wonderful book of poems and prose called, &quot;Multidimensional Love.&quot;  As you will see with my poetic life, living in the present with love has a value more precious than gold. PEACE.  Charles Lumpkins author of  &quot;Multidimensional Love&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
