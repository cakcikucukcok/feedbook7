  <title>You Need a Friend - C. Michael Christianson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This collection of poems and commentaries is suitable for both devotional meditations and personal ministry. Individually, each poem has comforted countless souls on their spiritual pilgrimage. Brought together in this edition, they encompass a variety of subjects capable of encouraging and inspiring both saint and sinner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The serious reader will appreciate the spiritual concepts and enduring truths contained in each poem. The commentaries will spark reflective thought as each expose a specific insight gained from the preceding verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You Need a Friend&lt;/i&gt;, in part or whole, is also a ministering tool for anyone desiring to share their Christian experience with family, friends, or acquaintances. So take a peek inside the covers. Youll discover dozens of golden nuggets waiting to uplift a discouraged, hurt, or troubled child of faith. On the other hand, you will find several poems and commentaries that you can share comfortably with individuals outside the body of Christ that warn of the dangers in delay and of the impending judgment to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So dig deep. Precious gems are rarely found on the surface, and a casual glance directed at the Savior of mankind will not suffice in this corrupt and dying world. Stay close to Jesus, your redeemer and guide. In all the storms of life, He will be there for you, for He knows you by name. He has compassion on your circumstances, and He knows &lt;i&gt;You Need a Friend.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
