  <title>Post 1863 America the Beautiful - Thomasena Martin-Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This collection of poems is a glimpse of a world as seen through the eyes of a person who has questioned the accepted definition of both African American / Native American men and women and how they relate to each other trying to fulfill the broken dreams and their search for identity.  Let Me Tell You Who I Am , Chained, On Being Black, express the contradictions American Africans and Native People face as they tract through a world that had denied them equal access and assaults their manhood. 
Such titles as My Knight in Tarnished Armor, My Man, and A Hole in the Soul, express bruised and broken dreams of women who keep in mind that she must survive.
	Then there are those images that tell who these American African Natives are and what Americans, refuse to recognize. Such titles as Once Upon A Time When I Was Colored, Dark Faces, and 6 Million, gives the reader a view of images--- dried up dreams--- that impact the lives of disenfranchised human beings.
	This is the human condition of American African Natives as they try to find their place in a world of constant rejection and turmoil. These Images in Technicolor tell who these Americans really are, and how they refuse to give up when faced with adversity." />
