  <title>Nature Island Verses - Alick Lazare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This small volume of poetry will enchant the reader with its simple and honest portrayal of life on a small, green island in the Caribbean where life takes on the idyll of paradise. The author writes about everyday experiences of love, life and politics in a style that sometimes reverts to the conventional, though more often strongly contemporary. The poems on love are passionate; but with a purity bordering on innocence. Those on life reflect the easy and simple philosophy of a world closest to nature, unhurried and safe. The poems on politics, however, bring to life the harrowing frailties of a democracy rooted in personal relationships and the overbearing possessiveness of the populace that uplift their representatives to the heights of virtual political deities. 
&lt;p&gt;The book is about love, life and politics and reflects the essential aspects of daily existence in a small island society with its joys and pathos and its emotional and spiritual struggles.
&lt;p&gt;The book is captivating in its forthrightness and the ease with which the author takes the reader through the nuance of language and expression, full of Caribbean sound and colour." />
