  <title>The Long and the Short of It - Roy Fisher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This new expanded edition of The Long and the Short of It covers 55 years of Roy Fisher&#39;s poetry. Playing the language, pleasuring the imagination and teasing the senses, Fisher&#39;s witty, inventive and anarchic poetry has given lasting delight to his many dedicated readers for over half a century. Choosing this book on Desert Island Discs, Ian McMillan praised Fisher as &#39;Britain&#39;s greatest living poet&#39;. The Long and the Short of It draws on the entire range of Fisher&#39;s work, from its fraught beginnings in the 1950s through major texts of the 1960s and 1970s such as City, The Ship&#39;s Orchestra and &#39;Wonders of Obligation&#39;, to A Furnace, his 1980s masterpiece, and and then the later work set in the scarred and beautiful North Midlands landscape where he has lived for the past 30 years, notably the Costa-shortlisted Standard Midland (2010), which has been added to this expanded edition. &#39;Fisher stands outside, or alongside, whatever else is happening, an English late modernist whose experiments tend to come off. He is a poet of the city ?his native Birmingham, which he describes as &quot;what I think with&quot;. He is a redeemer of the ordinary, often a great artist of the visible His range is large: he suits both extreme brevity and book-length exploration; his seeming improvisations have a way of turning into architecture. The best place to start is The Long and the Short of It. It might look and sound like nothing on earth at first, but then it becomes indispensable&#39; ?Sean O&#39;Brien, Guardian." />
