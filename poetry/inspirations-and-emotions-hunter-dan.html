  <title>Inspirations and Emotions - Hunter Dan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My name is Daniel Hamel AKA Hunter Dan. Thank you for purchasing a copy of my book of poems. The book is titled, Inspirations and Emotions. The title suits this collection very well. They are all written because a topic or an event inspired me to write it. And the Emotions that I felt while writing virtually all of these, especially the ones written that have to do with my disease. While I was still active and after I went to rehab. There were many many tears shed with pen to the paper. These poems are all inspired by me as a person who in many ways lived a simple life with many complications along the way. So many as you will read are self inflicted. While others I had no control over. I am a man with hobbies, family and friends, and a disease that is in my blood that I let overpower my life. It cost me my second marriage to probably the best thing that ever happened to me. She is a sweetheart and we were supposed to grow old together. Even though we separated she still loved me enough to take me to rehab. We communicated through that and took life one day at a time. We were working on our marriage and were going to stay together, then I made a decision that I regret. It ended our marriage and I had to let go of my best friend. I crushed my own heart. But as The End says, I couldnt stand between her and her family. Writing that poem was like writing my own obituary. People may ask,  why share so many deep dark personal imperfections with the world? My answer: Because I am human, I have made mistakes throughout my life. People do and will continue to. My poems have helped me communicate what I do and feel, and if my poems can help anyone at all with their own life experiences or they can simply relate to one, many or all that is why I chose to share them . Many are about happy times as well. I am proud of each and every poem that I wrote. I am an outdoorsman, I am a son, a brother, a friend, a compassionate citizen (Thinking Of You), an alcoholic in recovery, and a greatful man that I have that at this point in my life. The last ten poems is a chapter of poems that was done collaboratively while I was in rehab by a class I attended. We sat in a circle, each with a clipboard, pen and paper. We wrote the first line that had to be a positive about our recovery. Then passed it to the right and that person wrote a second line and so on until it came back around. Then we read it and wrote the last line. It was alot of fun. They didnt have to rhyme but could. They are creative. They dont exactly have to make sense and for the most part they dont. But it was a real fun exercise, and I made sure I got a copy of them for this book. The titles are just the originators name. It is evident we were in recovery and it was late winter and we had spring fever. I hope you enjoy my book about my crazy life and again I thank you for your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;" />
