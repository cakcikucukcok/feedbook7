  <title>Abc’S of Love - Kevin Bates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If love was just as simple as ABC then life would be a breeze. Yet, sometimes, we are like that three-year-old trying to learn the ABCs, stumbling over our speech looking lost and confused, just hoping someone can tell us how to get it right. This is a fun book of poems with the delight that a three-year-old has when getting it right. Jumping for joy as happy as can be, looking for some kind of reward, maybe just a hug will do.
So this is for those looking to relearn the alphabet in a fun way. If you fall, pick yourself up. This is someone giving a helping hand. Because learning is always growing, then this book is for you. Pick it up, have a good time, and maybe shed a tear or two." />
