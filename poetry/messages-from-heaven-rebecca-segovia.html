  <title>Messages from Heaven - Rebecca Segovia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The writer never having an interest in reading or writing poetry suddenly after the loss of a nine month old grandchild Sarita to a tragic accident began hearing a beautiful subtle voice that would not stop until the voice was written. The writings were poems that delivered a message of love and compassion to humanity. The first messages heard were those of people who had died and the words were in first person as narrated by the heard voice. I began to wonder if my own death was imminent and I was to leave these messages to my children, when the fear subsided, Babies From Heaven started to be heard, these are babies coming from heaven and telling their parents of their arrival, then All of us in Between for mothers, fathers&#39; sons&#39; daughters, and all of humanity. Each poem was voiced in it&#39;s entirety with the urgence for the writer to put on paper. Every word is exactly as it was heard, the message is of love and compassion touching the hearts of all who read them. The name &lt;i&gt;Messages From Heaven&lt;/i&gt; is what they truly are voiced by angels to ease the pain and grief of the writer. The poems since 1994 have been used to give to our hospice client&#39;s family, which they treasure. Recently a person asked me if I beleived in God and when I answered yes, he asked me if I did not think that God had given me these poems to share with humanity, immediately I decided to have them published." />
