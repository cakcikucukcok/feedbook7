  <title>Whispering Pine - George T. Kocik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=&quot;sitb-was-a-p&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 8pt; text-indent: 1em;&quot; align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Everyone starts out in life on the same level. Some achieve fortune and fame; others do not. That doesnt mean that they have lesser value or lead less meaningful lives than those who have achieved glory. Everybody means something to someone, and is important to them. To those who have achieved great things that have benefitted humanity, my hat goes off to them. To those who have achieved fame and fortune through their hard work, I say Good for you, you worked for it. I may not have amassed a great fortune in my lifetime, nor achieved fame, but I am rich nevertheless. I can count on both hands the ones I love and the ones who love me. I can boast, however, of two achievements of which I am extremely proud. The first is my two children, Christine and Kevin. No father can be prouder of his children than I. There I can say: George, you did well. The second achievement of which lm very proud is the collection of poems that lve composed throughout the years. My English teachers gave up on me in high school. They figured I didnt have a snowballs chance in hell where it came to creative writing. I cant blame them either. I didnt see writing in my future at the age of 16. I was content to speak the English language and that was enough for me. I always enjoyed reading poems in school; some more than others. After I graduated and joined the work force, I found that I had a knack for composing. As time went by, my poems got better and better. I was actually proud of the end product. Here again I can say: Well done, George. Everyone wants to leave something of themselves behind as a testimony to their passing through this world. And so, dear children, I leave you my collection of poems. When your eyes peruse the words that lve written, lIl be there beside you. As for you, dear reader, I hope you take great pleasure in reading my poems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
