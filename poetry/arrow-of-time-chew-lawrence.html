  <title>Arrow of Time - Chew Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To read his poems is to be invited into the swirling vortex of quantum physics, philosophy, evolutionary biology and personal biography. Engaging with them is not only a stimulating intellectual exercise it may lead the reader to ponder the nature of the universe and our place in it. 
In these poems, you meet the defiance of modern man, stripped of the easy consolations of God, conversing with silent space. This conversation vacillates from harshness in its relentless logic to tenderness in its lyricism. They do not diminish the human condition nor our unique penchant to seek meaning; but rather counsels a sense of proportion in our reactions to life&#39;s vicissitudes when placed in a cosmic scale.
                                                                                                                     Jeffery Lee (Singapore Poet)
Now on the poems you sent me: they are unique; they carry me along with your carefully chosen words; I cannot describe them because of the sweet meaning you have put hidden all throughout your poems, amazing.
                                                                                                            Christian Jay, Senior Publishing Consultant" />
