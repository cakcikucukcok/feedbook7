      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;The body of a Vestal Virgin is found in the Tiber River, and  soon after, a senator is found having bled to death in his bath. As Roman  authorities turn a strangely blind eye, Hortensia, the daughter of the  capital&#39;s most celebrated orator, begins investigating this trail of murders  that leads straight into the dark heart of Rome.     Â     Despite her husband&#39;s and father&#39;s attempts to protect her, rebelling against the societal constraints to her sex, Hortensia plunges  deeper into the corrupt underworld of the city. And only one man can save her  from becoming the next victim: Lucrio, the ex-gladiator to whom she already  owes her life. But Lucrio has secrets as well, and his past threatens to  subsume both him and Hortensia.    Â     Rivals of the Republic is  the exciting fiction debut from Roman historian and author Annelise  Freisenbruch. Using her supreme knowledge of the period, Freisenbruch delivers  a meticulously accurate and suspenseful mystery that will grip readers from beginning to end.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
