  <title>Saints of Little Paradise - Mc. Donald Dixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A shipwreck on the beach of a yet to be discovered Caribbean Island, brings two civilizations into contact with each other for the first time.  Old World with its history of conquests and deceits meets the new with its virginal naivety, creating a new order that will push the boundaries of history beyond its outer provinces into unknown hemispheres.
Captain John Nichols, an English adventurer is bound for the Guianas in search of the fabled city of El Dorado when disaster strikes.  His ship The Pilgrime is caught in a raging storm and is beached on the island of Hiwanarau, still to be inked in on the maps of seafarers, who sail by, but do not come ashore for fear of being eaten by cannibals.
Buoyed by the unfailing support of his men, Captain Nichols resolves to repair his ship and continue the journey in search of that golden city. Miles Harper is first mate on The Pilgrime, a 16th century caravel that has lost its main mast and listing to port on the sand. 
Fate intervenes when the crew while exploring the island in search of timber to effect repairs to their ship, stumble on a group of men whose complexion and customs are different from their own as a tree is to its seed. This meeting will cause an irreversible change in the lives Miles Harper and Kai Tai, the chieftains daughter, as they become
immersed in each others lives from their first meeting, running the full gamut of human emotions and behaviour including self sacrifice.
We see the origins of a new breed, the crude beginnings of a new world dynasty that will grow in stature to become inheritors of the earth. This is the story of the clash of civilizations and mans enduring will to survive even at great odds and compromises, in inhospitable conditions, among unknown tribes and his ability to adapt to practices alien to his creed in the process of evolution and in so doing create a new race." />
