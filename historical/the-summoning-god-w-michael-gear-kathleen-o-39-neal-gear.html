  <title>The Summoning God - W. Michael Gear, Kathleen O&#39;Neal Gear</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Book II of the Anasazi Mysteries from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling authors Kathleen O&#39;Neal Gear and Michael W. Gear, &lt;i&gt;The Summoning God&lt;/i&gt; is more than a superb murder mystery, it is a psychological thriller with blockbuster action, romance and suspense, and best of all a dynamic plot that will have you holding your breath waiting for the nest step down the dark labyrinth of their serial murderer&#39;s mind. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When world-renowned Canadian Physical Anthropologist, Dr. Maureen Cole, is called to the United States to analyze burials found in an ancient subterranean ceremonial chamber, she is stunned to discover the burned bodies of thirty-three children and two adults. The children were burned in the flesh, meaning they were alive when the fire started, but was the fire an accident or deliberately set? The scattered, mutilated remains of the adults give Maureen her first clue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to solve the mystery she must work with American archaeologist William Dusty Stewart. They&#39;ve worked on two archaeological projects in the past and get along like a mongoose and a cobra. Now they must work together to discover the dark and terrible secret of an ancient people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gears seamlessly weave together modern archaeology and ancient history. Like all of their books,&lt;i&gt; The Summoning God&lt;/i&gt; is based on real archaeological sites that tell a terrifying story of North America eight hundred years ago. Breathtaking descriptions evoke the harsh beauty of the desert, while the lucid, erudite historical perspectives are informed by the authors&#39; own extensive archeological experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
