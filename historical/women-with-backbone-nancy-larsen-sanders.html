  <title>Women with Backbone - Nancy Larsen-Sanders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Strong-willed Deborah Nelson has already endured much in her life. As the Great Depression invades northwest Kansas in 1930, Deborahs denial cannot stop the raw emotions that spread their pain through her once predictable life. Christian, her husband of six years, has disappeared without a trace, leaving Deborah to care for their boys and farm in a mans worldone made even more challenging by threatening, unpredictable weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determined not to wallow in self-pity, Deborah finds comfort in knowing her childhood Indian mentor would want her to take responsibility for her land. After rejecting her fathers demands that she return to Minnesota, Deborah bravely faces her cruel reality. Haunted by dreams that her husband is dead and by the racist remarks of Sheriff Stoddel, who believes she and her little boys are Indians, Deborahs world could not be more challenging. But just as the investigation into Christians disappearance leads to suspicions about both Deborah and family friend Victor Whitesong, a revenge-seeking deputy makes maters much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this poignant historical tale, one woman must call upon all her strength to face life on her beloved land without the love and protection of her missing husband.&lt;/p&gt;" />
