  <title>Steel Tears - Marie Bishop</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the early 1900s, women are not allowed to vote, much less run a business. But societys expectations dont stop the proud and stubborn Jane Odenton from doing what she wants. From the ripe age of eight, she has been prepared by her father for the eventual ownership of his steel factory, Odenton Steel. After her fathers death, she inherits the Ohio factory, where she proves she is capable of not only maintaining the business, but expanding it as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich and powerful, Jane is sought after by the men of her town. Determined that no man will tell her what to do with the family business, Jane rebuffs her many potential suitors. One night, a strange young girl, whom no one seems to know, is found badly beaten on one of Janes supply trains. Taking her to her home, Jane learns of a strange connection between her and the girl, whose name is Elaina Scarborough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haunted by her fathers harsh lessons and the painful loss of her mother, Jane struggles not only against the prejudice of her field, but to find the piece of her she lost long ago.&lt;/p&gt;" />
