  <title>A Burnable Book - Bruce Holsinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Chaucer&amp;#39;s London, betrayal, murder, royal intrigue, mystery, and dangerous politics swirl around the existence of a prophetic book that foretells the deaths of England&amp;#39;s kings. Bruce Holsinger&amp;#39;s&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;A Burnable Book&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;is an irresistible historical thriller reminiscent of the classics&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;An Instance of the Fingerpost, The Name of the Rose,&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;and&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Crimson Petal and the White.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;London, 1385. Surrounded by ruthless courtiers&amp;#8212;including his powerful uncle,&amp;#160;John of Gaunt, and Gaunt&amp;#39;s artful mistress, Katherine Swynford&amp;#8212;England&amp;#39;s young, still untested king, Richard II, is in mortal peril, and the danger is only beginning. Songs are heard across London&amp;#8212;catchy verses said to originate from an ancient book that prophesies the end of England&amp;#39;s kings&amp;#8212;and among the book&amp;#39;s predictions is Richard&amp;#39;s assassination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a few powerful men know that the cryptic lines derive from a &amp;#34;burnable book,&amp;#34; a seditious work that threatens the stability of the realm. To find the manuscript, wily bureaucrat Geoffrey Chaucer turns to fellow poet John Gower, a professional trader in information with connections high and low. Gower discovers that the book and incriminating evidence about its author have fallen&amp;#160;into the unwitting hands of innocents, who will be drawn into a labyrinthine conspiracy that reaches from the king&amp;#39;s court to London&amp;#39;s slums and stews&amp;#8212;and potentially implicates his own son. As the intrigue deepens, it becomes clear that Gower, a man with secrets of his own, may be the last hope to save a king from a terrible fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medieval scholar Bruce Holsinger draws on his vast knowledge of the period to add colorful, authentic detail&amp;#8212;on everything from poetry and bookbinding to court intrigues and brothels&amp;#8212;to this highly entertaining and brilliantly constructed epic literary mystery that brings medieval England gloriously to life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
