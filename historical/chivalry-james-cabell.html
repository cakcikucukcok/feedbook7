  <title>Chivalry - James Cabell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imprimis, as concerns the authenticity of these tales perhaps the less debate may be the higher wisdom, if only because this Nicolas de Caen, by common report, was never a Gradgrindian. And in this volume in particular, writing it (as Nicolas is supposed to have done) in 1470, as a dependant on the Duke of Burgundy, it were but human nature should our author be a little niggardly in his ascription of praiseworthy traits to any member of the house of Lancaster or of Valois. Rather must one in common reason accept him as confessedly a partisan writer, who upon occasion will recolor an event with such nuances as will be least inconvenient to a Yorkist and Burgundian bias.&lt;br /&gt;
The reteller of these stories needs in addition to plead guilty of having abridged the tales with a free hand. Item, these tales have been a trifle pulled about, most notably in&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;THE STORY OF THE SATRAPS,&amp;quot; where it seemed advantageous, on rejection, to put into Gloucester&amp;#39;s mouth a history which in the original version was related ab ovo, and as a sort of bungling prologue to the story proper. Item, some passages have been restored in book-form&amp;mdash;pre-eminently to&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;THE STORY OF THE HOUSEWIFE&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;that in an anterior publication had been unavoidably deleted through consideration of space.&lt;br /&gt;
And&amp;mdash;&amp;quot;sixth and lastly&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;should confession be made that in the present rendering a purely arbitrary title has been assigned this little book; and chiefly for commercial reasons, since the word &amp;quot;dizain&amp;quot; has been adjudged both untranslatable and, in its pristine form, repellantly outr&amp;eacute;.&lt;br /&gt;
You are to give my makeshift, then, a wide interpretation; and are always to remember that in the bleak, florid age these tales commemorate this chivalry was much the rarelier significant of any personal trait than of a world-wide code in consonance with which all estimable people lived and died. Its root was the assumption (uncontested then) that a gentleman will always serve his God, his honor and his lady without any reservation; nor did the many emanating by-laws ever deal with special cases as concerns this triple, fixed, and fundamental homage.&lt;br /&gt;
So here you have a chance to peer at our world&amp;#39;s youth when chivalry was regnant, and common-sense and cowardice were still at nurse. And, questionless, these same conditions were the source of an age-long m&amp;ecirc;l&amp;eacute;e&amp;mdash;such as this week is, happily, impossible in any of our parishes&amp;mdash;wherein contended &amp;quot;courtesy, and humanity, friendliness, hardihood, love and friendship, and murder, hate, and virtue, and sin.&amp;quot; So that I can only counsel you to do after the excellencies and leave the iniquity." />
