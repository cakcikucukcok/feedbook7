  <title>The Edge of Innocence - David P. Miraldi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Edge of Innocence &lt;/em&gt;is a work of historical fiction based on the 1964 murder trial of Casper Bennett, a man accused of drowning his wife in a bathtub of scalding water in Lorain, Ohio.&amp;nbsp; Bennett&amp;rsquo;s sensational trial pitted an aggressive, mercurial county prosecutor against the author&amp;rsquo;s father, a civil trial attorney who had never defended anyone for murder.&amp;nbsp; The book not only recreates the tension and excitement of this courtroom battle, but also highlights the uncertain edge that often divides guilt from innocence.&lt;br /&gt;
The author was ten years old when he answered the phone late at night when Bennett called his father from jail, seeking his legal representation.&amp;nbsp; Forty years later and long after his father&amp;rsquo;s death, the author found the Bennett file buried in the bottom of his mother&amp;rsquo;s closet. From the moment he began reading the papers, the long-forgotten drama cast a spell on him.&amp;nbsp; As he uncovered more and more of the facts, the story he had known as a child disappeared, replaced by one far different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Edge of Innocence &lt;/em&gt;takes the reader through the criminal justice system and ultimately to the trial where the reader, like a juror, must sift through competing claims and conflicting evidence.&amp;nbsp; Full of twists and turns and colorful characters, &lt;em&gt;The Edge of Innocence &lt;/em&gt;is all the more entertaining because it tells a true story.&lt;br /&gt;
