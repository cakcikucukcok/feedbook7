  <title>Henderson&#39;s Spear - Ronald Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A masterly epic that weaves a contemporary search for a missing father with a vivid story from the heyday of the British Empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liv, a Canadian filmmaker, is writing from a Tahitian jail, piecing together her troubled past and her family&#39;s buried history for the unknown daughter she gave up at birth. The search for her own father, a pilot missing since the Korean War, has brought her to the South Seas and landed her behind bars on a trumped-up murder charge. In the stillness of her cell, Liv ponders the secret journal of her ancestor Frank Henderson, who came to these same waters a century before on an extraordinary three-year voyage with Queen Victoria&#39;s grandsons--Prince George (later George V) and Prince Eddy, who would die young and disgraced, linked by the gutter press to the Ripper killings and many other scandals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through unforgettable characters and a mesmerizing story, &lt;i&gt;Henderson&#39;s Spear &lt;/i&gt;traces two tales of obsession, intrigue, and loss--from the 1890s and the 1990s. These stories reach around the world from Africa, England, and North America to converge with compelling effect in the Polynesian islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a deep understanding of the landscape and culture of the South Sea Islands, Ronald Wright&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Henderson&#39;s Spear&lt;/i&gt; explores the patterns of history and the accidents of love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
