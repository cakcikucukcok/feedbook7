  <title>Only Killers and Thieves - Paul Howarth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;Barnes &amp;#38; Noble Discover Award Winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two brothers are exposed to the brutal realities of life and the seductive cruelty of power in this riveting debut novel&amp;#8212;a story of savagery and race, injustice and honor, set in the untamed frontier of 1880s Australia&amp;#8212;reminiscent of Philipp Meyer&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Son&lt;/em&gt; and the novels of Cormac McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An epic tale of revenge and survival, &lt;em&gt;Only Killers and Thieves&lt;/em&gt; is a gripping and utterly transporting debut, bringing to vivid life a colonial Australia that bears a striking resemblance to the American Wild West in its formative years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is 1885, and a crippling drought threatens to ruin the McBride family. Their land is parched, their cattle starving. When the rain finally comes, it is a miracle that renews their hope for survival. But returning home from an afternoon swimming at a remote waterhole filled by the downpour, fourteen-year-old Tommy and sixteen-year-old Billy meet with a shocking tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirsting for vengeance against the man they believe has wronged them&amp;#8212;their former Aboriginal stockman&amp;#8212;the distraught brothers turn to the ruthless and cunning John Sullivan, the wealthiest landowner in the region and their father&amp;#8217;s former employer. Sullivan gathers a posse led by the dangerous and fascinating Inspector Edmund Noone and his Queensland Native Police, an infamous arm of British colonial power charged with the &quot;dispersal&quot; of indigenous Australians to &quot;protect&quot; white settler rights. As they ride across the barren outback in pursuit, their harsh and horrifying journey will have a devastating impact on Tommy, tormenting him for the rest of his life&amp;#8212;and will hold enduring consequences for a young country struggling to come into its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recreating a period of Australian and British history as evocative and violent as the American frontier era, &lt;em&gt;Only Killers and Thieves&lt;/em&gt; is an unforgettable story of family, guilt, empire, race, manhood, and faith that combines the insightfulness of Philipp Meyer&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Son&lt;/em&gt;, the atmospheric beauty of Amanda Coplin&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Orchardist&lt;/em&gt;, and the raw storytelling power of Ian McGuire&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The North Water&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
