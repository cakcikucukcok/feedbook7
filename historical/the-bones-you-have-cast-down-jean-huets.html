  <title>The Bones You Have Cast Down - Jean Huets</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Inspired by a true story, &lt;em&gt;The Bones You Have Cast Down&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;will transport you to a medieval village and a lush&amp;nbsp;Renaissance court, to long ago times not unlike our own,&amp;nbsp;when the keepers of faith conspired against the faithful,&amp;nbsp;and the rich and powerful embraced war and corruption&amp;nbsp;even while fostering works of artistic brilliance revered to this day.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 1447, Taria is swept from a convent orphanage into the&amp;nbsp;glittering retinue of the duchess of Milan. Lowborn in a&amp;nbsp;highborn circle, she has never felt so alone. Then a small,&amp;nbsp;mysterious painting of a female pope carries her back 150&amp;nbsp;years to the joyous circle of a holy woman, worshipped in her&amp;nbsp;time, mysteriously obscure in Taria&amp;rsquo;s time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The duchess believes the journey is only a vision, yet she&amp;nbsp;orders Taria to learn more. Reviving the holy woman&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;fame could bring badly needed prestige to the noble family.&amp;nbsp;But Taria conceals &amp;nbsp;a devastating revelation: the saint and her followers are despised by the Inquisition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As jealousy wrecks her romance and poisons her closest&amp;nbsp;friendship, Taria shuns the present and embraces the holy&amp;nbsp;woman&amp;rsquo;s circle as the family she has always craved.&amp;nbsp;And the Inquisition closes in.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;PRAISE for THE BONES YOU HAVE CAST DOWN:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bones You Have Cast Down&lt;/em&gt; transported me to Italy at the dawn of the Renaissance, and into the heart of a young woman who&amp;rsquo;s deceptively quiet, extraordinarily spirited. From the hand-painted tarot cards to lavish festivities set amidst the misery of war, from cathedrals to village churches, Jean Huets brings alive this paradoxical time. &lt;em&gt;The Bones You Have Cast Down&lt;/em&gt; is enchanting and richly historical, as well as dazzling and dark, heart-wrenching and intoxicating.&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Stuart R. Kaplan, author of &lt;em&gt;The Encyclopedia of Tarot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A well written book with an intriguing story and an element of magic. Adults and teens alike will be drawn to this historical novel. &amp;mdash; Cary Meltzer Frostick, reviewer for&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;School Library Journal&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and&amp;nbsp;Youth Services librarian&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A storytelling treasure. Huets transports the reader into the mind of a young fifteenth century Italian with all the assurance and intimacy which one expects of a modern bard. The sights, smells, feel of Renaissance Italy seep from every pore of the story. The Inquisition lurks in the shadows. Speculative elements are deftly melded into the mix.&amp;hellip; Thought provoking as well as entertaining. &amp;mdash; Ron Andre, A Matter of Fancy&lt;/p&gt;" />
