  <title>Another Side of Paradise - Sally Koslow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1937 Hollywood, gossip columnist Sheilah Graham&amp;#8217;s star is on the rise, while literary wonder boy F. Scott Fitzgerald&amp;#8217;s career is slowly drowning in booze. But the once-famous author, desperate to make money penning scripts for the silver screen, is charismatic enough to attract the gorgeous Miss Graham, a woman who exposes the secrets of others while carefully guarding her own. Like Fitzgerald&amp;#8217;s hero Jay Gatsby, Graham has meticulously constructed a life far removed from the poverty of her childhood in London&amp;#8217;s slums. And like Gatsby, the onetime guttersnipe learned early how to use her charms to become a hardworking success; she is feted and feared by both the movie studios and their luminaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A notorious drunk famously married to the doomed Zelda, Fitzgerald fell hard for his &amp;#8220;Shielah&amp;#8221; (he never learned to spell her name), a shrewd yet softhearted woman&amp;#8212;both a fool for love and nobody&amp;#8217;s fool&amp;#8212;who would stay with him and help revive his career until his tragic death three years later. Working from Sheilah&amp;#8217;s memoirs, interviews, and letters, Sally Koslow revisits their scandalous love affair and Graham&amp;#8217;s dramatic transformation in London, bringing Graham and Fitzgerald gloriously to life with the color, glitter, magic, and passion of 1930s Hollywood. &lt;/p&gt;" />
