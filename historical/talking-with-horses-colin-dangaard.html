      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She falls in love with Zehun, a Lieutenant of Attila the Hun, while he saves her from savages who want her dead.  She returns the favor by saving Zehun seconds before he is sliced to pieces by Roman soldiers who have captured him. She places seven arrows into seven soldiers in as many seconds, shooting left and right handed with her bow. This happens in an action-packed fantasy world Emma Armbrust has created as a refuge from her autism.  In real life, her autism enables her to communicate with her jumping horse Tower, as people and horses did millions of years before.  Emma is 18 years old, tall, blonde and beautiful . She lives in the hills of Malibu, California, where she also falls in love with Jules , a troubled young man who is her age, and also a social outcast. There is just one problem. Zehun and Jules  look exactly alikethey just live 2,000 years apart. While Emma tries desperately to resolve her love triangle, she survives medication to make her normal and then rides Tower to National Grand Prix victory, thus saving the family horse ranch from bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
