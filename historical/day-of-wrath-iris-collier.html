  <title>Day of Wrath - Iris Collier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Peverell has returned to his manor house in Sussex after visiting King Henry VIII at court to find that his loyal steward has been murdered---strangled and thrown from the manor house tower. Nicholas immediately decides to launch an investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also has to deal with the unrest among the monks at his priory---King Henry is trying to reform the church and the plight of the monks is as yet unsure---could they somehow be involved? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicholas&#39; problems are further exacerbated when beautiful and talented local girl Jane Warrener tells him she has overheard talk of a conspiracy against the king. It is her notion that his steward&#39;s murder had something to do with it. Perhaps he overheard the conspirators and they killed him off before he could betray their plans. . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is the case, and with King Henry&#39;s untimely announcement of his intention to visit Peverell Manor on his way to Portsmouth in just a few days, Nicholas has no time to lose if he is to hunt down the murderous traitors and save the life of his king.&lt;/p&gt;" />
