  <title>Aunt Jane&#39;s Nieces at Millville - Edith Van Dyne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After months of travels and adventures that were recounted in previous books in the Aunt Jane&amp;#39;s Nieces series, the girls settle down for what they think will be a restful summer in a quaint rural village. But soon after their arrival, a number of unusual events transpire, and the girls soon find themselves embroiled in a confounding mystery.&lt;br /&gt;

L. Frank Baum (May 15, 1856 &amp;ndash; May 6, 1919) was an American author chiefly famous for his children&amp;#39;s books, particularly The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and its sequels. He wrote a total of 14 novels in the Oz series, plus 41 other novels, 83 short stories, over 200 poems, and at least 42 scripts. He made numerous attempts to bring his works to the stage and the nascent medium of film; the 1939 adaptation of the first Oz book would become a landmark of 20th century cinema. His works anticipated such century-later commonplaces as television, augmented reality, laptop computers (The Master Key), wireless telephones (Tik-Tok of Oz), women in high-risk and action-heavy occupations (Mary Louise in the Country), police corruption and false evidence (Phoebe Daring), and the ubiquity of advertising on clothing (Aunt Jane&amp;#39;s Nieces at Work)." />
