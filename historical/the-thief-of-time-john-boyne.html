  <title>The Thief of Time - John Boyne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;John Boyne has become internationally known for his acclaimed novels &lt;i&gt;Crippen &lt;/i&gt;and the bestselling &lt;i&gt;The Boy in the Striped Pajamas&lt;/i&gt;. Now, for the first time in the United States, comes the book that started the career of the author that the &lt;i&gt;Irish Examiner &lt;/i&gt;calls &quot;one of the best and original of the new generation of Irish writers.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is 1758 and Matthieu Zela is fleeing Paris after witnessing the murder of his mother and his stepfather&#39;s execution. Matthieu&#39;s life is characterized by one extraordinary fact: before the eighteenth century ends, he discovers that his body has stopped ageing. At the end of the twentieth century and the ripe old age of 256 he is suddenly forced to answer an uncomfortable question: what is the worth of immortality without love?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this carefully crafted novel, &lt;i&gt;The Thief of Time&lt;/i&gt;, John Boyne juxtaposes history and the buzz of the modern world, weaving together portraits of 1920s Hollywood, the Great Exhibition of 1851, the French Revolution, the Wall Street Crash, and other landmark events into one man&#39;s story of murder, love, and redemption.&lt;/p&gt;" />
