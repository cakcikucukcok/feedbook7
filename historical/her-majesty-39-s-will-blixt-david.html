&lt;br /&gt;
A very poor spy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
England, 1586. Swept up in the skirts of a mysterious stranger, Will Shakespeare becomes entangled in a deadly and hilarious misadventure as he accidentally uncovers the Babington Plot, an attempt to murder Queen Elizabeth herself. Aided by the mercurial wit of Kit Marlowe, Will enters London for the first time, chased by rebels, spies, his own government, his past, and a bear.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Through it all he demonstrates his loyalty and genius, proving himself to be - HER MAJESTY&amp;#39;S WILL.&lt;/p&gt;" />
