  <title>Night Calypso - Lawrence Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="LONGLISTED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL IMPAC DUBLIN LITERARY AWARD 1938 is a tumultuous year on the small Trinidadian island of El Caracol, which houses a leper colony and a convent. In the sultry heat of the dry season a young orphan, Theo, is sent to live with the island&#39;s doctor, Vincent Metivier. The doctor knows little of Theo&#39;s past, only that it has been troubled and that he now needs love and attention. As Theo settles into the rhythm of life in El Caracol, he begins to unburden himself of his demons. Every night, he sleeptalks his own strange, disturbing calypso about his childhood. Vincent listens and, gradually, learns what demons still haunt the boy&#39;s mind. And as his friendship with the passionate, unpredictable nurse Sister Weil intensifies, Vincent finds his settled life spirally dangerously out of control, as war in Europe looms on the horizon. A richly sensual, heartfelt novel, Night Calypso is the work of one of the world&#39;s most imaginative writers." />
