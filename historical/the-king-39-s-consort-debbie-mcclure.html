  <title>The King&#39;s Consort - Debbie McClure</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most little girls dream of marrying their Prince Charming and having the happy ever after, but what if the fables we&#39;ve been told don&#39;t tell the whole story? Born the illegitimate daughter of a seamstress in Denmark&#39;s mid-1800s, Louise Rasmussen rises to become a noted ballerina with the Royal Danish ballet, but getting pregnant with her own illegitimate child dashes her every hope and dream, forcing her to start a new life. Falling in love with Crowned Prince Frederik of Denmark should have made her life easier, but fate is fickle. Despite severe opposition from the nobility, Frederik weds Louise, the newly titled Countess Danner, soon after he is crowned King. Deeply in love, the two must fight to find some semblance of happiness in an environment that refuses to bend, and amid pending war and social turmoil, Louise and Frederik discover what is most important. Many claim she was a gold-digger, yet toward the end of her life, she creates Danner House, a home for unwed mothers and orphans, which still exists today." />
