  <title>The Path of the Hawk - Jeff Townsend</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The hawk was Cole Hawkins Indian totem, his naming clan. He always looked for them as he rode. Their presence brought him peace and the promise of prosperity. Coles journey begins when he is a young man. His travels take him from the battlefields of Waterloo, to England, and then, ultimately, to the foreign plains of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He begins his American adventure in New York but eventually finds his way to the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, following the course of the hawks that fly above. He meets many people over the course of his travels. The Native Americans seem welcoming and kind, but Cole is surprised to find whites suspicious and strange. Then again, people come in all sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cole is forced to grow up fast. He makes friends, meets women, and seeks his fortune in a new land. He is a brave adventurer, searching for a future in early nineteenth century America. He is not alone. There are many others who travel the same path. Through it all, Cole never forgets his namesake hawks that watch his every step from the sky.&lt;/p&gt;" />
