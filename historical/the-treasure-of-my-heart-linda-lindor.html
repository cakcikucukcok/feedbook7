  <title>The Treasure of My Heart - Linda Lindor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The land was Costa Rica; a place memories&lt;BR&gt;
The deep green silhouette of two giant mountains lay against the peaceful sky of late afternoon. The sunken valley cradles tales of many adventures and memories. The place is encamped by a range of mountains that lead to the pacific, but to follow her trail the traveler is indeed challenged by her never ending peaks. &lt;BR&gt;
Not far to the east, there is a volcano. Some say that they have seen both the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans from her heights; a sight to behold only on a bright, cloudless day. This giant forms a picturesque backdrop for the great valley. &lt;BR &gt;
Into the hills, one is drawn by the melody of a cascade whose song is thunderous in rainy winter months, and yet gentle and soothing in the dry summer heat. Then, the once lush green carpet turns to gold. &lt;BR&gt;
Along the stream runs a path that leads from a small bathing pool created by a dam of logs, to a rough cabin hidden in the woods. The sounds of children daily harmonize with the rivers tune especially in the heart of the summer vacations.&lt;BR&gt; 
The sounds were of joy, a happy song. They were the voices and laughter of three delightful youths
