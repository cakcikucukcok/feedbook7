  <title>Moonflower, Medicine Woman - Jerry D. Sisson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered what the American Continent was like before the Native Americans discovered that Columbus was lost? A time before alcohol, guns and other mechanized New World inventions. The horse came onto the scene with the arrival of the Spanish Explorers in the Sixteenth Century. Before the Natives were introduced to the horse, all travel was by walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though many Native tribes were highly sophisticated societies, technology was still very primitive. This story takes the reader to a time of scant historical traces left by a people who believed it was honorable to leave no footprints upon the Mother during ones lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story itself is an obscure legend that has had reality interwoven with folklore so as to duplicate as closely as possibly the life and times of these people whose culture was wonderfully rich and colorful.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This story tells of how the ancient peoples upon the Continent lived before recorded history. What they ate. What they believed in. How they survived. Their politics and social life. My goal is to create a feeling in my readers of having traveled to this interesting and intriguing time and place. To have met the characters in their own environment where they are dealing with their personal concerns and survival.&lt;/p&gt;" />
