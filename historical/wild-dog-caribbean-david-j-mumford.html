  <title>Wild Dog Caribbean - David J. Mumford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is early September 1973 and the archipelago of the Bahamas has just received its independence from England. After kicking the British out of the country and realizing the result is an overwhelming shortage of teachers, the Bahamian Ministry of Education turns to North America for help, sending advertisements for qualified teachers as far north as Northern Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buster Murdock, an adventurous, peace-loving young man fresh from graduate school, takes the bait. While lured to the magnetism of living in the Caribbean and its turquoise waters, Buster is also attracted to the idea of a quiet, peaceful island paradisea desire not unknown to many men from all walks of life. But as soon as his plane lands in Nassau, Busters dreams are quickly shattered by reality. While attempting to fit into the Bahamian culture and way of life, Buster must gain the respect of his pre-teen students, make friends with other teachers, and battle his way through loneliness. But when he finds what he hopes is love, Buster soon learns that life is unpredictable at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wild Dog Caribbean&lt;/i&gt; is the colorful tale of a restless American teacher who must survive outside the spheres of his old, accustomed environment and find a new normal while living and working amid an ever-changing 1970s Bahamian culture.&lt;/p&gt;" />
