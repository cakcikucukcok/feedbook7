  <title>Assignment Eire 1948 - Howard K. Storms</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Assignment Eire 1948&lt;/b&gt; is a complete story in itself, it forms the 2nd volume of Jack and Tess&#39;s adventures. The year is 1948, and Ireland is the setting for this escapade. Ireland is still smarting from the partition, but after leaving the Commonwealth and striving to finally emerge as the tiger it is today, one might say that 1948 was Ireland&#39;s rebirth.  If you can never get enough of that grand love affair with your Irish heritage, then you should add this thought provoking and stimulating story to your collection.  In this submission Jack and Tess are New York City Police Officers and are ordered to Ireland, to join the Garda to stop the weapons for drugs exchange with the New York City underworld and a loyalist splinter group.  They are innocently drawn into what is known as the troubles.  This creates a handicap for them as they try to accomplish their mission.  Tess&#39;s fondness for a garter belt holster, several life threatening shootouts, while being protected by a Seraph who must have smiled on their tender moments in a hay stack, invites one to follow along on their mission.  In bringing this second volume to fruition I must thank the critic&#39;s who commended my former work.  They have been more than kind, and for this I am profoundly grateful.  I have tried to make it as interesting as possible for the Irish it was written for, and for those who wish they were Irish.
