  <title>The Beginning of Spring - Penelope Fitzgerald, Andrew Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;Man Booker Prize Finalist: This &amp;ldquo;marvelous novel&amp;rdquo; about an abandoned husband, set in Moscow a century ago, is &amp;ldquo;bristling with wry comedy&amp;rdquo; (&lt;I&gt;Newsday&lt;/I&gt;).&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; March 1913. Moscow is stirring herself to meet the beginning of spring. English painter Frank Reid returns from work one night to find that his wife has gone away; no one knows where or why, or whether she&amp;rsquo;ll ever come back. All Frank knows for sure is that he is now alone and must find someone to care for his three young children.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; Into Frank&amp;rsquo;s life comes Lisa Ivanovna, a quiet, calming beauty from the country, untroubled to the point of seeming simple. But is she? And why has Frank&amp;rsquo;s bookkeeper, Selwyn Crane, gone to such lengths to bring these two together?&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; From a winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award, this novel, with a new introduction by Andrew Miller, author of &lt;I&gt;Pure&lt;/I&gt;, is filled with &amp;ldquo;writing so precise and lilting it can make you shiver&amp;rdquo; (&lt;I&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/I&gt;).&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;ldquo;Fitzgerald was the author of several slim, perfect novels. &lt;I&gt;The Blue Flower&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;The Beginning of Spring &lt;/I&gt;both had me abuzz for days the first time I read them. She was curiously perfect.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Teju Cole, author of &lt;I&gt;Open City&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
