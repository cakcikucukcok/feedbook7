  <title>The Bedouin - Joan H. Parks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After the great destruction which obliterated the palace cultures of Minos, Ugarit and many cities along the Mediterranean coast, the trade routes that connected the late Bronge age cities were disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in the late Bronze age of the ancient middle east, this set of stories follows the one family founded by Thutmose, the Egyptian artist. The kin, composed of warriors and traders, nurture and protect their beauty makers. They have been displaced many times by the wars and catastrophes, but always live close to or upon the trade routes that have still exist even in tumultuous times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 4, &lt;i&gt;The Bedouin&lt;/i&gt;, continues the story. Serena and Petros the Wise and their companions and family set out to the land of Thutmose to seek out and destroy the evil that lives there and menaces them. The Bedouin comes along with them on this mission, seeking revenge for the mistreating of the Arabian horses, the war mares. The Bedouin and his people are accepted as brothers by the kin, as the kin are accepted as brothers by the Bedouins tribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the long journey, many discoveries are made. Courage is doubted and confirmed in war fare, the young discover who have captured their hearts, the Bedouin learns to honor the women of his new friends, to respect the courage that they share with their men. The Egyptian descendents of Thutmose reconcile with the kin who live along the trade routes. All learn from each other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
