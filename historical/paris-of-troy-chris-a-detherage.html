  <title>Paris of Troy - Chris A. Detherage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Being the judge of a beauty contest between three goddesses isn&#39;t all it&#39;s cracked up to be. Yes, the goddesses are breathtakingly beautiful, and they each offer something of great value as a bribe to make the judge name her as the most beautiful, but they are awfully sore losers - and that can be downright hazardous to any mortal foolish enough to judge them. 
Meet Paris of Troy. A young man with abandonment issues, desperately trying to deal with the pressures of marriage and fatherhood,  until a trio of goddesses teach him what it really means to lose his mind. This wildly funny novel finally brings the Homeric legends into the realm of humorous fiction." />
