  <title>The Sleepwalkers&#39; Ballad - Yolanda Ortal-Miranda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; This story of love, idealism, courage and betrayals takes place against the turmoil of the end of Batistas government and first three years of Castros.  Besides the real-life characters of Batista, Castro and Che Guevara, the Revolution itself is an important character, making this work both a screenplay and a presentation of documented historical facts. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Riveting parts of this story include the attack on the Presidential Palace; the guerrilla presence in La Sierra; Castros victory; the Agrarian, Monetary, and Housing Reforms; the government takeover of all banks and private businesses; the emergence of a strong underground movement; and the Bay of Pigs Invasion, with the often glossed-over involvement of President Kennedy. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Much of the story is presented through unbiased dialogue and dramatizations of actual events. Two real-life characters, Echeverra and Manoln Guillotwho became significant figures in Cuban historyexemplify the struggle for freedom and justice against both regimes.   
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Parallel to the socio-political drama is the development of the love story between the two protagonists, Mara and Alfredo.  Alfredo believes in Castros promises of a just Revolution and joins Castro in La Sierra, rising to the rank of Comandante.  Disenchanted as he witnesses Castros dictatorial behavior once in power, e.g., appointing himself Prime Minister, removing President Urrutia from office, and betraying the promises of a just Agrarian Reform, Alfredo and Mara once again join an underground movement, now against Castro, with Manoln Guillot functioning as Chief of Intelligence of the MRR, the strongest anti-Castro movement in the Island.   
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After the failure of the invasion, Alfredo makes an unsuccessful attempt on Castros life.  Immediately imprisoned, Alfredo is submitted to endless tortures and humiliations, but he never reveals the identity of Carlos (one of the noms de guerre of Manoln Guillot).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end, a fascinating confrontation between the tyrant, Fidel Castro, and the idealistic Alfredo, reveals the strengths and flaws of two very different human beings.
