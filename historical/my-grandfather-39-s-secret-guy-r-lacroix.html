  <title>My Grandfather&#39;s Secret - Guy R. Lacroix</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    In the eyes of his grandson, Max, Roland Langevin is a hero who has always been silent about his war experiences. But while in the hospital undergoing
    cancer treatment, Roland is reminded by Max that it is the fifty-seventh anniversary of D-Day. Suddenly, Roland, who is overcome with emotion, is
    transported back in time to when he was an eighteen-year-old Canadian soldier landing in Northwest Europe to fight the Nazi regime. As Roland finally
    begins to share his memories with Max, his grandson has no idea that a painful secret is about to be revealed.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    It is 1943 when Roland presents himself to the Canadian Armys recruitment office with his best friend, Jean-Pierre Bernier, without any idea he has just
    signed up for hell. After he completes his training, Roland details to Max how he and Jean-Pierre headed to Europe, excited to beat the Nazis and Hitler.
    But as Roland tells Max how he bravely faced the worst atrocities of the war, he inadvertently reveals a painful secret. Max decides to investigate the
    secret, leading to an unforgettable reunion, linking the past with the present.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    In this historical tale, a Canadian veteran of WWII travels back in time to relay his personal story to his grandson. He soon discovers that love has the
    power to transcend time and even war. He is finally led to the answers he has been seeking for more than fifty years.
