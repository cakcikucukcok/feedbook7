  <title>Brass Bonanza Plays Again - Robert Muldoon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What happens when a major league pro sports team leaves a city? The Hartford Whalers left on April 13, 1997leaving behind devastated fans. The players left, tooexcept one who stayed and suffered like the fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiger Burns is an unlikely heroeven for a hobbit-sized, smash-faced, hockey goon with 600 fights. Standing 53, with one-eye, cauliflower ears, and a full-rigged ship tattoo on his chest, his most unusual feature is this: he loves Hartford and its team, the Whalers. In a league where players date super models, ice princesses and Miss Americas, he is a misfit. But in a league of Los Angeles, New York and Boston so is Hartford. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brass Bonanza Plays Again tells the riches-to-rags story of Mark Twains hometown, once the nations richest, now the butt of jokes. It relates the true saga of a small citys beloved team moved away, like Brooklyns Dodgers. And it weaves the tragicomic tale of the muscle-bound gnome who blows the jump-the-shark game against arch-rival Boston on April 11, 1990, lives homeless under a bridge, only to rise up and lead a dead team, out of the stands onto the ice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiger rallies not only a dead hockey team, but awakens the ghosts of Hartfords past. He brings to life a ragtag band of 19th century legends and is saved by a guardian angel Rube Waddell, one of sports goats from the 1905 World Series. Can a one-eyed, homeless underdog make a faded city believe and rescue a star-crossed spirit? In Brass Bonanza Plays Again, we have Rocky (on Skates!) meets Field of Dreams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rocky came out of a Philly row house, Rudy out of an Indiana steel mill, and now Tiger Burns comes out from under a Hartford bridge to bring a dead team to life. A book of provincial aspirations and condescension, Brass Bonanza Plays Again tells the story of this small city, midway between New York and Boston, long considered just a urine-stop or ass-wipe between Wall Street and Cape Cod. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times recently printed an essay In Search of the Great American Hockey Novel lamenting that hockey, unlike other sports, has yet to be celebrated in a notable work. Where is the Chekhov of the Chicago Blackhawks? the Times asks. Who is the Stendahl of the stick to the groin? To that, we humbly say: read on." />
