  <title>Jake &amp; Clara: Scandal, Politics, Hollywood and Murder - David R. Stokes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAKE &amp;amp; CLARA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is based on a true story about scandal, politics, Hollywood&amp;mdash;and murder&amp;mdash;from the dawn of the Jazz Age. When Warren Harding won the White House in 1920, his campaign received millions from Jake Hamon&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;The Oil King of Oklahoma.&amp;quot; Harding planned to make Jake the most powerful businessman in America. But Mrs. Harding (some called her &amp;quot;The Duchess&amp;quot;) had one condition&amp;mdash;Hamon, a married man, had to end his affair with his long-time mistress, a girl named Clara.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jake and Clara had been together for ten years, since she was seventeen and he was thirty-seven. But Jake coveted the powerful Washington job, and he dumped Clara a couple of weeks after Harding was elected.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A few days later, Clara shot Jake.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By the time Jake died, Clara was in the wind. A headline-grabbing national search was conducted for the beautiful fugitive. Clara &amp;ldquo;sightings&amp;rdquo; were reported far and wide. A pair of colorful lawmen found Clara in an unlikely hiding place and brought her back to Ardmore, Oklahoma to face the charge of first-degree murder. What followed was one of the most sensational murder trials of the era. A &amp;ldquo;dream team&amp;rdquo; of powerful lawyers surrounded Clara in the courtroom. Soon Hollywood came calling, wanting to put Clara&amp;rsquo;s story on the big screen&amp;hellip;starring Clara as herself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
