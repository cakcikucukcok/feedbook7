  <title>Paradise in Ruins - Antwyn Price</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On December 7, 1941, Japan devastated the US naval base at Pearl Harbor. While war had been raging in Europe and in Asia for years, this unprovoked attack drew the United States into the most disruptive and wasteful cataclysm in human historythe Second World War. While history books speak to the battles and historical figures pivotal to the outcome of the war, there were also ordinary peopleboth civilian and uniformedwho were propelled out of their comfort zones by unforeseen events and adventures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paradise in Ruins is a historical novel that unleashes an eclectic cast of characters who, tired of being constantly overlooked in World War II histories, finally have a chance to speak. Combining together a cast of civilian men and women, naval and military officers, and Pacific Islanders with the stories of real historical figures, author Antwyn Prices extensive research provides a compelling, personal view into the struggles and irrevocably changed lives of the men and women in the Asia-Pacific region before, during, and after the war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covering both the Nimitz and MacArthur campaigns from 1941 to 1946, stories about these lives will unfold from Canton Island to Sydney; from Pearl Harbor to Guam; from Espiritu Santo and Nouma to Guadalcanal and Bougainville; from New Guinea to the Philippines; and from Iwo Jima and Peleliu to Okinawa and Tokyo. Anyone curious about the Pacific War will be able to stitch the events together so that the geography, peoples, logistics, and strategies can be more easily understood.&lt;/p&gt;" />
