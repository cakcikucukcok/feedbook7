  <title>The Edge of Lost - Kristina McMorris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;An absorbing, addictive read&quot;--Beatriz Williams&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Will grab your heart on page one and won&#39;t let go until the end. I absolutely love this book, and so will you.&quot;--Sara Gruen, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Water for Elephants&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From bestselling author Kristina McMorris comes an ambitious and heartrending story of immigrants, deception, and second chances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a cold night in October 1937, searchlights cut through the darkness around Alcatraz. A prison guard&#39;s only daughter--one of the youngest civilians who lives on the island--has gone missing. Tending the warden&#39;s greenhouse, convicted bank robber Tommy Capello waits anxiously. Only he knows the truth about the little girl&#39;s whereabouts, and that both of their lives depend on the search&#39;s outcome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost two decades earlier and thousands of miles away, a young boy named Shanley Keagan ekes out a living as an aspiring vaudevillian in Dublin pubs. Talented and shrewd, Shan dreams of shedding his dingy existence and finding his real father in America. The chance finally comes to cross the Atlantic, but when tragedy strikes, Shan must summon all his ingenuity to forge a new life in a volatile and foreign world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Skillfully weaving these two stories, Kristina McMorris delivers a compelling novel that moves from Ireland to New York to San Francisco Bay. As her finely crafted characters discover the true nature of loyalty, sacrifice, and betrayal, they are forced to confront the lies we tell--and believe--in order to survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PRAISE FOR THE EDGE OF LOST&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Kristina McMorris takes us on a thrilling ride from the Emerald Isle, to the boroughs of New York, to the &#39;Rock&#39; of Alcatraz. I found myself thoroughly immersed in her richly evocative settings, just as I was captivated by the pure humanity of her characters as they struggled for redemption. This book is a wonderful read!&quot;--David Gillham, author of &lt;i&gt;City of Women&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I adore everything that Kristina McMorris writes and this book is no exception. &quot;--Jennifer Robson, author of &lt;i&gt;Somewhere in France&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A beautifully told story about a young man&amp;rsquo;s journey through adversity and loss with an exhilarating ending that I couldn&#39;t put down and stayed up well past my bedtime to finish.&quot;--Charles Belfoure, author of &lt;i&gt;The Paris Architect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Kristina McMorris evokes such a strong sense of place that to open her books feels less like reading and more like traveling. &amp;#160;Her absorbing new novel..[is an] epic, deeply felt tale of struggle and sec&amp;shy;ond chances&amp;hellip; a trans&amp;shy;porting piece of historical fiction.&quot;&lt;i&gt;--BookPage&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;[A] gripping immigrant saga&amp;hellip;it is also a portrait of America during a turbulent time and a quest that ends in triumph. Readers will be caught up in this well-told story. &quot;--&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews, &lt;/i&gt;4 Stars&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Beautifully written with mesmerizing details, this is one of those books that sticks with a reader&amp;hellip; extensively researched and the historical images are incredibly accurate&amp;hellip; an absolute must-have. &quot;--&lt;i&gt;VOYA Magazine &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;In terms of both the character and the era, McMorris took a chance, and she succeeded.

A satisfying read.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Kitsap Sun&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;McMorris manages to pack this book with all the messiness and nuances of a life. Her vivid descriptions and use of language make you feel like the fly on the wall...I heartily recommend embarking on this journey.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;The Daily Herald&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Grabs readers from the very start and doesn&#39;t let up until the dynamic conclusion. &lt;i&gt;The Edge of Lost&lt;/i&gt; is another work of genius by the talented Kristina McMorris.&quot;--Fresh Fiction" />
