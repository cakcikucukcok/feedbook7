  <title>Tales of Three Peninsulas and an Island - Gary Swagart, Drew Swagart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Tales of Three Peninsulas and an Island&lt;/i&gt;, Gary Swagart relates some stories about &quot;characters&quot; he has crossed paths with in &quot;the good old days.&quot; The setting of these tales is Isle Royale and three of Michigan&#39;s peninsulas: the Lower Peninsula, the Upper Peninsula, and the Keweenaw Peninsula, though most of them could have taken place wherever real &quot;characters&quot; are found which is basically anywhere there are people.&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His love of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Lake Superior, and Isle Royale, despite incidents that easily could have resulted in catastrophy, shows though. That love of this harsh, beautiful part of the world was shared by Yoopers like Old Drifter, who narrowly escaped the icy fingers of death, and the awesome Mr. S, a totally blind man, whose unique abilities and achievements were beyond belief.&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lower Peninsula of Michigan is beautiful in its own right with its rolling hills, farms and woodlands. Gary spent many pleasant hours hunting the wily rooster pheasant, deer, and &#39;coon there. Though, in general, Lower Peninsula residents (Trolls) have a slightly different perspective on many things than Yoopers, many &quot;characters&quot; reside there as well. The State Motto is &quot;If you seek a pleasant peninsula, look about you.&quot; The part about the pleasant peninsula could be replaced with &quot;some real characters&quot; and it would be just as true.&lt;p/&gt;" />
