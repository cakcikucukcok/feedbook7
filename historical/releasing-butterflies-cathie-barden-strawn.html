  <title>Releasing Butterflies - Cathie Barden Strawn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Robert Darden has just received the surprise of his life. As soon as the delivery room nurse announces he is the father of not one, but two babies, Robert can hardly believe his ears. As Robert and his second wife, Joy, and her two children, Shep and Shay, welcome the twins, Sarah and Sam, into the world, they have no idea of what awaits them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Joys doctor finds cancer during her post-birth visit, the Darden familys world is suddenly turned upside down. With four children, a new husband, and a new house, Joy is shaken to the core by the news. Determined to fight her terminal diagnosis, Joy has surgery and is thrilled when the doctors eventually tell her she is cancer-free. As the twins grow up, Robert becomes immersed in the darkness of alcoholism and begins abusing Joy and his children. As all become adversely affected by Roberts behavior, Joy finds refuge in Bible study classes and Shep embarks on a rebellious path. But when tragedy strikes the family repeatedly, grief replaces hopeuntil God shows all of them that He is a God of second chances and new dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Releasing Butterflies shares the tale of an ordinary familys journey in grief as they learn to trust Gods plan for each of them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
