  <title>A Spiritual Awakening - KayeLynn Grayce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    My spiritual awakening was not when I felt God while driving home with my little dog after spending the night in jail or when the young girl who never
    heard of AA showed up at a meeting and it turned out she lived in the state I had just moved from. Yes, those were spiritual experiences orchestrated by
    the mighty hand of God. But my awakening came when I began seeing the world through His eyes.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    God formed each cloud in the sky to be as uniquely beautiful as the people He created. He enabled the birds to sing in harmony as well as the Mormon
    Tabernacle Choir. Roses are red, violets are blue, and the grass is green because God painted them. Every sight, sound, smell, color, and texture you
    encounter originated from Him. The Creator of the universe handcrafted all of these for our pleasure so lets honor Him by enjoying them.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    I also discovered that the Bible is not a Whos-Who book of saints but story after story of real people who are as imperfect as you and I with the same
    real life issues that plague us today. And no matter what they did or how they acted there was no sin too big or bad to keep them from finding their
    connection to God. Perhaps youll find yours through one of them.
