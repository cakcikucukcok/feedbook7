  <title>Beyond the Wilds: Helena&#39;s Pursuit of Freedom - Mary Kolisnyk Spry-Myers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the 1800s, a European peasant desired freedom from his dominant, uncaring
landlord in Ukraine. He chose a new life and country for himself and his
family, immigrating to the wilds of Manitoba, Canada. The very primitive
lifestyle in the frontier wilderness of Canadian woodlands provided the
backdrop of the formidable challenges, difficulties and hardships he and his
family had experienced-through long years of adjustment-on the road to
survival and success. The story takes you on many interesting journeys,
across the sea, through time, to a conclusion. This saga tells a
heart-gripping human story embedded in history, exemplifying the courage and
strength of this family, and highlighting one particular individual, Helena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine, situated in Southeastern Europe, is about one-tenth the size of
Canada. Its countryside is very picturesque with abundant rich agricultural
land and has gained the reputation as the &quot;breadbasket&quot; of Europe. At the
height of feudalism until 1848, male peasants forced into serfdom were not
allowed to own land in Ukraine. After serfdom was abolished, most male
peasants were too poor financially to purchase land. One of them was a
Ukrainian peasant, Jacob, who found landlessness extremely depressing. His
landlord owned the land he and his family lived on. Jacob built the
dwellings on the land, but was unable to purchase the land. Jacob heard
about an offer from the Canadian government for Europeans willing to
purchase 160 acres of land for ten dollars. He decided to pursue the
opportunity, not realizing the difficulties and challenges he and his family
would have to go through in order to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mary experienced much anxiety during the journey by ship to Montreal.
Several of her children became ill. She also had many concerns about the
family&#39;s uncertain future in a new country. Mary&#39;s feelings of insecurity
grew during their wagon ride through miles of deep wooded area to reach
their new home. She took notice of the uninhabited territory for miles
around. Mary soon learned that children walked many miles through the woods
to attend school. Wild animals were close by. Temperatures went as low as
thirty to forty degrees below zero during the winter months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story expands on the eldest child, Michael, his marriage to Helena and
their family. Their first intimate relationship was on their wedding night.
It took place in a hayloft with the sound of cattle chewing and moving
around below them. Michael had a strong desire to own land before having
children. This desire was overtaken by the birth of their son, Bohdan, about
nine months following their marriage. Unfortunately, because a doctor was
not available in the area, the boy died from pneumonia at a very young age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael and Helena&#39;s family increased rapidly. Michael agreed to a
partnership with Helena&#39;s brother, Jack, over a down payment for a farm
estate. Michael was at first thrilled with this venture, but unfortunately
they experienced many years of financial depression. Jack decided to walk
away from the deal and left the farm to Michael. One of the highlights on
the farm Helena enjoyed the most was having a larger home for the children.
Her sister, Nellie, visited and stayed on for short periods, helping her
with the children. On one occasion, Nellie took care of the children while
Michael and Helena went out for a neighborhood get-together four miles from
their home. They traveled to their destination by horse and stone boat. The
ride home became a nightmare when Michael was not able to control the horse
with the reins. The horse finally stopped at the barn door. Michael was
astonished when he turned around to talk to Helena and realized she was no
longer with him. Where was she?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael&#39;s farming experience became more depressing as more payments were
deferred and obligations unmet.. During this very low period, Michael met an
