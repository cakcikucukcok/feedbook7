Can a fledgling nation bear the cost?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British forces advance upon a struggling colonial army. The time of decision has come. Declare independence, or give up the fight. The weight of a nation rests on Samuel Adams&amp;#39; shoulders as he joins the delegates of the Second Continental Congress. Can he raise the cause of Liberty above the fear of the King&amp;#39;s wrath in the hearts of his countrymen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three riveting short stories follow Samuel Adams as he struggles through the events surrounding the Declaration of Independence and evokes the Dawn of Liberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*******&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dawn of Liberty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberty hangs in the balance.

Samuel Adams is awakened by Revere&amp;#39;s cry of alarm. A large force of British soldiers are marching on Lexington to seize him and his compatriot, John Hancock. Adams and Hancock encourage the militia to make a stand against the Regulars, but should they stay and join the fight, or escape to safety?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travail of a Nation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samuel Adams felt the weight of the nation resting on his shoulders as he and his cousin entered the Pennsylvania State House. If the declaration did not pass today, their chances at ever truly gaining independence were all but lost. The British forces bound to arrive in New York any day would crush their revolution if it was not bolstered by a formal declaration.&lt;br /&gt;
