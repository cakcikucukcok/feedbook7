  <title>Well of Gold - Tom Richmond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Four University of Florida graduate students agree to spend summer in the darkest most inhospitable jungle on earth. They enter the Darin Gap in Panama in search of gold. They use a map discovered by Terry Marston, a graduate student. The map points the way, along with a letter verifying the existence of a well of gold left hidden by buccaneers in 1702.
These English buccaneers raiding out of Jamaica along with 70 black slaves, and 800 Indians forced Spaniards to surrender the Espiritu Santo gold mines in Cana. There they plundered the Kings stores of bullion awaiting shipment to Spain. Counterattacking the Spaniards captured the pirates and most of their army, but not before they hid the gold in a well.
Terry and his friends endure many hardships hacking their way to the hidden treasure. They encounter bandits, boars, crocs, jaguars, even narcotics traffickers in their quest. Eventually they discover man is their greatest adversary while seeking the gold hidden for more than 300 years.
If they prevail they will possess wealth beyond their wildest imaginings yet they must pit their skills against the chaos of nature and the greed of man. Ultimately, they discover the jungle takes no prisoners. Only one survivor will remember 911. That is Ecclesiastes 9:11.
I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill, but time and chance happeneth to them all." />
