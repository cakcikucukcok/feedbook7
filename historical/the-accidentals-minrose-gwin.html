Then, one fine day it jumps the track and crashes.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 1957, Olivia McAlister is living in Opelika, Mississippi, caring for her two girls, June and Grace, and her husband, Holly. She dreams of living a much larger life--seeing the world and returning to her wartime job at a landing boat factory in New Orleans. As she watches over the birds in her yard, Olivia feels like an &amp;#8220;accidental&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;a migratory bird blown off course. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Olivia becomes pregnant again, she makes a fateful decision, compelling Grace, June, and Holly to cope in different ways.

But the impact of Olivia&amp;#8217;s decision reverberates throughout Grace&amp;#8217;s and June&amp;#8217;s lives. Grace, caught up in an unconventional love affair, becomes one of the &amp;#8220;girls who went away&amp;#8221; to have a baby in secret. June, guilt-ridden for her part in exposing Grace&amp;#8217;s pregnancy, eventually makes an unhappy marriage. Meanwhile Ed Mae Johnson, an African-American care worker in a New Orleans orphanage, is drastically impacted by Grace&amp;#8217;s choices.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the years go by, their lives intersect in ways that reflect the unpredictable nature of bird flight that lands in accidental locations&amp;#8212;and the consolations of imperfect return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with tragedy, humor, joy, and the indomitable strength of women facing the constricted spaces of the 1950s and 60s, &lt;em&gt;The Accidentals&lt;/em&gt; is a poignant, timely novel that reminds us of the hope and consolation that can be found in unexpected landings.&lt;/p&gt;" />
