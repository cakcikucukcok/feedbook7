  <title>By Faith Isaac - Elsa Henderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Bibles great Faith Hall of Fame in Hebrews chapter 11 honours Abel, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham as outstanding examples of faith and identifies the acts that qualified them for this prestigious list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we read, By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future (Hebrews 11:20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merely speaking a blessing? How does this act rate alongside Noahs building the ark or Abrahams leaving his country?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thereby, believes Henderson, hangs a tale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first half of the book, By Faith Isaac, explores Abrahams faith journey and listens in to conversations between Abraham and Isaac as Abraham carefully passes on the faith lessons he has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Abraham faces his greatest faith test, the sacrifice of his son, Isaac embarks on his own faith journey. After marrying Rebekah, Isaac has to learn a new lesson of faithone which his forefathers had not had to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you love the Old Testament or struggle to read it, By Faith Isaac educates as it entertains, and at times borders on being devotional.&lt;/p&gt;" />
