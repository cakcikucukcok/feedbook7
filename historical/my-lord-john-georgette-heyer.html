Author Georgette Heyer intended this to be her magnum opus, but she had to keep interrupting the writing progress to write her Regency romances to satisfy the demands of fans and the tax office.<br /><b><i>My Lord John by Georgette Heyer - Goodreads</i></b> | Georgette Heyer died before the book was completed, leaving me wanting to know more about My Lord John. John was the third son of the Earl of Derby, later to be known as Henry Bolinbroke, who usurped the throne of England from his cousin, the very unstable Richard II.<br /><b><i>My Lord John: Heyer, Georgette, Dehn, Edmund ...</i></b> | My Lord John is an unfinished historical fiction novel by the British author Georgette Heyer, published posthumously in 1975 after her death the previous year.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>My Lord John - Georgette Heyer</a> </h3></p><hr/>
