  <title>Teacher Accused - Stephen Wzorek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story I am writing is true about a teacher and a family who have been tormented by corrupt lawmakers, an irresponsible educational administration, and ill-trained police detectives in the investigation of abuse involving autistic children.  Many of the names of the people, towns and organizations in this writing have been changed for obvious reasons.
This story is about my family.  This entire episode has taken a toll on my family and me for many years.
I am not quite sure if it is revenge that I desire, or just the idea that I want everyone to know the truth.
It is my expectation that there just has to be someone who would take a good look at those individuals in the educational, administration, and law enforcement fields who are abusing their authority in pretending to carry out their obligations.
I cant believe our forefathers meant for the lawyers, judges and others in the legal authority to utilize the legal system in the way I will demonstrate to you in this writing.
I find it amazing that the legal entities in our area seldom seem to have a real balance for truth. It doesnt matter what the actual facts are in a legal case.  What matters is who has the power to persuade the activities in their favor toward the end result.  Regrettably, too many times, it is the innocent who suffer." />
