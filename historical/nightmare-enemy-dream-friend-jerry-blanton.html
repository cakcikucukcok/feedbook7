  <title>Nightmare Enemy, Dream Friend - Jerry Blanton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As Luther Weitgucker grows up Protestant in early 1900s Dresden, he lives a charmed existence near the River Elbe, nursing little creatures and humans back to health. As his naturally inquisitive nature and desire to cure disease leads him to dream of becoming a doctor one day, Luther has no idea that a world war is looming in the near future that will change everything for him and everyone he loves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Nazi Party gains steam, Luther dives into his studies at the University of Bonn, marries his longtime girlfriend, Sigrid, and eventually focuses on fatherhood as his three sons are born. After Luther decides to join the military, he must not only survive the war but also keep his true views of the Nazis close to his chest. But as Luthers path crosses with those of his villainous foes, he is guided by his character to perform heroic feats that exceed expectations and shine a light on friendships that can survive even war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this military tale, a young German man enters the chaos of World War II where he must lead a U-boat crew while attempting to maintain his Christian faith, heal others, and love all as brothers and sisters.&lt;/p&gt;" />
