  <title>Serendipitous Rescue - Lowell Dunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It was a time before computers, cell phones, DVD&amp;#39;s or color television. Before microwave ovens, automatic doors, or diet sodas. Children played outside, and doctors made house calls. World War II had recently ended, and everyone was optimistic. These are the chronicles of Miss Nancy, JJ and Laddie, and others. It is a multi-generational story recounting the many ways in which accidental heroism begets more of the same, as kindness and rescue are paid forward across the decades. It&amp;#39;s also a story about people who struggled through World War I, the Great Depression and World War II. The heroes in this story are the many ordinary folks who made their era the &amp;quot;Greatest Generation.&amp;quot; The antagonist in this story is life itself. The backdrop of actual historical events portrayed here, along with historical figures of the era, are meant to be true and accurate. The characters themselves are fictional.&lt;/p&gt;" />
