  <title>From These Ashes Part Iii - T.E. Reynolds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Even in historys darkest times, enlightened men looked to the heart when choosing a friend. From These Ashes, is about a young man from Barnwell County, South Carolina who inherits 150 of his fellow human-beings. Part I, A Friend Loveth at All Times, speaks of the close relationships that existed on plantations between master and slave and the unrecognized struggle for freedom complicated by loyalty to a fair master.&lt;br /&gt;
Part II, A Brother Offended, continues the story through the war. The characters serve with the 2nd South Carolina Cavalry under Edgefields M.C. Butler - sharing in such adventures as Brandy Station, Hamptons cattle raid and the bitter return to South Carolina to fight against Kilpatricks Army, who gloried in burning a path from the low country to Columbia with more vengeance than Sherman dealt Georgia.&lt;br /&gt;
After the war, the main character returns home to find another challenge. Following true accounts of the Reconstruction, Part III, Through Wisdom is a House Built, places the characters into this agonizing time. In Part III, the main character does what he must to build a safe future for those he loves from the ashes left by Kilpatricks invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
From These Ashes celebrates positive qualities in men of both colors. Reynolds believes what we give our power over to will manifest. With this story he has chosen to celebrate the good in mankind - the good that was present then and is now. President Lincoln once said when meeting Harriet Beecher Stowe, So youre the little lady who wrote the book that started this great war! Reynolds shares a veiled history with a new generation of Americans. Knowledge brings understanding and understanding empathy. So with this tale his prayer is set free Let the South be free to celebrate her Confederate heritage." />
