  <title>Soulcatcher - Charles Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;Short stories inspired by the history of slavery in America, by the National Book Award&amp;ndash;winning author of &lt;I&gt;Middle Passage&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; Nothing has had as profound an effect on American life as slavery. For blacks and whites alike, the experience has left us with a conflicted and contradictory history. Now, famed novelist Charles Johnson, whose &lt;I&gt;Middle Passage&lt;/I&gt; won the National Book Award, presents a dozen tales of the effects and experience of slavery, each based on historical fact, and each about those Africans who arrived on our shores in shackles. From Martha Washington&amp;rsquo;s management of her slaves, bequeathed to her at the death of the first president, to a boy chained in the bowels of a ship plying the infamous passage from Africa to the South laden with human cargo, from a lynching in Indiana to a hunter of escaped slaves searching the Boston market for his quarry, from an early Quaker meeting exploring resettlement in Africa to the day after Emancipation&amp;mdash;the voices, terrors, and savagery of slavery come vividly and unforgettably to life.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;ldquo;[These] highly detailed short historical fictions bring to life this most shameful period in our nation&amp;rsquo;s history.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;I&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
