  <title>Chief White Eagle - L. S. Wood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is a joyful day when an infant boy is born into a free roaming tribe of Abnaki Indians residing in Vermont. As the village celebrates little White Eagles birth, a pair of unfriendly eyes watches from the distance and contemplates how to uproot the friendly tribe from their home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While White Eagle grows up in a loving family, the white man settles closer every day to their village, eventually forcing the tribe to move to a reservation governed by their race. As White Eagles journey eventually leads to become the one of tribes best hunters and the next-in-line to become chief, he finds love, marries, and sires a son. But when smallpox takes his family away forever, a devastated White Eagle buries them away from their village. Determined not to abandon them, White Eagle finds refuge from his troubles inside a nearby mountain cave and creates a solitary existence. As years and seasons pass, White Eagle quietly ages without any idea that he is about to finally realize his purpose in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this historical novel, an Abnaki Indian journeys through a challenging existence as he attempts to avoid capture by the white man and bravely confronts his destiny as life comes full circle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
