  <title>The Original Edison Field - Homer Wallop</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The baseball season of 1951 doesnt arrive soon enough for young Jimmy Fletcher, and the perfect refuge for this 10-yearold boy during that enchanted summer in the fictional town of Marshfield is transformed into The Original Edison Field. Thats where his dream of playing for the New York Yankees takes root. Unexpectedly, his quest ends all too soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, he becomes a successful journalist in a small town, but his life is unfulfilled. Then, a magical moment occurs: The daughter he never saw grow up reappears in his life. She has holes in her heart that need to be filled, just as Jimmy does. The improbable circumstances soon take another unexpected twist. He rediscovers his ability to pitch and an unlikely fantasy comes true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments before the final game of the 1993 season, Jimmy and his daughter run into a legendary player who instantly takes Jimmy back to 1951.&lt;/p&gt;" />
