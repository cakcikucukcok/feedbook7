  <title>Paw Prints Along the Rhine - Norman E. Stephenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Finally, due to great demand, the long awaited sequel to trilogy Paw Prints Through the Ages makes its appearance. This time our intrepid time traveling cat Beauregard and his friends time jump into the violent Burgundian/Swiss wars of the late 1400s. Their adventures in that period are as exciting and remarkable as
those they experienced during the crusades. Beau is his usual self, and his bonded human partner Ramn, his friends Raza and Alice,
and a few new characters, join him in taking part in and recording the true events of the Burgundian Wars. Like Norms previous
novels, this book is a blend of history, fantasy, and science fiction, which means the reader will never be bored. It is also, like all of his other works, a stand alone book, which means you do not have to have read the others to enjoy this one." />
