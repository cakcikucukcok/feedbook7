  <title>A Lady Of Expectations (Lester Family Saga) - Stephanie Laurens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Jack Lester has to find a bride. . .&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But where can he find the perfect woman? She has to be attractive, kind, a good conversationalist. . . and most important, she has to accept him as he is: devilishly handsome, charming and, as far as anyone knows, poor as a church mouse!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If London society discovers his hidden wealth, he&#39;ll never find the right wife. Jack&#39;s heart races when he first lays eyes on Sophie Winterton. She is everything he desires-and more-but he is caught in his own trap. Believing that Jack needs to marry into wealth, Sophie rejects all his advances, certain he would never marry a poor girl like her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As they play out a game of cat and mouse, can Jack convince her that she is the woman he wants-and that he is the husband she deserves?&lt;/p&gt;
