  <title>Man of the Sun - Mike Render</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is April 1944, and World War II is raging in Western Europe. Lieutenant Roy Stevens is an American P-51 Mustang fighter pilot who was just authorized to engage in all-out dogfights against the German Luftwaffe during his next assignment. On the eve of his mission, Roy writes letters to his girlfriend and family in Iowa without any idea that he will soon be led to uncover some of the wars darkest secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With orders to patrol the airspace over Cologne, Germany, Roy takes off in the darkness of early morning, prepared to do whatever it takes to defend his country. But when he is suddenly attacked from behind by a German fighter pilot, Roy bails out of his plane into enemy territory where he is quickly captured by German forces and made a prisoner of war. As dire circumstances and a moment of chance propel him to accepting his most important and challenging mission to date, Roy learns firsthand the significance of the bloody conflict as his fateand the fate of othersis changed forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Man of the Sun&lt;/i&gt; is the historical tale of an American airman during World War II as he bravely fights for his country, survives capture by the Germans, and ultimately gambles everything to save a young soul from a horrifying fate.&lt;/p&gt;" />
