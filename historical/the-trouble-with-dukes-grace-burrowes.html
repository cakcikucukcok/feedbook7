  <title>The Trouble with Dukes - Grace Burrowes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the beloved Windham series comes &quot;a wonderfully funny, moving romance,&quot; (Eloisa James) perfect for fans of &quot;sexy heroes, strong heroines, intelligent plots, [and] enchanting love stories&quot; (Mary Balogh).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; THEY CALL HIM THE DUKE OF MURDER...  The gossips whisper that the new Duke of Murdoch is a brute, a murderer, and even worse--a Scot. They say he should never be trusted alone with a woman. But Megan Windham sees in Hamish something different, someone different.&lt;br&gt;  No one was fiercer at war than Hamish MacHugh, though now the soldier faces a whole new battlefield: a London Season. To make his sisters happy, he&#39;ll take on any challenge--even letting their friend Miss Windham teach him to waltz. Megan isn&#39;t the least bit intimidated by his dark reputation, but Hamish senses that she&#39;s fighting battles of her own. For her, he&#39;ll become the warrior once more, and for her, he might just lose his heart.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
