  <title>Boudica, Queen of the Iceni - Marlene Sosebee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Two thousand years ago, the Roman Empire conquered most of Europe by slaughtering and enslaving millions of ancient Celts. All of Europe, from Britain to as far south as Italy and from what is now France, to as far east as Turkey, was all under Celtic rule. The Romans conquered these ancient Celts with superior military tactics and better weapons. When the Roman legions attacked a Celtic village, they would kill all the men, enslave the children and make whores of the women.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In 55BC, Julius Caesar invaded Britain for its wealth in copper and tin. The Britons, or ancient Celts, were made up of many tribes ruled by kings and queens. Unlike the Romans, Celtic women had as many rights as men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this remote island, the Romans decided to keep the villages in tact and create client kingdoms, taking half of every tribes wealth and production.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After the death of King Prasutagus, the Iceni tribe was left to his Queen Boudica. This was something the Romans could not except. For them, women had no right to own property for they were themselves, property to the Romans. When Queen Boudica stood up to the Romans, she was flogged and her two young daughters were raped. In 61 AD, Boudica led a revolt through, Camulodunum, Verulamium and what is now London, killing 70 thousand Romans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
