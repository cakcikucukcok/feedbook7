  <title>The Class of 1969 - Henry Rex Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 1965, and the Watts Riots have just ended when newlyweds Max and Jan King enter medical school. As Max and Jan converge with other students in the Los Angeles County medical complex, neither has any idea that their foray into the world of medicine is about to test their inner strength, perseverance, and activist views in more ways than they ever could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While civil unrest hangs over the country like a dark cloud, Max and Jan immerse themselves in their freshman year surrounded by cadavers, demanding professors, and chemistry labs. But the challenges of school soon threaten their happiness as a couple, unearthing a trove of doubt for Max, who is tempted to cheat not only in his marriage, but also on his exams. As Max grapples with an overwhelming fear of failure and the prospect of years of mind-numbing toil, he secretly wonders if the pursuit of prestige, affluence, and social status is really worth it after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this medical drama, Jan and Max are each drawn to help the world overcome the vast challenges of the 1960s. Now only time will tell if Max will ever be able to shed his ambivalence over his choice to become a doctor and embrace his chosen life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
