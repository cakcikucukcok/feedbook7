  <title>The World Beyond the Pale - Louise Cabral</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Esther Rabachs story begins in a Jewish shtetl (a small village) within the Pale of Settlement, an isolated area designated by Catherine the Great during her anti-Semitic rule of Russia. Esther, young and nave with a head full of romantic dreams, embarks on a journey to America to marry the man she loves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving in New York City in 1910, she discovers a world of ferment, chaos, and inequality known as the Sweatshop Era, where immigrants are exploited and abused. Experiencing these injustices first hand, Esther becomes a dedicated activist in the fight for an equitable America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louise Cabral, in her skillful writing, has accomplished a portrait of a womans transformation from innocence to true heroism. &lt;i&gt;The World Beyond the Pale&lt;/i&gt; will take the reader on a voyage between the devastation of the Old World and the hope for the New World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louise Cabral writes with the impassioned insight of a wise, true eldera quality age alone cant guarantee. She writes with a courageous heartwilling to be broken open for the sake of being filled. My heart and mind have been enriched by virtue of her literary gifts.&lt;br&gt;
Wayne Allen LeVine, author of &lt;i&gt;Insights of an Ordinary Man&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The World Beyond the Pale&lt;/i&gt; is an inspiring and uplifting story with a powerful female protagonist. I love Esther. All of the characters come to life through a realism that nothing is certain, all things change, and overcoming the obstacles is the triumph.&lt;br&gt;
Aurora Terrenus, author of &lt;i&gt;The Shroud of Sophia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The World Beyond the Pale&lt;/i&gt; captures your heart while it effortlessly feeds you historical bite after juicy historical bite. Through her compassionate words, Louise Cabral pays homage to the Jewish culture and brings life to a story that gives a voice to many who were silenced too soon.&lt;br&gt;
