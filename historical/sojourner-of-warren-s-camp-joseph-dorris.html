  <title>Sojourner of Warren’S Camp - Joseph Dorris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 1871 in Idaho Territory, and fourteen-year-old Samuel Chambers is, in many ways, already a man. After journeying west with his father in search of a golden ledge, Samuel ?nds himself living in the midst of a raucous mining camp ?lled with gold-hungry Chinese. Gold is scarce, and everyone wants itincluding Samuel, whose main goal in life is to get lucky rich. But Samuel has no idea that the path to achieving his dream is lined with danger like he has never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samuel refuses to believe all the naysayers as he embarks on a journey from placer mining to prospecting and from peddling merchandise to running assays. But life in the Wild West is unpredictable, and there are those so intent on ?nding riches that they will kill anyone who happens to get in their way. Even as danger lurks in the shadows, Samuel cannot keep his eyes o? Miss Lilly, a beautiful dancehall lady who intrigues him more than he would like to admit. Despite his attempts to balance a courtship with achieving his dream, nothing prepares Samuel for what is about to happen next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this compelling historical tale, a teenager on a coming-of-age journey in remote Idaho faces prejudice and peril as he struggles to carve a living from the land and build a new future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
