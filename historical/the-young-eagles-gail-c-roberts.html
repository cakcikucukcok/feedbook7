  <title>The Young Eagles - Gail C. Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Near the end of eighteenth century Russia as signs of increasing unrest and danger loom nearer every day for its royalty, a young nobleman leaves his betrothed behind and begins an unwelcome and perilous adventure. As Alexandr Barinsky and his guide journey to the wilds of a Turkmenian encampment to meet a leader instructed by his father to train him in the ways of the desert, all he wants to do is get back home in time for his bride-to-bes birthday ball. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After Alexandr and the Turkmen leader, Hakan, meet, the nobleman begins his training in a land where he must learn to cope with merciless mosquitos, poisonous snakes, crucifying heat, and his most dangerous enemy of all: man. Meanwhile his betrothed, Galena Lavaslav, is befriended by the beautiful widow, Countess Adrianna Batrakova. But just as Alexandr completes his long journey, no one realizes that a rider on a black horse is about to change everything for Countess Adrianna, the Barinskys, and the Lavaslavs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this historical tale, a young nobleman is led from the palatial castles of Kiev to Turkmenistan and back again as his betrothed, a powerful countess, and thousands of peasants attempt to find their place in life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
