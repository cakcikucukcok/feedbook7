  <title>To Capture What We Cannot Keep - Beatrice Colin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set against the construction of the Eiffel Tower, this novel charts the relationship between a young Scottish widow and a French engineer who, despite constraints of class and wealth, fall in love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 1887, Caitriona Wallace and Émile Nouguier meet in a hot air balloon, floating high above Paris, France--a moment of pure possibility. But back on firm ground, their vastly different social strata become clear. Cait is a widow who because of her precarious financial situation is forced to chaperone two wealthy Scottish charges. Émile is expected to take on the bourgeois stability of his family&#39;s business and choose a suitable wife. As the Eiffel Tower rises, a marvel of steel and air and light, the subject of extreme controversy and a symbol of the future, Cait and Émile must decide what their love is worth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seamlessly weaving historical detail and vivid invention, Beatrice Colin evokes the revolutionary time in which Cait and Émile live--one of corsets and secret trysts, duels and Bohemian independence, strict tradition and Impressionist experimentation. &lt;i&gt;To Capture What We Cannot Keep&lt;/i&gt;, stylish, provocative, and shimmering, raises probing questions about a woman&#39;s place in that world, the overarching reach of class distinctions, and the sacrifices love requires of us all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
