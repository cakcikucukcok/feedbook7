  <title>The Officers&#39; Club - Ralph Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Spring, 1981.  Vietnam is over, but the repercussions linger.  The military strives to recover as society reels from the excesses of the 1970s...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sinister beauty and a dutiful soldier... a Hollywood lawyer running from a dirty past and a cast-off vet who seems to have no future...  dueling drug gangs along the Mexican border... and the mutilated remains of a female lieutenant.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stunning, promiscuous, and brilliant at spotting the weaknesses in others, Jessie Lamoureaux may have been killed by a jealous lover, a drug smuggler--or a ghost from a life she hoped she had left behind.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was her murderer the Green Beret she betrayed?  The captain whose marriage she shattered?  The senior officer hoping to save her from herself?  A female sergeant fighting for dignity in a man&#39;s world?  Or a fellow lieutenant with a secret of his own?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this gritty tale of young men and women torn between the laws of the land and the laws of the heart, a dark journey leads from a moonlit beach in Mexico to mayhem in Iran--then back to a country looking for its soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Officers&#39; Club&lt;/i&gt; captures the passions and confusion of the times, the reckoning due after a decade of indulgence--and the commitment of those who stayed in uniform through the bad years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the military and society struggle to right themselves, their conflicts are embodied in the question:   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who killed Lieutenant Jessie Lamoureux?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
