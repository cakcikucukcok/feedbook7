  <title>Job&#39;s War - Cracker Irvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The perils on the trails West in the 1800&#39;s were many and often deadly. Besides the primitive living conditions, there were outlaws and racism to cope with along the way. Vigilante justice and racial prejudice were prevalent and practiced openly in many towns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job Irvin, being part Cherokee, finds himself a victim of social injustice because of his Native American apearance. Speaking good English and carrying American citizenship papers does little to dampen the the prejudice and hatred directed at anyone of color on the trail West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heroic rescue of Angie Cooper from a white slaver only complicates Job&#39;s trek West. A geniune romance develops between the two and Job realizes that Angie is to be the most important part of his future in Texas. He travels on alone to prepare a home for his future bride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifetime friendships are kindled on the wagon train that Job leads West to Texas. He learns that ignorance and apathy maintain the cruel mentality of prejudice and hate between the races of men. He decides to resist intolerance and speak out for equality of all men even though the consequences could be deadly. He tightens his cinch and extends his hand to others hoping his example will encourage others to pass it on!&lt;/p&gt;" />
