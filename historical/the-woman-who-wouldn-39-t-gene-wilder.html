  <title>The Woman Who Wouldn&#39;t - Gene Wilder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The beloved actor and screenwriter&#39;s second novel, set in 1903, stars a young concert violinist named Jeremy Webb, who one day goes from accomplished adagios with the Cleveland Orchestra to having a complete breakdown on stage.  If he hadn&#39;t poured a glass of water down the throat of a tuba, maybe he wouldn&#39;t have been sent to a health resort in Badenweiler, Germany.  But it&#39;s in that serene place that Jeremy meets Clara Mulpas, whom he tries his hardest to seduce.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clara is so beautiful that Jeremy finds it impossible to keep from trying to find a chink in her extraordinary reserve and elegance.  He finds himself reflexively flirting to get a reaction--after all, a tease and a wink have always worked before, with women back home.  But flirting probably isn&#39;t the best way to appeal to a woman who was married to a dumb brute and doesn&#39;t want to have anything more to do with men. Jeremy isn&#39;t sure how to press his case--but he won&#39;t give up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilder&#39;s prose is elegant, spare and affecting.  But it&#39;s his romantic&#39;s eye for the intense emotions that animate a real love story that makes &lt;i&gt;The Woman Who Wouldn&#39;t&lt;/i&gt; an unforgettable book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
