  <title>Hannah&#39;s   Search - Gil Balbuena Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hannah finds herself searching from an attic window for the man she planned to marry, but this time as a ghost. As the war escalates she can only watch as her family leaves the house and seek safe shelter away from the fighting along the river. Her new role as a ghost is often confusing as she moves between two different worlds; one she knows and misses terribly, and the other completely foreign to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannah learns to direct her powers to see things happening away from the house as well as making herself known to the current owners and some surprised guests at Loyalist House Bed and Breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this year at Loyalist House a winery is started. The trials of building and completing the bureaucratic red tape in order to operate have everyone in knots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Marilee and Jeannie as they, along with Hannah, search for Peter while keeping peace with the guests at Loyalist House.&lt;/p&gt;" />
