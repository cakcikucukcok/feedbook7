  <title>Love and Death in Bali - Vicki Baum, Nigel Barley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Set against  the  backdrop of the Dutch invasion of Bali just over a century ago, and the resulting &quot;mass suicides&quot; of the Balinese royalty, the moving story unfolds of the peasant Pak and his family and friends, and the tragedy that is their shared fate.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Written within living memory of the bloody events called the &lt;I&gt;puputan&lt;/I&gt; (the &quot;ending&quot;), &lt;I&gt;Love and Death in Bali&lt;/I&gt; is the story of a passionate yet peaceful and deeply spiritual people who defy the Dutch imperial forces through an act that would bring them certain death&amp;#8212;and certain rebirth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The looting of a Chinese trading ship gives the Dutch colonial forces the perfect excuse to intervene in island affairs, but they encounter astonishing resistance.  In the battle of Badung, wave upon wave of Balinese clothed in white ceremonial garb charged into the blazing Dutch guns, kris daggers in hand, prepared to die.  Who among them will survive, and how will their lives be forever changed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Love and Death in Bali&lt;/I&gt;, first published in German in 1937, is considered by many to be the finest novel ever written about this island paradise where everyone, regardless of caste of position, is woven into the fabric of an ancient culture.&lt;/div&gt;" />
