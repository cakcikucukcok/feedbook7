  <title>Peace In My Heart - Freda Lightfoot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Freda Lightfoot is back with a heartwarming story of life after the war.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;She must keep her family together… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The war is over and Evie Talbert eagerly awaits the return of her three children from their evacuated homes. But her carefree daughters and son are barely recognisable – their education has been disrupted, the siblings split up, and the effect on them has been life-changing. Her son has developed serious behavioural problems and with her daughters, there’s jealousy and a nervous disorder that cannot be explained…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Evie’s husband also has problems. Having returned from being in action, he suffers nightmares and fits of rage. He’s no longer the gentle, quiet man Evie married.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Peace may finally be here, but Evie’s family is in shreds. Now she must rebuild a loving home to achieve the happiness she’s always dreamed of…&lt;/p&gt;
