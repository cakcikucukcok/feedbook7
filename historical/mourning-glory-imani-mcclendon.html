  <title>Mourning Glory - Imani McClendon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="MOURNING GLORY
Daddy is facing a grand jury on three counts of statutory rape against my sisters, Aunt Bea is having his baby and he is having a stroke. He has never been committed, but by all normal standards he ought been. I mean  I swear he has got to be just a little bit insane. Annie Belle (my mom) probably dont know whether to pray for him or pull the plug. But, shes got her head stuck in the bottle; and whats that they say  the apple dont fall far from the tree? As much as I hated seeing her drink herself to death to numb the pain, Ive grown up self-medicating, and repeating the same mistakes, she made. She married Rupert, my daddy; I married Delbert, but the pain is the same. It only gets harder, the truth blacker and I  I stop fighting and go to wasting away, feeding on drugs to keep the ugly away. Hell, what am I supposed to do? Cause good fruit dont come from bad seed no ways; dats what Aunt Trudy always said and Aunt Trudy is a woman of God. But Ill be %#** Aunt Trudy, cause dem words keep me feeling worthless, like a thorn bush in a garden of morning glories. Im slipping; crumbling fast, like an old newspaper full of yesterdays news. And if I dont get hold to myself, um gon be yesterdays news; lost in a lousy legacy of lethargic rejects longing for answers in a line of dope or a loaded syringe.
COMMENTS FROM THE EDITOR
I found it to be a very moving and in fact, a haunting story. There is both humor and love, so it is not unmitigated. It reminds me of Dorothy Allisons, A Bastard Out of Carolina, in some ways. It is not that the story or characters resemble hers, but it is similar in telling a story that may be hard for people to hear. So many will feel that this story needs to be told." />
