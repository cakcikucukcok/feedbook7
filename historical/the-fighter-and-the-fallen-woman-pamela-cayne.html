      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;In this dark twist on Victorian romance, a champion fighter must risk it all for forbidden love and freedom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;em&gt;London, 1883&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;People like us don&amp;#39;t get happy endings.&amp;#34;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;In twelve years as a bangtail, Lady has never feared a man&amp;#39;s kiss. Owned by the ruthless Hannibal Adams, the &amp;#34;Earl of the East End,&amp;#34; she&amp;#39;s draped in jewels and dead inside. Lady learns fear, however, when she kisses Mr. Adams&amp;#39;s best fighter for luck&amp;#8212;for King sees the real woman locked away behind finery and falsity.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;King&amp;#39;s life is made of fists and scars, the only things that have ever felt real to him. Even his name came from the man who owns him&amp;#8212;the man who turned him into a champion. From the moment Lady&amp;#39;s kiss sends him reeling, King resists wanting what he can&amp;#39;t have. Mr. Adams never gives up what he owns.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;When Lady is sent to nurse King through the tournament, she finds a new strength through the one man who&amp;#39;s never treated her like a whore. King discovers that the woman who shares his dark world might also be the one to lead him out. And as the tournament comes to a violent finale, Lady and King must decide&amp;#8212;stay spoiled and shackled, or break free and risk what happens when fear and dreams collide.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;104,000 words" />
