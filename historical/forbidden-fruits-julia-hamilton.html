Held together by Sir Jack Macarthur, the patriarch called the &quot;Old Man,&quot; they build publishing empires, restore old buildings for the wealthy, teach at prestigious universities, and mingle with the wealthy, the stylish, and the powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Jack is on his deathbed, however, the family&#39;s success threatens to shatter as they learn that their well-kept secrets are about to be revealed by one of their own. Meanwhile, Ben Macarthur - the family&#39;s hapless architect - and his lover, Marianne Maclean - broken by a destructive affair with Luke Macarthur - find themselves swept up in the tide together . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A great read: Slick and quite sophisticated, this is at once poignant and hilarious.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;, starred review&lt;/p&gt;" />
