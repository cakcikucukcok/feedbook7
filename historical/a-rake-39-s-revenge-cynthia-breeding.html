  <title>A Rake&#39;s Revenge - Cynthia Breeding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After being abandoned by her almost-betrothed, Caroline Nash vows to never again get involved with a man. Especially not the middle-aged earl her father has chosen for her. The man is a pompous ass and one of Prinny&#39;s set who only wants her for her dowry. To complicate matters, a kiss from the Midnight Marauder unleashes an unbelievable passion that Caroline can&#39;t seem to forget. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephan, the Marquis of Kendrick, poses as the robbing marauder to avenge his low-born mother. But he starts questioning his plans when one of his &quot;missions&quot; crosses paths with Caroline and leads to the kiss of a lifetime. Stephan senses that this proper miss is more fiery than he expected and he wants more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be properly introduced to the woman of his dreams, he attends the Prince Regent&#39;s house party. He finds her, begging a friend to pretend to court her - to fend off the man her father has chosen. Stephan couldn&#39;t wish for a better opportunity - he&#39;ll happily court her, but he doesn&#39;t want to pretend. Their connection is sizzling, but can this charade become something real once Stephan&#39;s secrets are revealed? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Rake Trilogy series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* A Rake&#39;s Redemption&lt;br&gt;* A Rake&#39;s Revenge&lt;br&gt;* A Rake&#39;s Rebellion&lt;/p&gt;" />
