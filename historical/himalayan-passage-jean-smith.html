  <title>Himalayan Passage - Jean Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a sixteenth century Himalayan mountain girl, Tara knew a husband would be chosen for her. One day, Mughals riding sleek Arabian horses arrived seeking a woman prophesized to be one of the sultan&#39;s wives. Fear and excitement mingle in Tara&#39;s heart as she realizes she is the chosen one.&lt;p&gt;
Tara is taken to live in sultan Ibrahim&#39;s desert fortress. Since assuming power at eighteen, Ibrahim had established a vast empire where the arts flourished and religious tolerance meant peace. There, Tara joins Ibrahim&#39;s wives, each representing a region and religion, and quickly grows to love the exotic people and their rituals.&lt;p&gt;
Ibrahim is consumed by Tara&#39;s beauty and passion, and she quickly becomes his exclusive nightly companion. Tara&#39;s intelligence bonds her to Ibrahim&#39;s very first wife, Kiren. Together, Tara and Kiren serve Ibrahim, Tara as his lover and Kiren as his political advisor.&lt;p&gt;
As jealousy simmers among Ibrahim&#39;s wives, a southern governor, Bhaji, builds power by encouraging Hindu nationalism against Ibrahim&#39;s empire. Working against both time and karma, Tara, Kiren, and Ibrahim must devise a strategy to confront the tide of unrest. The task seems insurmountable as culture, religion, and ethnic politics collide in this riveting story of love, faith, and karmic tragedy." />
