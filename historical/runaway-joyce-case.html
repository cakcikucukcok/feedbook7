      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A head strong vivacious temptress in need......&lt;br&gt;
  A personal scout for Colonel George Washington hopelessly in love...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was 1754 and the French controlled the Ohio River Valley securing an alliance with the Indian six nations. The British are planning to move in and take over touching off the French and Indian War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sashsa Nicole Lorraine Dupris never expected to be right in the middle of the conflict. She was enjoying her status as the most available debutante of Montreal but was forced to run away from all she loved to daring adventures beyond her imagination. Rich by her birth right, she becomes involved and befriends many notable and famous people of her time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colton Tyler Gray, a Major in the Virginia Militia as personal scout to Colonel George Washington never expected to fall madly in love with a head strong, vivacious temptress who spurs his proposals. Sashsa is determined not to relinquish her hard earned independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destiny brings the two together to hunt for the persons bent on revenge.  Only Colton can unlock the tenderness and hidden passion in Sashsa, but it is not easy.  He vows she will be his. Once together, they build a dynasty that will live on in history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
