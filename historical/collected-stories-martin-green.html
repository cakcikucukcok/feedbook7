  <title>Collected Stories - Martin Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These 53 stories, divided into five sections, cover the span of a life from childhood to middle age, depicting experiences that all of us will recognize, especially the generation that grew up during the Depression years and came of age in the 1950&#39;s. In Growing Up in the Bronx, the experiences include desperately wanting a tricycle for Christmas, facing up to the school bully (&quot;The Fight&quot;), his &quot;First Kiss&quot; and first &quot;Betrayal.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Army Stories depict struggling for survival after being drafted during Korea (&quot;Dix&quot;) and New York Stories struggling to gain a foothold in the business world (&quot;Getting Started&quot;) as well as first love, or near-love, before the big decision to leave behind job, girl and (Jewish) mother to gain &quot;freedom&quot; in California (&quot;Good-bye New York&quot;).&lt;br&gt;
San Francisco stories chronicle the adventures, mostly misadventures, of young men on their own for the first time, a hopeless passion (&quot;Being in Love&quot;), an illicit affair (&quot;Party Time&quot;) and a decision to settle down (&quot;Going to Sacramento&quot;).&lt;br&gt;
In Sacramento Stories the focus shifts to marriage, children and work (&quot;Paying the Bills,&quot; &quot;The Promotion&quot;). The last story reflects on something we all must face, &quot;Mortality.&quot; &lt;/P&gt;" />
