  <title>Total War Rome: Destroy Carthage - David Gibbins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How far would you go for Rome?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carthage, 146 BC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the story of Fabius Petronius Secundus - Roman legionary and centurion - and of his general Scipio Aemilianus, and his rise to power: from his first battle against the Macedonians, that seals the fate of Alexander the Great&#39;s Empire, to total war in North Africa and the Siege of Carthage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scipio&#39;s success brings him admiration and respect, but also attracts greed and jealousy - for the closest allies can become the bitterest of enemies. And then there is the dark horse, Julia, of the Caesar family - in love with Scipio but betrothed to his rival Paullus - who causes a vicious feud. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately for Scipio it will come down to one question: how much is he prepared to sacrifice for his vision of Rome? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Total War: Rome II, from the bestselling Total War computer strategy game series, &lt;i&gt;Destroy Carthage &lt;/i&gt;is the first in an epic series of novels. Not only the tale of one man&#39;s fate, it is also a journey to the core of Roman times, through a world of extraordinary military tactics and political intrigue that Rome&#39;s warriors and citizens used to cheat death.&lt;/p&gt;" />
