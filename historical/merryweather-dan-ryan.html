One would become a United States Marine Corps General, the other an admiral in the United States Navy.  This book describes in vivid detail what may have occurred in the United States Marine Corps between 1837 and 1867. The narration is by the Marine Corps General, born in Port Royal, South Carolina.  He will serve in Florida during the Seminole Wars, Mexico, and finally the Civil War.  He is wounded at Gettysburg and is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.  He is promoted to Commandant of the Marine Corps and he occupies the highest USMC office in Washington D.C.  The historical events of 1937 through 1967, are carefully followed.  The imagination of the author provides rich characters in powerful settings from the battlefields of Mexico to those in America   The time old love story between a man and woman is woven throughout the book when the general meets the daughter of John Randolph Adams.  The Adams are those from the time of the Mayflower, two US Presidents and statesmen of America.  The general and Miss Adams are like oil and water.  He can not stand her, and she is convinced that this is the man she will marry.
	Scenes are set carefully with attention to accurate research of the low country of South Carolina as well as our Nation&#39;s Capital circa 1837 - 1867.  The People&#39;s Standard History of the United States written by Edward S. Ellis and published by Western Book Syndicate and copyrighted by the Woolfall Company have provided background materials, maps of the period and needed information on how the federal government was organized and functioned during this period of our history.
Dear Readers,
This is a story of Americas admirals and generals from 1833 to 1877.  These were trying times in the history of our country.  In 1822, a young man was accepted into the Carlisle Military College of South Carolina.  Another was accepted into the United States Military Academy at West Point.  One became an admiral, the other a general.  One lived in Port Royal, South Carolina, where he worked on his father&#39;s shrimp boats.  The other was born on a plantation south of Beaufort, South Carolina and sailed aboard his father&#39;s merchant ships, they were both in tune with the sea.  So when the two institutions asked for their selection of military service, they choose the Navy.  One became an admireal, the other a brigadier general in the United Staes Marine Corps.
This is a work of fiction.  Its location was inspired by my home which I leased on Dataw Island from 2003 through 2008.  The next barrier island in the chain is called Pollowanna Island and if was chosen as the fictional setting for the Caldwell family plantation.  To my knowledge, there was never a Cladwell living in Beaufort.  The fictional account is based, in part, on the lives of the Barnwell and Bull families who lived during these times.  They owned the homes described along Bay Street.  And, yes, they did have a Vice Admiral in the family.
The historical events which are outlined in this book all took place.  The dates and locations are accurate, but the characters are the products of my overactice imagination.  Some persons mentioned, however, are real.  You can not write about this period of our history without making reference to commanding admirals or generals.
Sincerely,
Dan Ryan" />
