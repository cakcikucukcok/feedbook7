&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Pugs are my life- and this is the best Pug companion you could possibly have if you truly want to maximize your Pug journey.&amp;quot; Ann Winters, Gatlinburg, TN.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Adorable Pugs pack a lot of personality into a small package.They&amp;rsquo;re very intelligent, extremely loyal, and don&amp;rsquo;t take up a lot of space. The fact that they&amp;rsquo;re also easy to groom and don&amp;rsquo;t have high exercise needs makes them the perfect pet for apartment living and other urban environments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike many breeds of dog, the Pug was bred purely to be a companion. This is one of the reasons they&amp;rsquo;re typically affectionate and loyal. Not to mention highly comical and entertaining! The laid-back Pug gets along just as well with other animals as it does with people, making it an ideal family pet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this guide, you will find a collection of invaluable advice about this wonderful breed: from spotting a healthy puppy and reputable breeder, to how to prepare your home for your Pug, how to make sure it grows up healthy into adulthood and into a great companion for you for the many years you&amp;rsquo;ll spend together. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All your questions will be answered such as &amp;ldquo;does the Pug get along well with other pets? What about children? Is excessive barking an issue? Where&amp;rsquo;s the best place to find the healthiest Pug with the best personality? How do I keep my Pug healthy? Should I breed my Pug? And, much, much more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All of the advice you need to understand the Pug and to care for it properly is waiting inside. So, what are you waiting for? &amp;nbsp;Keep reading to discover what makes the Pug so great!&lt;br /&gt;
