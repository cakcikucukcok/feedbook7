  <title>THE CREATION OF HAWAIKI - A Maori Creation Story - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 465&lt;br /&gt;
In this 465th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates a Maori Legend - &amp;quot;The Creation of Hawaiki&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE: &lt;i&gt;In M?ori mythology Hawaiki is the place where Io, the supreme being, created the world and its first people. It is the place from which each person comes, and it is where each will return after death.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE, UPON A TIME, a long, long time ago at the beginning of time was I-o, the great atua, the god-power, and the world was filled by Te-po-nui, the Great Darkness. Te-po-nui filled all the space, from the first space to the hundredth, to the thousandth space.&lt;br /&gt;
Then it was that the Atua commenced his great song of creation, and out of the Darkness sprang forth Life!&lt;br /&gt;
And out of the Darkness sprang forth Hine-nui-te-po! Then out of the same Darkness sprang forth Te Ao, the Light!&lt;br /&gt;
Then Te-Ao gave birth to Rangi! Rangi-nui, the great Heaven.&lt;br /&gt;
And again sang the atua his great song of creation, and out of Te-po-nui sprang forth Tangaroa, the God of the Oceans!&lt;br /&gt;
And again, out of Te-po-nui sprang forth Papa-tu-a-nuku, the far-stretching Earth.&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;
The Earth, and Rangi, the Heaven were created!&lt;br /&gt;
Rangi took Hine-nui-te-po for his wife, and their son was Ha-nui-o-rangi, the Great Breath of Heaven. And Ha-nui-o-rangi commenced his great movement, and forth sprang Tawhiri-matea, the father of the winds. And again Ha-nui-o-rangi commenced his great movement, and Te-ata-tuhi sprang forth, the First Glimmer of Light.&lt;br /&gt;
Great now was Rangi&amp;rsquo;s power, Rangi, the Creator! His eyes beheld with admiration Papa-tu-a-nuku, the far-stretching earth, shining forth out of the Darkness, and she was of great beauty. And Rangi made her his wife that together they might create Hawaiki, and their first son was Rehua.&lt;br /&gt;
What did Rangi and Papa-tu-a-nuku he have to do to create Hawaiki, the ancestral home of the Maori. Well, Did they succeed? &amp;nbsp;To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
