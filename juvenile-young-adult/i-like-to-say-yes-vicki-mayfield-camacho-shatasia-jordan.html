  <title>I Like to Say Yes - Vicki Mayfield Camacho, Shatasia Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Little ones love to express their opinions, especially when it comes to saying No! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In I Like to Say Yes, Vicki Mayfield Camacho leads children through a series of questions such as Do you like cake and Do you like to go to the playground? that instead encourage them to say yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an educator for over 35 years, I find this text unlimited in terms of the instructional avenues that can be explored with young children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristina Freedman, special educator and owner of Beyond Expectations Tutorial, Brookfield, CT &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am highly impressed with I Like to Say Yes. Its an easy, interactive book. A big hit at story time, and I recommend this book to parents and teachers for early readers and learners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Griffith, Librarian Two, Westchester Library System, Westchester, Westchester, NY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your book could be used as an early reader since there are predictable sentences and limited vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurie R Noe, chairperson of the behavioral and social sciences department professor of early childhood education, Housatonic Community College, Bridgeport, CT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Like to Say Yes is a perfect book for toddlers to emerging readers. The repetitive phrases and pictures makes it easy to read, and enjoyable. This book will have children wanting to shout out, Yes, yes, yes! &lt;/p&gt;
