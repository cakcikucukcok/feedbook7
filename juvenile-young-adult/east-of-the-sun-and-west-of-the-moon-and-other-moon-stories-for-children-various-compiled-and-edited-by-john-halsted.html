  <title>EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON and Other Moon Stories for Children - Various, Compiled and Edited by John Halsted</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Contained within this volume are the stories of &lt;i&gt;East of the Sun and West of the Moon, Monica the Moon Child&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Swan Maidens&lt;/i&gt; &amp;ndash; all classic children&amp;rsquo;s stories from yesteryear which, even today, children want to hear and read. Also included are two poems which relate to the moon - &lt;i&gt;The Man in the Moon&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Hey Diddle, Diddle&lt;/i&gt; &amp;ndash; which can also be considered classic children&amp;rsquo;s rhymes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While the stories are entertaining and enjoyable to read, the numerous illustrations will fire children&amp;rsquo;s imaginations and take them into fairy land, where, of course, anything is possible. Nowhere has this &amp;ldquo;firing of the imagination&amp;rdquo; been made more apparent than in the entertainments industry with the advent of Green Screen-CGI technology which has enabled big children&amp;rsquo;s imaginations to run wild and bring all sorts of apparitions to life - especially in the fairy and folk tales genre where we have seen a wholesome revival of interest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The most thoughtful, progressive educators and parents have come to recognize the cultural value of folklore and fairy tales, fables and legends, not only as means of fostering and directing the power of the child&amp;#39;s imagination, but as a basis for literary interpretation and appreciation throughout life not to mention increasing the literacy ability of children.&lt;br /&gt;
So, find that comfy chair, have your child snuggle in and set fire to their imagination with this short collection of &lt;i&gt;MOON STORIES for CHILDREN. &lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the profit from the sale of this book will be donated to charities,&lt;br /&gt;
