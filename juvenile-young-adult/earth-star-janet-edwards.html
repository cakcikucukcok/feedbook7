  <title>Earth Star - Janet Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Romance, science fiction, action, and a look at the false assumptions we make about others combine in this light-hearted, fun, and well-conceived science fiction future. Only She Can Save the World. Eighteen-year-old Jarra has a lot to prove. After being awarded one of the military&amp;rsquo;s highest honors for her role in a daring rescue attempt, she finds herself&amp;#8212;and her Ape status&amp;#8212;in the spotlight. Jarra is one of the unlucky few born with an immune system that cannot survive on other planets. Derided as an &amp;ldquo;ape&amp;rdquo;&amp;#8212;a &amp;ldquo;throwback&amp;rdquo;&amp;#8212;by the rest of the universe, she is on a mission to prove that Earth Girls are just as good as anyone else. Except now the planet she loves is under threat by what could be humanity&amp;rsquo;s first ever alien contact. Jarra&amp;rsquo;s bravery&amp;#8212;and specialist knowledge&amp;#8212;will once again be at the center of the maelstrom, but will the rest of the universe consider Earth worth fighting for?
