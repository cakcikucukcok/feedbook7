  <title>THE GIANT OF THE FLOOD - An ancient Sumerian/Babylonian Legend - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 242&lt;br /&gt;
In this 242nd issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the Sumerian/Babylonian story of &amp;ldquo;The Giant of the Flood&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
The foundations of ancient Chaldea, were laid as long ago as 5000 B.C. and were as early as those of ancient Egypt. In fact they were the sister colonies with a common cultural heritage. The earliest civilized inhabitants were Sumerians and the land was full of city-states. As with all great cultures they had many myths and legends. One of their legends is about THE GIANT OF THE FLOOD, and the story goes thus&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;
Just before the world was drowned all the animals gathered in front of the Ark and Father Noah carefully inspected them. Then he said to them &amp;quot;All you that enter and lie down shall be saved from the deluge that is about to destroy the world.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Then the various creatures began to march forward into the Ark. Father Noah watched them closely. He seemed troubled and wondered where if the unicorn would make it.&lt;br /&gt;
Og, a giant, not like by Noah offered to find it for him. But Noah turned down Og&amp;rsquo;s offer of assistance, considering Og to be one of the giants which were descended from Heaven&amp;rsquo;s fallen angels.&lt;br /&gt;
Then the rain started to fall when the time came the unicorn had not appeared and Noah was forced to shut the door of the ark. Og went and sat atop a mountain to wait out the deluge.&lt;br /&gt;
Did Og and the unicorn make it through the great flood? Well you&amp;rsquo;ll have to download the story to find out just what happened.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
