  <title>HOW THE SUMMER CAME - An Odjibwe Children&#39;s Tale - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 384&lt;br /&gt;
In this 384th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the American Indian Children&amp;rsquo;s Story &amp;quot;HOW THE SUMMER CAME&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is an Odjibwa tales about O-jeeg An-nung, or the Summer Maker. The Odjibwa calls a certain group of stars in the Northern sky &amp;ldquo;Ojeeg Annung&amp;rdquo;, meaning the Fisher Stars. It is in commemoration to this event that this tale relates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The tribal elders and learned men say that the earth&amp;rsquo;s present zones and climates do not correspond with those of old; that certain phenomena cannot be explained but by supposing, that the position of the earth in relation to the sun has, at sometime in the past, undergone a change. It is here that our story begins&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Morning Glory was tired of the winter, and longed for the spring to come. It seemed that Ka-bib-on-okka, the fierce old North Wind, did not want to go back to his home and had frozen the Big Sea-Water, Gitche Gumee, and covered it with snow.&lt;br /&gt;
Iagoo pointed out O-jeeg An-nung&amp;mdash;the Fisher stars. Morning Glory asked, &amp;ldquo;Why is O-jeeg An-nung laid out like that in the heavens?&amp;rdquo; Eagle Feather did not know so Iagoo began the story&amp;hellip;..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, just why were the Fisher stars laid out like that? What happened to cause this&amp;hellip;? Well many things actually, some silly and some serious. To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
