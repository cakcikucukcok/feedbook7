      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Itofit is a fantasy tale about three curious children who, after getting lost in the woods, meet a creature named It from the land of It. The Itofit is also lost. He cannot remember much from the past, and is trying to find his way back home. It is a perfect day for an adventure, so the children decide to help the Itofit, and together they all embark on a magical journey through woods, and swamps, and the amazing land of It. En route, they encounter strange opinionated and kooky characters, some of whom are quite horrific. Beside the Itofit and the children, are buoyant Baloomerangs who float on air, and curious Snigglesnorfs who sniggle - not to mention a dreadful district inquisitor, and the Durjge Dorque, both riding evil vegetable monsters. These devious people tangle with the children, leading them off into a series of adventures and misadventures.&lt;/p&gt;" />
