  <title>THE LOOT OF LOMA - An American Indian Children’s Story with a Moral - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 245&lt;br /&gt;
In this 245th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the story of &amp;ldquo;The Loot of Loma&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
Four tall men raid the hilltop town of Loma (somewhere on mainland USA). They set the town ablaze and loot the place of it&amp;rsquo;s riches.&lt;br /&gt;
Their return journey takes them over a treacherous mountain pass, where above them is only mountain and below them a seemingly bottomless gorge. One slip would have seen them fall to their doom.&lt;br /&gt;
At the zenith of their trail home they stopped and looked back at the now blazing hilltop town. A dread descends and they began to think that maybe they should not have looted the town&amp;rsquo;s temple. During their stop they pray to their totems.&lt;br /&gt;
After their prayer, buoyed by their success, they use bravado to brush off the feeling, calling it the &amp;ldquo;come down&amp;rdquo; after all the excitement of the raid and continue their journey home.&lt;br /&gt;
At the far end of the pass their wives wait their arrival with anticipation.&lt;br /&gt;
But will the men emerge from the pass? Will they make it through without mishap? Well, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to download and read this enlightening story with a moral to find out what happens in the end.&lt;br /&gt;
Be sure to read the story&amp;rsquo;s moral penned by none other than J K Rowling.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
33% of the profit from the sale of this book will be donated to charities.&lt;br /&gt;
INCLUDES LINKS TO DOWNLOAD 8 FREE STORIES&lt;br /&gt;
