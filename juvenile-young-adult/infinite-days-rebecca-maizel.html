  <title>Infinite Days - Rebecca Maizel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first in the delicious new Vampire Queen YA series, a tale that rewrites the rules of blood-sucking eternity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I never expected to be sixteen again...then again, I never expected my past to come back and haunt me . . .&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After centuries of terrorizing Europe as the world&#39;s most powerful vampire queen, Lenah is finally able to realize the dream all vampires have -- to be human again. After performing a dangerous ritual to restore her humanity, Lenah entered a century-long hibernation, leaving behind the wicked coven she ruled over and the eternal love, Rhode, who sacrificed himself in the ritual to grant her deepest wish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Lenah draws her first natural breath in centuries at Wickham Boarding School in Lover&#39;s Bay, Massachusetts, she rediscovers a human life that bears little resemblance to the one she had known. As if suddenly waking up a teenager isn&#39;t hard enough, she has to dress herself appropriately, go to class, and be gawked at as the beautiful new girl, all while learning her new human senses and weaknesses -- and trying not to fall in love with Justin, the most popular guy in school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And right when she thinks she has the hang of it, the worst happens: Her old life collides violently with her new one, making Lenah realize how attached she&#39;s become to her humanity. How can she choose between protecting her new friends and honoring her past?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Infinite Days&lt;/i&gt; is a wonderfully sexy, dark novel full of lush prose. Rebecca Maizel is a marvel, writing more than just a story, she creates myth with every page.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Carrie Jones, &lt;/i&gt;author of &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling series&lt;i&gt;, NEED&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
