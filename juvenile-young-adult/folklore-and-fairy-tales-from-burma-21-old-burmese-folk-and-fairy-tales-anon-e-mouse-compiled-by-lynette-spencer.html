  <title>FOLKLORE AND FAIRY TALES FROM BURMA - 21 Old Burmese Folk and Fairy tales - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled by Lynette Spencer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 21 colourful Burmese folk tales in this volume have been retold in English by teachers from the Phaung Daw Oo Monastic Education High School, Mandalay, Myanmar, formerly Burma.&amp;nbsp; Accompanying the stories are 22 illustrations created by their young pupils.&lt;br /&gt;
Herein you will find stories like The Crow Is As Proud As The Peacock&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; , The Three Sisters, The Blind Boy, Shin Mwe Lon And&amp;nbsp; Min Nanda, The Greedy King, A Disrespectful Daughter and many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As with most folk tales with Eastern origins, the stories have deeper meanings hidden beneath what, on the surface, may appear to be a simple story. &amp;nbsp;The morals in these Burmese tales often reoccur in the tales from other cultures&amp;rsquo;. Such universal themes include traditional family values and respect, still very much to the fore in a country that to a great extent has stood still in time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If, when view the images in this volume, you notice faint writing in the background. This is because the school is reusing old sheets of paper. Clean folio paper is expensive and not really in the school&amp;rsquo;s budget, so, purchasing a copy of this book will help the school to afford the basic equipment we take for granted in the West.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the net profit from the sale of this book will be donated to the &lt;b&gt;Phaung Daw Oo Monastic Education High School&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt; Mandalay&lt;/b&gt; to assist with teaching materials. These funds will assist the inspired school founders, Ven. U Nayaka and Ven. U Jotika, who, to date, have helped many underprivileged children benefit from a high standard of education.&lt;br /&gt;
