Standing together they had a chance to determine their own destiny, but apart there was little hope of escaping the tyranny of Casandras ghastly domination, and with Silver Citys queen lost in the storm, there was no one else who could convince the outlying colonies to stand against the two wicked sisters.   
    The termite queen couldnt do it, since she was a natural born enemy and no other ant held a high enough rank to address such issues with ruling monarchs.
