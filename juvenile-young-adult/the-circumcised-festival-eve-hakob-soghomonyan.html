  <title>The Circumcised. Festival Eve - Hakob Soghomonyan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The third book of the trilogy.&lt;br /&gt;
The Circumcised reveal themselves. They deliver a stroke and its wave spreads from the top of the Ararat, down its slopes and starts a massacre of the Turks and makes them run away in terror.&lt;br /&gt;
It is the same scene as during the Armenian Genocide in 1915, but the roles have changed.&lt;br /&gt;
The world confounded by the mysterious phenomenon explains it all as a result of some new-sprung disease, which they call the Turkish flu. Meanwhile, black holes appear in the biosphere. And energies of cosmic absolute evil and hostility penetrate into the Earth through those holes.&lt;br /&gt;
The crowd of pilgrims, in which all the characters have been involved for different and even contradictory reasons, head for the top of Mount Ararat and discover Noah&amp;rsquo;s Ark where a ritual action should be performed to save the Armenians from committing genocide and the Turks being subjected to genocide, and to save the entire humanity.&lt;br /&gt;
Repentance and forgiveness in one embodiment.&lt;br /&gt;
The novel is narrated in an unusual form. The author does not describe but gives a brief summary of the corresponding chapter.&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks to it the novel time thickens and speeds up, turns into future, passes ahead of the real time, guiding the development of which is one of the main tasks of the novel." />
