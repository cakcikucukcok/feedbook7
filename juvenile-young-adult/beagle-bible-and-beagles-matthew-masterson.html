  <title>Beagle Bible and Beagles - Matthew Masterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Beagle Bible and Beagles is an amazing Beagles resource, I find myself checking it over and over again!&amp;quot; - Miranda McIntyre, Nashville, TN.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Great Beagle guide the most breed-specific on Beagles I&amp;#39;ve found.&amp;quot; - Gloria Carson, Dallas, TX.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Beagles guide I was waiting for - thanks again!&amp;quot; - Patrick Page, Mesa, AZ.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Beagles are awesome and this guide makes them even more rewarding, I learned things I never knew about Beagles in just the first few pages- pick one up!&amp;quot; - Stephanie Carter, Raleigh, NC.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Beagles are the product of years of fine tuning and have left us with a breed that is alert, task-oriented, and focused, with enough stamina for the long chase&lt;/b&gt;. Beneath those floppy ears and big, brown, puppy-dog eyes is a hardy working dog who is ready for the hunt!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Beagles are good-natured and always seem to have a smile on their faces.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;As a whole, they are not aggressive or overly shy. Rather, they love the company of humans and make friends easily.Beagles were developed for flushing out small game animals, a task that requires them to be unwaveringly disciplined.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Beagles require a firm and commanding owner.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Lastly, Beagles are pack animals. They crave constant companionship and may develop separation anxiety when left alone too much.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Cute, smart, small, and active, the Beagle is an ideal family dog&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;that is great with children and full of energy. Beagles may be small in stature, but they are big on personality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Welcoming a Beagle into your home is an exciting time for both you and the pup.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;In no time, however, he will impress you with his intelligence, loyalty, and huge capacity to love.In this definitive Beagle guide, you will find the information you need to determine if the Beagle is the right dog for you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-You will also find helpful, breed specific information about caring for your Beagle as a puppy, as an adult, and as an aging dog,&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;including feeding guidelines, training tips, health advice, and pointers for keeping your Beagle happy and active.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-It also includes the history of the Beagle breed, information on showing your Beagle in dog shows, and techniques to curb negative behavior.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;All of the advice you need to understand the Beagle and to care for it properly is waiting inside.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
