  <title>The Secret of Glow Hill - Craig D. Burrus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you haven&#39;t met Chris and Luke yet, you&#39;re in for a wild ride! Their last adventure put them in a pretty &#39;hairy&#39; situation, leaving some unfinished business they need to take care of. &lt;i&gt;Shadow Lake&lt;/i&gt; was just the beginning. Now the boys must continue to piece together clues in hopes of understanding yet another of the area&#39;s most puzzling phenomenons, &lt;i&gt;Glow Hill&lt;/i&gt;. How it got its name is obvious, but what&#39;s behind it? Up to this point, no one could explain its existence, let alone gather the courage to go near it. That was before the &#39;Legend Busters&#39; put their heads together. 
&lt;p&gt;Join the young sleuths as they find themselves up to their necks in danger, strange characters and unbelievable circumstances. Are you up to the challenge? Come find out. Chris and Luke could certainly use some help uncovering &lt;i&gt;The Secret of Glow Hill&lt;/i&gt;." />
