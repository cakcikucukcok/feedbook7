  <title>TWO LEGENDS OF ARDMORE - Folklore from Co. Waterford, Ireland - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 413&lt;br /&gt;
In this 413th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates &amp;quot;TWO LEGENDS OF ARDMORE.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the first story Baba Indaba tells of St Declan&amp;rsquo;s, or St. Deglan&amp;rsquo;s, coming to Ireland and how the people of the place where he was tried to stop him leaving. But his followers rallied and gave St Declan his staff and told him what he must do with it.&lt;br /&gt;
Bit what was he supposed to do with it? Well, you will have to download and read this story to find out for yourselves!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second Legend of Ardmore is about the Tower of Armore which &amp;nbsp;stands today, like a silent sentinel on the &amp;quot;hill of the sheep.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
It tells of a little elf, in red jacket and green breeches who had been spending most of his days and some of his nights in the Tower of Ardmore working on a pair of riding boots for the fairy prince who wanted them by sunrise. Tap, tap, tap--goes the Leprechaun&amp;#39;s tiny hammer.&lt;br /&gt;
Before he knew it, the mists began to lighten and took on an orange glow as the sun began to rise over the horizon. But, had the elf finished his task&amp;hellip;..:&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Well many things happened, some silly and some serious. To find the answers to these questions, and others you will have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
