  <title>THE ISLANDS OF MAGIC - 34 children&#39;s fairy tales from the Azore Islands - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled by Elsie Spicer Eells, Illustrated by E. L. Brock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Out in the Atlantic Ocean, almost due west of the Pillars of Hercules, lie the Azore Islands. It is just possible that the Azores are all that remain of the fabled, ancient city of Atlantis; for how else would such a small chain of islands end up with such a rich tapestry of folklore and fairy tales. It is here that Elsie Spicer Eells found these tales and recorded them for us to enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;
In this volume of 34 illustrated children&amp;rsquo;s stories you will find tales like: &amp;nbsp;Princess Bluegreen of the Seven Cities, The Islands of Flowers, Why Dogs Sniff, The Princess Who Lost Her Rings, The Master Of Magic, St. Anthony&amp;#39;s Godchild, The Seven Enchanted Princes and many more. These stories will not be found in any traditional western fairy tale books. This makes these stories unique which will take children, and lovers of folklore, on a journey as yet untrodden by the majority.&lt;br /&gt;
So, we invite you to curl up with this unique sliver of Antlantean fairy culture, not seen in print for almost a century; and immerse yourself in the tales and fables of yesteryear.&lt;br /&gt;
