This is worse than algebra! Da Vinci was a futurist. He imagined the airplane, the helicopter, submarine, and more-long before anyone else. Who better to design a time machine to get Sam home?  Our time-traveler gets hooked on art and science as he gets to know Leonardo. Meanwhile, da Vinci is fascinated by the common items of 21st century life. Yellow highlighters are a revelation! There&#39;s plenty of intrigue along the way. Leonardo da Vinci&#39;s patron wants to keep the boy from the future, with all his knowledge, right in his court. And since time travel depends on being at the right place at the right moment, a breathless dash ensues with soldiers in hot pursuit.Sam would like to stay with his new friend, and Leonardo would like to see the future.  But the artist and man of science knows that each of us must make our world our own." />
