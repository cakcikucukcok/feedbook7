  <title>The Tears of the Rose - Jeffe  Kennedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three sisters. Motherless daughters of the high king. The eldest is the warrior-woman heir;the middle child is shy and full of witchy intuition;and the youngest, Princess Amelia, she is as beautiful as the sun and just as generous.&lt;P&gt;Ami met her Prince Charming and went away to his castle on the stormy sea-cliffs-and that should have been her happily ever after. Instead, her husband lies dead and a war rages. Her middle sister has been taken into a demon land, turned into a stranger. The priests and her father are revealing secrets and telling lies. And a power is rising in Ami, too, a power she hardly recognizes, to wield her beauty as a weapon, and her charm as a tool to deceive...&lt;P&gt;Amelia has never had to be anything but good and sweet and kind and lovely. But the chess game for the Twelve Kingdoms has swept her up in it, and she must make a gambit of her own. Can the prettiest princess become a pawn-or a queen? &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Praise for The Twelve Kingdoms&lt;/B&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;Well-written and swooningly romantic.&quot; -&lt;I&gt;Library Journal&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;starred review&lt;/I&gt;&lt;P&gt; &quot;Will captivate you from beginning to end with a richly detailed fantasy world.&quot; -&lt;I&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/I&gt;" />
