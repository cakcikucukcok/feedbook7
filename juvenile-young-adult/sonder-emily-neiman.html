      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Clara was six, a feeling washed over her that she would never forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a moment of epiphany for the young girl, the moment when she realized that every person she passed on the street had their own life, with their own problems to deal with. They were so much more than two-dimensional characters of her imagination; they were people, real people, with real lives, real families, and real problems.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It wasnt until she was much older that she learned this phenomena is known as sonder. The experience and the word would come to define her young life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As she grew into an observant and compassionate young woman, she too dealt with love, loss, heartbreak, and sorrow. But in taking the time to look beyond the surface, she also learned that the world is not as lonely as it once seemed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
