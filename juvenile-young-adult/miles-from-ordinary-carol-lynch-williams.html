  <title>Miles from Ordinary - Carol Lynch Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Imagine Anna Quindlen or Sue Miller turning her attention to writing a young adult novel, and you have an idea what [Williams] has done for early teen readers...&quot; --Audrey Couloumbis, author of the Newbery Honor Book &lt;i&gt;Getting Close to Baby&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Thirteen-year-old Lacey wakes to a beautiful summer morning excited to begin her new job at the library, just as her mother is supposed to start work at the grocery store. Lacey hopes that her mother&#39;s ghosts have finally been laid to rest; after all, she &lt;i&gt;seems &lt;/i&gt;so much better these days, and they really do need the money. But as the hours tick by and memories come flooding back, a day full of hope spins terrifyingly out of control....&lt;br&gt;&quot;No one can get inside the head and heart of a 13-year-old girl better than Carol Lynch Williams, and I mean no one,&quot; said James S. Jacobs, Professor of Children&#39;s Literature at Brigham Young University, of her breakout novel, &lt;i&gt;The Chosen One.&lt;/i&gt; Now this award-winning YA author brings us an equally gripping story of a girl who loves her mother, but must face the truth of what life with that mother means for both of them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
