  <title>Discoucia - Nicholas Lovelock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Revolution, romance and technological wonders are all in a day&#39;s work for the decorated hero of Alavonia, Sir Arthur Pageon. &lt;br&gt;An acclaimed explorer and inventor, Sir Arthur Pageon takes his unofficial role as defender of the realm of Alavonia very seriously. A fantastical world, Alavonia is home to the Discoucian Monarchy, as well as monstrous creatures and secretive academies for the highly gifted. &lt;br&gt;Upon returning from his most recent exploits aboard on his personal flying galleon The Nostradamus, Pageon is treated to a hero&#39;s welcome and celebratory procession through the streets of Alavonia&#39;s capital, Evermore. Little does Pageon know he&#39;s being followed by a mysterious group known as the Purple Guard, whose devious leader is his estranged sister, Queen Lily Pageon of Harrha Island. Fiercely intelligent, Lily specialises in dastardly technological inventions with the aim of bringing down the Discoucian Monarchy so that she may reign as its dictator. However, the heir to the throne is one Princess Josephine Olandine, whose youth and royal position masks her role in the Discoucian Secret Service.&lt;br&gt;Joining forces, Princess Josephine and Sir Arthur&#39;s adventures will take them across the whole of Alavonia - from the fog-bound shores of Karga, to the secret underground shanty town beneath the frozen prison of Icester, south to the verdant city of Proceur and from there to the affluent Starfall Academy - in their quest to foil Lily&#39;s revolutionary plans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
