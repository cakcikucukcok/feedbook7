  <title>The Stable - Sharon Feldt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the day faded into night, the animals were amazed that the little manger remained bathed in a beautiful soft light. There was no lantern in the stable, no hearth for a fire, and outside the stable the night was darkening. But inside, the face of the woman seemed to glow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man returned, and from the bundles they had carried prepared a small amount of bread and fruit for the woman. The donkey lay down close to his master, staring at the face of the woman. Something about her was very special, he sensed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Stable&lt;/i&gt; is an unusual Christmas story that shares the tale of more than one miracle that occurred on that holy night in Bethlehem. You will be left wondering what really happens in stables, barns, and pastures everywhere each Christmas Eve. This sweet story will bring a smile to every childs face, because they do believe in miracles.&lt;/p&gt;" />
