  <title>The Kingdom of Ning - B L Walker, Robin Roraback</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Kingdom of Ning is a bedtime read fantasy (4  8), thats fun for children and adults. Plus its a book to color!We meet a rare male calico cat in Story One. An orphan, Calico roams Ning, in a world older than Mother Earth, looking for food and friendship. He adopts a tough guy approach to life until he meets a dove, Coo, from The Kingdom of Snag. She shows him how terrific life can be if only he will lose the attitude. And further, a great horned owl, Hootie, teaches Calico a lesson about humility. In Story Two, we meet the new King of Ning during his glorious inaugural parade. Citizens and creatures from neighboring kingdoms come to strut their stuff. Calico and Coo become friends with the Kings pets, Snowflake and Minnie Dew. While visiting the Mountain people with his pets, he sets a skiing accident in motion, but Calico, Coo, and Hootie save the day and his skin. He is young and inexperienced, so the chubby King learns the hard way what it takes to become a benevolent leader. During the tales, Calico experiences the gamut of feelings from loneliness to pure joy.A mother said: My kids ask to hear these stories over and over, and they love to color the whimsical illustrations. Its a book youll want your kids to enjoy and talk about. Kim Donahue, Veterinarian Technician" />
