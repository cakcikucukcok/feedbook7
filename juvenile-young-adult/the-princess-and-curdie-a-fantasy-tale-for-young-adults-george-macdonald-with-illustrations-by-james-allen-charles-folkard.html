  <title>THE PRINCESS AND CURDIE - A Fantasy Tale for young Adults - George MacDonald, With Illustrations by James Allen &amp; Charles Folkard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Princess and Curdie is a children&amp;#39;s classic fantasy novel by George MacDonald from late 1883. The book is the sequel to The Princess and the Goblin and the adventure continues&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
Two years have passed since the last book, and Princess Irene and her father go to Gwyntystorm, while Curdie (a miner boy who is the friend of the Princess) stays at home with his mother and father.&lt;br /&gt;
A strange set of events leads Curdie to the castle. He is given a strange creature named &amp;nbsp;Lina to accompany him on his quest. Lina intervenes to save his life on more than one occasion.&lt;br /&gt;
At the castle he again meets Princess Irene. Curdie discovers the King in ill-health and also much skulduggery afoot in the castle, especially amongst the King&amp;rsquo;s most trusted advisors. Curdie and the Princess realise they must overthrow a set of corrupt ministers who are poisoning Irene&amp;#39;s father, the king. In addition the King of Borsagrass has invaded. But just who is going to defend the kingdom as the army and it&amp;rsquo;s leaders would rather see the King deposed??&lt;br /&gt;
