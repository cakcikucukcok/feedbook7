In issue 125 of the Baba Indaba Children&amp;#39;s Stories, Baba Indaba narrates the amazing tale Tom, abear, which lived in Paris. In about the 1830&amp;rsquo;s, a well-known artist named Alexandre-Gabriel D&amp;eacute;camps lived in Paris. He was the intimate friend of some of the finest authors, artists, and scientific men of the day, and was devotedly fond of animals of all sorts. He loved to paint them, and he kept quite a small m&amp;eacute;nagerie in his studio where a bear, a monkey, a tortoise, and a frog lived (more or less) in peace and harmony together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The bear&amp;rsquo;s name was &amp;lsquo;Tom,&amp;rsquo; the monkey was called &amp;lsquo;Jacko I.,&amp;rsquo; the frog was &amp;lsquo;Mademoiselle Camargo,&amp;rsquo; and the tortoise &amp;lsquo;Gazelle.&amp;rsquo; &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..We invite you to download and read the extraordinary story of Tom, the bear.........&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
