  <title>Explorer Academy: The Nebula Secret (Explorer Academy) - National Geographic Kids, Trudi Trueit</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Adventure, danger, and a thrilling global mission await 12-year-old Cruz Coronado as he joins an elite school for explorers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cruz leaves his tranquil home in Hawaii to join 23 talented kids from around the globe to train at the Explorer Academy with the world&#39;s leading scientists to become the next generation of great explorers. But for Cruz, there&#39;s more at stake. No sooner has he arrived at the Academy than he discovers that his family has a mysterious past with the organisation that could jeopardise his future. In the midst of codebreaking and cool classes, new friends and augmented-reality expeditions, Cruz must tackle the biggest question of all: Who is out to get him … and why?&lt;br /&gt;Readers can get in on the excitement with puzzles and codes embedded throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the help of his classmates, Cruz puts together pieces of a complicated puzzle. Suddenly, he finds himself at the centre of an international quest for a missing formula that only he can decode. By the time he boards the Academy&#39;s flagship Polaris for his semester at sea, the fate of his friends, and maybe even the world, are in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;
