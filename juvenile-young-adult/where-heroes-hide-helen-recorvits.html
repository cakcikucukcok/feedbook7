He&#39;d been a pilot, and Junior would like to know more about his wartime experiences, but his dad doesn&#39;t want to talk about the war and gets mad whenever the subject comes up. Plenty of other things make him angry, too, especially Junior&#39;s best friend, Lenny, a polio survivor. Even though Lenny is no longer contagious, Junior&#39;s father doesn&#39;t want his son taking any chances. Junior knows better and he&#39;s not going to let his father ruin his summer or his friendship. His dad comes close to doing both until something happens that shows everyone where heroes hide.&lt;/p&gt;" />
