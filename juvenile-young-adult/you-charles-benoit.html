This can&#39;t be happening to you. But then, how do you explain all the blood? How do you explain how you got here in the first place? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had to have been signs, had to have been some clues it was coming. Did you miss them, or ignore them? Maybe if you can figure out where it all went wrong, you can still make it right. Or is it already too late? Think fast, Kyle. Time&#39;s running out. How did this happen? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; is the riveting story of fifteen-year-old Kyle and the small choices he does and doesn&#39;t make that lead to his own destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his stunning young-adult debut, Charles Benoit mixes riveting tension with an insightful&amp;#8212;and unsettling&amp;#8212;portrait of an ordinary teen in a tale that is taut, powerful, and shattering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advance praise for &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; is authentic, ambitious, and gripping.
