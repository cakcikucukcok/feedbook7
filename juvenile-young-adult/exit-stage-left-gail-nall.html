  <title>Exit Stage Left - Gail Nall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this funny and sweet digital-original novel perfect for fans of &lt;em&gt;Fame&lt;/em&gt;, Casey works to find a new passion after her dreams of becoming a Broadway star are ruined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casey Fitzgerald has always been an actress. She&amp;#39;s known it was her destiny ever since she snagged the role of &amp;#34;apple&amp;#34; in her kindergarten&amp;#39;s production of &lt;em&gt;The Food Pyramid&lt;/em&gt;. But when she doesn&amp;#39;t get the lead in her performing arts high school&amp;#39;s production of &lt;em&gt;The Sound of Music&lt;/em&gt;, she begins to question everything. Not getting the lead means no recommendations, and no recommendations means she can kiss good-bye any chance of getting a scholarship to the prestigious New York College of Performing Arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some soul searching and some wise words from her friend Harrison, Casey decides to totally reinvent herself. She&amp;#39;s already ditched her on-again off-again boyfriend Trevor and is interested in the new boy at school, so why not start fresh with everything? But every new destiny she tries doesn&amp;#39;t seem quite right. And when her best friend, Amanda, who &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; get the lead, starts hanging out with Trevor, Casey&amp;#39;s not sure if she&amp;#39;ll ever be able to leave the drama behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epic Reads Impulse is a digital imprint with new releases each month.&lt;/p&gt;" />
