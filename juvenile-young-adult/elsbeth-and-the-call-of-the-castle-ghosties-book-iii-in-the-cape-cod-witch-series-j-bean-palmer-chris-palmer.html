  <title>ElsBeth and the Call of the Castle Ghosties, Book III in the Cape Cod Witch Series - J Bean Palmer, Chris Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Recipient of the prestigious Mom&amp;#39;s Choice Award honoring excellence, a Moonbeam Children&amp;#39;s Book Award medal winner and a 2015-2016 New Book Award winner, and described by Midwest Book Review as &amp;quot;about as fine a middle school fantasy as you could get: vivid, packed with ghosts and mystery, and yet tempered with an attention to interpersonal depth that is rare and inviting.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ElsBeth and the Call of the Castle Ghosties is set in the present on Cape Cod and the Scottish Highlands and is the coming-of-age tale of a young witch with a family legacy to protect the natural world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When their ancestral lands in the Highlands are threatened, three ancient ghosts of the castle need one of their clan from the living world. They call the young Cape witch across the sea. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ElsBeth has a personal calling to protect the natural world, and her own need to know more about the family line. Drawn deep into the present danger, and into the mysteries of the old country and of her family heritage, she is in well above her magic level. Includes seventeen original color illustrations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Storyteller Ink: &amp;quot;I want to very highly recommend ElsBeth and the Call of the Castle Ghosties. I found it humorous and entertaining. The story caught my interest quickly due to the character development. There is a sense of adventure, responsibility and fun in this book. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of my favorite things was the way the kids in the story worked together to understand and solve a problem, which helped others. I love stories that have a positive outcome due to the inventiveness and courage of kids! And this book is rich in this quality. Read it and spread the word. This one is really enjoyable!!!&amp;quot;" />
