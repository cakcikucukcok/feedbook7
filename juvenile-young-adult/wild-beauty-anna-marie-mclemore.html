Now, in &lt;i&gt;Wild Beauty, &lt;/i&gt;McLemore introduces a spellbinding setting and two characters who are drawn together by fate--and pulled apart by reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For nearly a century, the Nomeolvides women have tended the grounds of La Pradera, the lush estate gardens that enchant guests from around the world. They&#39;ve also hidden a tragic legacy: if they fall in love too deeply, their lovers vanish. But then, after generations of vanishings, a strange boy appears in the gardens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boy is a mystery to Estrella, the Nomeolvides girl who finds him, and to her family, but he&#39;s even more a mystery to himself; he knows nothing more about who he is or where he came from than his first name. As Estrella tries to help Fel piece together his unknown past, La Pradera leads them to secrets as dangerous as they are magical in this stunning exploration of love, loss, and family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
