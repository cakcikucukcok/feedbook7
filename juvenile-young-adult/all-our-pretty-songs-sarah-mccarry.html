  <title>All Our Pretty Songs - Sarah McCarry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;This is a story about love, but not the kind of love you think.  You&#39;ll see...&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lush and magical Pacific Northwest live two best friends who grew up like sisters: charismatic, mercurial, and beautiful Aurora, and the devoted, watchful narrator.  Each of them is incomplete without the other. But their unbreakable bond is challenged when a mysterious and gifted musician named Jack comes between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;His music is like nothing I have ever heard. It is like the ocean surging, the wind that blows across the open water, the far call of gulls.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, each girl must decide what matters most: friendship, or love. What both girls don&#39;t know is that the stakes are even higher than either of them could have imagined. They&#39;re not the only ones who have noticed Jack&#39;s gift; his music has awakened an ancient evil--and a world both above and below which may not be mythical at all.  &lt;I&gt;We have paved over the ancient world but that does not mean we have erased it. &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;The real &lt;I&gt;and the mystical; the romantic and the heartbreaking all begin to swirl together in &lt;I&gt;All Our Pretty Songs, &lt;/I&gt;Sarah McCarry&#39;s brilliant debut, carrying the two on journey that is both enthralling and terrifying. &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;And it&#39;s up to the narrator to protect the people she loves--if she can. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
