  <title>Return to Planet Tad - Tim Carvell, Doug Holgate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tad is back and he&amp;#39;s blogger than ever, in a laugh-out-loud sequel to the book Jon Stewart called &amp;#34;hilarious to anyone who ever went through, is currently in, might go to, or flunked out of middle school.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tad may have survived seventh grade, but his troubles are just getting started. From his first sort-of date (a disaster) to his first semiformal dance (a bigger disaster), all Tad wants to do is make it out of this year alive. But that&amp;#39;s not the only reason he keeps a blog. Tad also has a lot of important thoughts he needs to get off his chest, like: &lt;em&gt;I don&amp;#39;t get the phrase &amp;#34;you are what you eat.&amp;#34; It seems to me like the only people that&amp;#39;s true for are cannibals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This highly illustrated and hilarious book is by the Emmy&amp;#174; Award-winning head writer of &lt;em&gt;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&lt;/em&gt; and is based on a column in &lt;em&gt;MAD Magazine&lt;/em&gt;.
