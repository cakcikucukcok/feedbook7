  <title>Pumpkinny Tales - Loyd C. Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mr. Pumpkinhead is a mischievous pumpkin whose friends include many delightful farm animals. Throughout the book, the author uses clever animal names and noises that children are bound to relate to, repeat, and memorize.
Curiosity, hard-headedness, and a hearty spirit of adventure combine to put Mr. Pumpkinhead in slightly scary situations where he is forced to call upon his pumpkin seeds and some unusual pumpkin magic to get him out of trouble. In one adventure, when spur-of-the-moment planning doesnt work, Mr. Pumpkinhead and his pumpkin friends miss out on a special farmyard day. In the end, readers, along with Mr. Pumpkinhead, realize that it&#39;s best to follow good advice and think twice before setting out on what could be a dangerous or silly adventure.
While the main thrust of this book is to encourage wise decision making, demonstrations of friendship and sharing, woven throughout, will appeal to parents and children alike." />
