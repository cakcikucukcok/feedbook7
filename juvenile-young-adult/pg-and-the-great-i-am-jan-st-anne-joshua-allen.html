  <title>Pg and the Great I Am - Jan St. Anne, Joshua Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At some point, in our lives, most of us will question who, what and why we are.  
PG and the Great I AM addresses those questions through the story of a young squirrel who  goes through experiences similar to those of the human fledgling or even adult, for that matter.
Sometimes humorous sometimes adventurous but always searching for the One thing to give him the answer he seeks.   Other species offer their answers to only frighten or confuse PG and, just as he was about to give up, the answer comes.
Enjoy the trip with PG as he searches and finds that the answer has always been right there inside him.  
The Author hopes this story will entertain and enlighten children of all ages and those who read this book will be able to find the Great I AM within themselves." />
