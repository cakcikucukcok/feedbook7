  <title>The Winter People - Rebekah L. Purdy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Winter People by Rebekah L. Purdy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Salome Montgomery fears winter--the cold, the snow, the ice, but most of all, the frozen pond she fell through as a child. Haunted by the voices and images of the strange beings that pulled her to safety, she hasn&#39;t forgotten their warning to &quot;stay away.&quot; For eleven years, she has avoided the winter woods, the pond, and the darkness that lurks nearby. But when failing health takes her grandparents to Arizona, she is left in charge of maintaining their estate. This includes the &quot;special gifts&quot; that must be left at the back of the property.? ?&lt;br&gt;Salome discovers she&#39;s a key player in a world she&#39;s tried for years to avoid. At the center of this world is the strange and beautiful Nevin, who she finds trespassing on her family&#39;s property. Cursed with dark secrets and knowledge of the creatures in the woods, he takes Salome&#39;s life in a new direction. A direction where she&#39;ll have to decide between her longtime crush, Colton, who could cure her fear of winter. Or Nevin, who, along with an appointed bodyguard, Gareth, protects her from the darkness that swirls in the snowy backdrop. &lt;br&gt;An evil that, given the chance, will kill her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
