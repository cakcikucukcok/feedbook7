  <title>The Incorrigible Children of Ashton Place: Book III - Maryrose Wood, Jon Klassen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of especially naughty children it is sometimes said, &quot;They must have been raised by wolves.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Incorrigible children actually were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since returning from London, the  three Incorrigible children and their plucky governess, Miss Penelope Lumley, have been exceedingly busy. Despite their wolfish upbringing, the children have taken up bird-watching, with no unfortunate consequences&amp;#8212;yet. And a perplexing gift raises hard questions about how Penelope came to be left at the Swanburne Academy for Poor Bright Females and why her parents never bothered to return for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But hers is not the only family mystery to solve. When Lord Fredrick&#39;s long-absent mother arrives with the noted explorer Admiral Faucet, gruesome secrets tumble out of the Ashton family tree. And when the admiral&#39;s prized racing ostrich gets loose in the forest, it will take all the Incorrigibles&#39; skills to find her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hunt for the runaway ostrich is on. But Penelope is worried. Once back in the wild, will the children forget about books and poetry and go back to their howling, wolfish ways? What if they never want to come back to Ashton Place at all?&lt;/p&gt;" />
