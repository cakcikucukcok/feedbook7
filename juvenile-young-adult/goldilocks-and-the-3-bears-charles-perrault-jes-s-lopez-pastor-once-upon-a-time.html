One day, as she was wandering in the forest, she discovered a beautiful cottage that seemed to be empty. Goldilocks, very curious, decided to come into the house and visit the different rooms. Exhausted, she ended up sleeping in one of the beds.

Her name was Goldilocks. One day, however, as the curious little girl wandered into the forest, she got lost. She found a little cottage and went to look inside. As no one answered the door and seeing no one inside while peeking through the windows, she decided to enter into the cottage. Inside, Goldilocks saw three bowls of porridge still steaming on the kitchen table. They all had different sizes: a big one, a medium one and a small one! As she was quite hungry from her walk through the forest, she took the small bowl without any hesitation and ate the porridge avidly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the same collection:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Thumbelina&lt;br&gt;• The Ugly Duckling&lt;br&gt;• The Brave Little Tailor&lt;br&gt;• The Tin Soldier&lt;br&gt;• The Musicians of Bremen&lt;br&gt;• Hansel and Gretel&lt;br&gt;• Three Little Pigs&lt;br&gt;• Beauty and the Beast&lt;br&gt;• The Little Thumb&lt;br&gt;• Puss in Boots&lt;br&gt;• Little Red Riding Hood&lt;br&gt;• Sleeping Beauty&lt;br&gt;• Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&lt;br&gt;• Cinderella&lt;br&gt;• Peter Pan" />
