  <title>Zombie Tag - Hannah Moskowitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wil is desperate for his older brother to come back from the dead. But the thing about zombies is . . they don&#39;t exactly make the best siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirteen-year-old Wil Lowenstein copes with his brother&#39;s death by focusing on Zombie Tag, a mafia/&lt;br&gt;capture the flag hybrid game where he and his friends fight off brain-eating zombies with their mothers&#39; spatulas. What Wil doesn&#39;t tell anybody is that if he could bring his dead brother back as a zombie, he would in a heartbeat. But when Wil finds a way to summon all the dead within five miles, he&#39;s surprised to discover that his back-from-the-dead brother is emotionless and distant.  &lt;br&gt;In her first novel for younger readers, Moskowitz offers a funny and heartfelt look at how one boy deals with change, loss, and the complicated relationship between brothers.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Zombie Tag - Hannah Moskowitz</i></b> | Zombie Tag is a cute but bittersweet middle grade novel by Hannah Moskowitz. Will's older brother Graham died approximately 6 months before from an acute asthma attack. Wil and his parents haven't been doing very well since. Wil invented a game called zombie tag in an effort to learn how to battle zombies. I loved this book.<br /><b><i>Zombie Tag by Hannah Moskowitz - Goodreads</i></b> | ~ Hannah Moskowitz, Zombie Tag "Talking to you is like talking to myself." ~ Hannah Moskowitz, Zombie Tag (This is a truism for ALL brothers in the throes of their child years together. It's a shame we forget it when we grow up.) ZOMBIE TAG has very little to do with zombies. Don't tell Hannah Moskowitz I said that. I will deny it vehemently.<br /><b><i>Zombie Tag: Moskowitz, Hannah: 9781596437203: Amazon.com ...</i></b> | Hannah Moskowitz is the author of Invincible Summer and Break, an ALA popular paperback for Young Adults. Hannah's YA novels were sold at auction the same day she began her freshman year of college. Zombie Tag is her first middle grade novel.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Zombie Tag - Hannah Moskowitz</a> </h3></p><hr/>
