  <title>Counterfeit Detectives - Mary Dixon, David Krumboltz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Scooter Kane is not your typical detective.  No rough scraggly beard or run down office in the tough section of town.  No messy desk with coffee mug rings and week-old newspapers.  In fact, theres no office at all.  And unlike some traditional detectives, Scooter is busy.  He cant even remember when he wasnt working on a case.  He hasnt solved any mysteries yet, but then hes only ten years old.
In Counterfeit Detectives, a kick-the-can game starts an adventure of mystery, suspense, terror and humor as brother and sister work to solve a case that has foiled the professionals.  Set in a small mid-western city, Scooter and his twelve-year old sister, Mary, discover a box of counterfeit money.  But it disappears before they can show it to their doubting father.  Because of their tricks in the past, their parents dont believe them, thinking this is just the latest in a series of pranks.
Counterfeit Detectives was written to be read and enjoyed by pre-teens.  However, parents and grandparents will find this is a story they actually enjoy reading aloud to younger children, as there are some valuable lessons involving right and wrong, helping others, and the acceptance of different people.  Sprinkled though out with humor that both children and grown-ups will enjoy, this is the first in a series that follow Scooter and Mary as they solve the crime that stumped the experts." />
