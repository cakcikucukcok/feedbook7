      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;When things don&#39;t turn out as Gigi planned, Dad helps Gigi understand that we each have unique, God-given gifts.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;When Gigi and her best friend, Frances, try out for The Purple Ponies soccer team, the competition is stiff. DiscouragedBut Dad helps a discouraged Gigi learn that everyone has certain talents and perhaps her talents don&#39;t include soccer. As it turns out, Frances makes the team but wants to wait until next year because it wouldn&#39;t be as much fun without her best friend on the team. After some royal thinking, Gigi comes decides they both can be part of the Purple Ponies. Frances plays on the team and Gigi becomes a cheerleader for the team. It&#39;s a delightful story that shows God has given each of us different abilities, and we need to use them to the best of our ability.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Scripture theme: &lt;EM&gt;We all have different gifts. Each gift came because of the grace God gave us. &lt;/EM&gt;--Romans 12:6&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
