  <title>Voyage of the Defiance - S.E. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An act of defiance that will either kill her or change her life forever&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sixteen year old Makayla Summerlin&amp;#39;s life with her drug-addled mom and skeezy boyfriend was hard, really hard, but it was hers! She barely remembers the grandfather she now has to live with. Completely uprooted, Makayla feels exactly how little control she has over anything &amp;ndash; until she looks at her grandfather&amp;#39;s sailboat and suddenly it seems like the perfect escape from her life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Makayla sets sail &amp;ndash; with an unintended passenger &amp;ndash; and begins a journey around the coast of Florida that will challenge everything she has ever believed about herself. What will it take to survive the elements?&lt;br /&gt;
