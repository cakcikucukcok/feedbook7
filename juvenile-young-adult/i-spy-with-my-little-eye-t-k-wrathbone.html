&lt;br /&gt;
I Spy With My Little Eye&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blake Williamson wants he and his friends to become the new One Direction, but Melissa, a scowling stepmother who wants nothing to do with her stepson, banishes Blake and his friends to the attic with the warning; If he wants to sing and dance, he must clean out the attic and use it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Spending hours cleaning and dusting, Blake discovers long-lost treasures and photos of happier times just a few short years ago. And then a strange thing happens&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A hole emerges through the adjoining wall, and unable to contain their curiosity, Blake and his friends peer through, only to find very strange things indeed&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An ominous green glow emanates through the hole and they see arms and blood flying through the air. But Blake&amp;rsquo;s not sure if he&amp;rsquo;s seeing things or just not being told the truth&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All he wants is for his mother to come back to him, and the neighbours say they can make it happen, but they want his stepmother in return&amp;hellip;" />
