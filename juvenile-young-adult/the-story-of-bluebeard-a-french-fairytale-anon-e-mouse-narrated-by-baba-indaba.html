  <title>THE STORY OF BLUEBEARD - A French Fairytale - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 458&lt;br /&gt;
In this 458th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the classic fairy tale - &amp;quot;The Story of Bluebeard&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE, UPON A TIME, a long, long time ago and far, far away in France lived a wealthy nobleman named Bluebeard. He is wealthy and powerful, yet frighteningly ugly, nobleman who has been married several times to beautiful women who have all mysteriously vanished. When Bluebeard visits his neighbour and asks to marry one of his daughters, the girls are terrified. After hosting a wonderful banquet, he chooses the youngest daughter to be his wife - against her will - and she goes to live with him in his rich and luxurious palace in the countryside, away from her family.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bluebeard announces that he must leave for the country and gives the keys of the ch&amp;acirc;teau (castle) to his wife. She is able to open any door in the house with them, each of which contain some of his riches, except for an underground chamber that he strictly forbids her to enter lest she suffer his wrath. He then goes away and leaves the house and the keys in her hands. She invites her sister, Anne, and her friends and cousins over for a party. However, she is eventually overcome with the desire to see what the forbidden room holds, and she sneaks away from the party and ventures into the room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Did Bluebeard know that she had opened the forbidden door? What happened to the beautiful, young wife? Will she, too, mysteriously disappear? To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;

Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
