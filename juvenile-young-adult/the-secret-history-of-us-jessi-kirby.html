  <title>The Secret History of Us - Jessi Kirby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Jessi Kirby&amp;#8217;s books just keep getting better and better, and &lt;em&gt;The Secret History of Us&lt;/em&gt; is her best yet. It beautifully touches on all the most important things in life&amp;#8212;love, family, friendship, memory, and bacon.

She figures it&amp;#8217;s because she was in a coma for a week, but as time goes on, she realizes she&amp;#8217;s lost more than just the last week of her life&amp;#8212;she&amp;#8217;s lost all memory of events that happened years ago. Gone is any recollection of starting or graduating high school; the prom; or her steady boyfriend Matt. Trying to figure out who she is feels impossible when everyone keeps telling her who she &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Liv tries to sort out her family and friends&amp;#8217; perceptions of her, the one person she hasn&amp;#8217;t heard enough from is Walker, the guy who saved her the night her car was knocked off that bridge into the bay below. Walker is the hardened boy who&amp;#8217;s been keeping his distance and the one person that has made Liv feel like her old self&amp;#8230;whoever that is. With feelings growing for Walker, tensions rising with Matt, and secrets she can&amp;#8217;t help but feel are being kept from her, Olivia must find her place in a life she doesn&amp;#8217;t remember living.&lt;/p&gt;" />
