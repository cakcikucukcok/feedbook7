      <meta name="description" content="It was a crisp autumn day, and Justins mother had promised him a trip to the library. As they drove along the narrow winding road toward town, Justin drank in the brilliance of the golden afternoon. Fiery leaves glittered as they spun lazily to the earth. The creek seemed to sparkle like a golden topaz as it caught the reflections of autumn. Something dark and speckled suddenly caught Justins eye. He was certain that the roundish rock lying on the side of the road had not been there before. Was it his imagination, or did it move ever so slightly?" />
