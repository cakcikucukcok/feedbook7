  <title>Seriously Hexed - Tina Connolly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tina Connolly continues the hilarious adventures of teen witch Camellia and her mother, wicked witch Sarmine, in &lt;i&gt;Seriously Hexed&lt;/i&gt;, this latest installment to the Andre Norton Award-nominated &quot;Seriously Wicked&quot; series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teen witch Cam has resigned herself to being a witch. Sort of. She&#39;s willing to do small things, like magically help her boyfriend Devon get over his ongoing stage fright. But tangling with other witches is not on her wishlist. Joining her mother&#39;s wicked witch coven is right out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New acquaintance Poppy Jones is a Type A, A+ Student of True Witchery. She&#39;s got all the answers, and she&#39;s delighted to tangle with a bunch of wicked witches. She  doesn&#39;t need any reluctant witch getting in her way, especially one who knows less than a dozen spells, and has zero plans for witch college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then a coven meeting goes drastically awry. A hex is taking down all thirteen members of the coven, one by one--putting both girls&#39; mothers in jeopardy. Now the two teens are going to have to learn to work together, while simultaneously juggling werewolf puppies, celebrity demons, thirteen nasty hexes, and even nastier witches. They may have to go through hell and high water to save their mothers--but they also might find a new friendship along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
