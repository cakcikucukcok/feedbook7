  <title>Hummingbird - Kimberly Greene Angle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twelve-year-old March Anne Tanner&#39;s life is tied to the simple rhythms and cycles of the watermelon farm in Jubilee, Georgia, that she has grown up on. Thanks to Grenna, her grandmother and surrogate mother, March Anne has learned everything she needs to know about seeds, vine pruning, and harvesting melons and pumpkins. And although Grenna has tried to teach March Anne about her ancestors, March Anne has always been uncomfortable with the family name she&#39;s been given and doesn&#39;t like. And so, in secret meetings deep in the woods, March Anne and her two best friends form the Pseudonymphs, whose names change with the seasons. &lt;br&gt;When Grenna suffers a heart attack, March Anne must face an uncertain future and confront her past. In the middle of it all, a ruby-throated hummingbird decides to winter at the Tanners&#39; and becomes a source of delight and inspiration as March Anne prepares for Grenna&#39;s passing and journeys toward self-acceptance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sweet and tangy debut introduces a memorable cast of characters who come to learn that grace can abide within and beyond the realities of pain and loss.&lt;/p&gt;" />
