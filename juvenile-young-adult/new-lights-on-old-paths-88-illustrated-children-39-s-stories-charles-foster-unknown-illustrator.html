  <title>NEW LIGHTS ON OLD PATHS - 88 illustrated children&#39;s stories - Charles Foster, Unknown Illustrator</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein are 88 illustrated short stories for children with most of the stories suffixed by a moral. In this volume you will find stories like:&lt;br /&gt;
The Innkeeper&lt;br /&gt;
The Brook and the Waterwheel&lt;br /&gt;
Crooked Horn and Old Brindle&lt;br /&gt;
The Lark and the Whippoorwill&lt;br /&gt;
The Weedy Farm&lt;br /&gt;
The Learned Owl&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;hellip;.and many, many more.&lt;br /&gt;
Even as long ago as 1888, Charles Foster believed that it is not new truths that we need, but the application of old ones to our daily life, which led to the title of this book. Even so, the stories are still fresh and engaging. Because they have 88 to choose from, you will find there will be at least a few stories each child falls in love with and goes back to time after time.&lt;br /&gt;
To have compiled such a volume in the 1880&amp;rsquo;s is nothing short of amazing. That the stories are of such quality is testament to the efforts of Charles Foster and his publishing house.&lt;br /&gt;
WE INVITE YOU to curl up in front of your hearth with the fire crackling and spitting. Then open this unique sliver of culture not seen in print for many a year; and immerse yourself in the tales and fables of America when it was still a young and growing country.&lt;br /&gt;
