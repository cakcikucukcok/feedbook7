  <title>The Star Child - Paul The Astronaut</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a distant galaxy, Paul the Astronaut peers into his Golden Telescope, focuses the lens, and finally sees the perfect audience for his story. Moments later, his purple book soars through Earths night sky toward the home of a little girl who cannot sleep. After she hears a thud outside her window, Susie finds the book with a glowing golden star on the cover, turns the pages, and becomes immersed in the story about a boy from the moon.&lt;p&gt;
At the bottom of the crater where a shooting star crashes, a Star Child is born on an old, desolate moon. Star grows up learning lessons from the Moon and dreaming of living on the blue planet, Esperanza, which his moon orbits. Despite the Moons objections, Star soon discovers he has little interest in anything beyond Esperanza. When his desires to walk in the green grass, feel the suns warm rays, and run in the yellow sand become so strong he cannot ignore them, Star risks everything to follow his heart and chase his dreams.&lt;p&gt;
In this story for children, a boy from the moon learns that nothing is more important than living fully and as powerful as true love.&lt;p&gt;" />
