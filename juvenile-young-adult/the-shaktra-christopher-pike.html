  <title>The Shaktra - Christopher Pike</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Alosha&lt;/i&gt;, Ali Warner discovered that she was not an ordinary teenager but actually Queen of the Fairies.  Through seven terrifying trials, Ali reclaimed her magical powers and managed to defeat an elemental army that was preparing to destroy the Earth.  At the same time, she took possession of the Yanti, a mystical talisman whose powers she has barely begun to understand. &lt;br&gt;Now Ali searches for her missing mother in the elemental world.  Accompanied by an African youth she meets on the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro, and by the troll and leprechaun who are her faithful companions, Ali faces new dangers at every turn. &lt;br&gt;Attacked by nearly indestructible creatures born of a nightmare, a wounded Ali and her friends are rescued by a young dragon, Drash, who vows to accompany them to the mysterious Crystal Palace, the center of Fairy power.  There Ali learns that the elemental world is on the verge of destruction at the hands of a sinister being known only as the Shaktra.&lt;br&gt;Back on Earth, Ali&#39;s two closest friends, Steve and Cindy, investigate the beautiful and bewitching Sheri Smith, head of a video game company, who seems connected to the Shaktra.  Too late, Steve and Cindy discover that she is not a woman at all... &lt;br&gt;In the elemental world, Ali helps transform Drash into a mighty fire-breathing dragon.  With his help, Ali is able to travel to a secret ice cavern hidden on a kloudar, a massive island that orbits through the elemental heavens.  There Ali discovers the true relationship between humans and the elementals and the hideous nature of the enemy she must face.  For Ali&#39;s quest will not be complete until either she or the Shaktra is dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
