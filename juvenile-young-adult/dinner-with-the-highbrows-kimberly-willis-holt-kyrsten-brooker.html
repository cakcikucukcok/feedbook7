  <title>Dinner with the Highbrows - Kimberly Willis Holt, Kyrsten Brooker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bernard has never been to dinner at a friend&#39;s house before. His mother gives him quite the list of rules to follow--no elbows on the table, put your napkin on your lap, don&#39;t talk with food in your mouth, and so on. But Bernard isn&#39;t prepared to discover that the Goldsmiths think the table is the best place for elbows and feet, never put their napkins on their laps, and talk with food in their mouths! How will Bernard survive dinner with such an obnoxious crew?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimberly Willis Holt&#39;s funny picture book about manners and etiquette turns the idea of good manners upside-down. The fresh point of view in &lt;i&gt;Dinner with the Highbrows&lt;/i&gt; will be appreciated by both kids and their parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Christy Ottaviano Book&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
