  <title>A Lite Too Bright - Samuel Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For fans of literary classics such as &lt;em&gt;The Catcher in the Rye &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&lt;/em&gt; comes a stirring new thought-provoking novel from debut author Sam Miller about a loss shrouded in mystery with twists and turns down every railway.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arthur Louis Pullman the Third&amp;#160;is on the verge of a breakdown. He&amp;#8217;s been stripped of his college scholarship, is losing his grip on reality, and has been sent away to live with his aunt and uncle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s there that Arthur discovers a journal written by his grandfather, the first Arthur Louis Pullman, an iconic Salinger-esque author who went missing the last week of his life and died hundreds of miles away from their family home. What happened in that week&amp;#8212;and how much his actions were influenced by his Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8212;remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now Arthur has his grandfather&amp;#8217;s journal&amp;#8212;and a final sentence containing a train route and a destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Arthur embarks on a cross-country train ride to relive his grandfather&amp;#8217;s last week, guided only by the clues left behind in the dementia-fueled journal. As Arthur gets closer to uncovering a sad and terrible truth, his journey is complicated by a shaky alliance with a girl who has secrets of her own and by escalating run-ins with a dangerous Pullman fan base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arthur&amp;#8217;s not the only one chasing a legacy&amp;#8212;and some feel there is no cost too high for the truth. &lt;/p&gt;" />
