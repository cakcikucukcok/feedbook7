  <title>Super Grandma and Super Grandpa: the Unknown Superheroes Book 1 - Christine J. Gilbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the suburbs of the city lived a Super Grandma, Jeanne Classyca, who had two grandchildren. Super Grandma was a special agent, and she had super magical powers. She was a classy lady and believed in eating the right foods and exercising. 
Not far away downtown in the city lived a Super Grandpa, Patrizio Wannabee, who had three grandchildren. He was a special agent and had super magical powers. He didnt believe in eating healthy or exercising. One would describe him as a bit chunky, until Agent Classyca encouraged him to eat healthy and work out. 
Super Grandma and Super Grandpa were unknown superheroes and worked together on cases involving saving children in danger by using their super magical powers. They each owned a safety training school that taught safety and martial arts to children to make them aware of stranger danger, stop drop and roll, cyber bullying, and more.
While they were working on a case, evidence was found in a wooden box, and they discovered their students and grandchildren were in danger. It was up to Super Grandma and Super Grandpa to catch the criminals by using their super magical powers. While they were trying to catch the criminals, something unexpected happened, and their super magical powers may have been handed down to their grandchildren." />
