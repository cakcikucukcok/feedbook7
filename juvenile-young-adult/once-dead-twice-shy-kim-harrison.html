  <title>Once Dead, Twice Shy - Kim Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is Madison Avery, and I&#39;m here to tell you that there&#39;s more out there than you can see, hear, or touch. Because I&#39;m there. Seeing it. Touching it. Living it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madison&#39;s prom was killer&amp;#8212;literally. For some reason she&#39;s been targeted by a dark reaper&amp;#8212;yeah, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; kind of reaper&amp;#8212;intent on getting rid of her, body and soul. But before the reaper could finish the job, Madison was able to snag his strange, glowing amulet and get away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now she&#39;s stuck on Earth&amp;#8212;dead but not gone. Somehow the amulet gives her the illusion of a body, allowing her to toe the line between life and death. She still doesn&#39;t know why the dark reaper is after her, but she&#39;s not about to just sit around and let fate take its course. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a little ingenuity, some light-bending, and the help of a light reaper (one of the good guys! Maybe . . . ), her cute crush, and oh yeah, her guardian angel, Madison&#39;s ready to take control of her own destiny once and for all, before &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; takes control of &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, if she believed in that stuff. &lt;/p&gt;" />
