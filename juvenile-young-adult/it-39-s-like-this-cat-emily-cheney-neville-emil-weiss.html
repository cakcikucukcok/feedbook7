  <title>It&#39;s Like This, Cat - Emily Cheney Neville, Emil Weiss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Newbery-winning classic novel about a young New Yorker who figures out the world on his own terms with the help of one prickly tomcat, for readers who enjoy such books as&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Al Capone Does My Shirts &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Hoot&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Mitchell and his father disagree on almost everything&amp;#8212;and every time their fighting sets off his mother&amp;#8217;s asthma, Dave ends up storming out of the house. But when Dave meets a big, handsome tomcat, he decides to bring him home, no matter what his father has to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With adventure-loving Cat around, Dave meets lots of new people&amp;#8212;like Tom, a young dropout on his own in the city, and Mary, the first girl he can talk to like a real person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as his eyes open to those around him, Dave starts to understand his father a little better. They still don&amp;#8217;t see eye-to-eye on a lot of things, but there is one thing they can both agree on: Having a cat can be very educational&amp;#8212;especially when it&amp;#8217;s one like Cat.&lt;/p&gt;" />
