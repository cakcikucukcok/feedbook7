  <title>HAUSA FOLKLORE - 22 West African Tales and Stories - Unknown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="22 West African folk and children&amp;#39;s stories, translated and retold by R Sutherland-Rattray.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This volume recounts 22 West African Hausa tales of the origin of the spider, of beautiful maidens, of how hartebeest came by the teardrops under their eyes, of witches, of doctors riding hyenas on pilgrimages, of the cause of thunder, The Gaawoo-tree and the maiden, and the first person who ever went mad and many more. Some of these tales are more fairy, or folk, than legend and others more folk than fairy. Each story imparts a clear message about right and wrong while showing what colour and variety lies hidden in the monotone of the Sahara. However, understanding the Hausa culture requires an understanding of Islam itself&amp;mdash;a task that can seem near insurmountable when the student is from a Western background.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When R. Sutherland Rattray joined the School of Anthropology at Exeter College, Oxford, he had already published&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Chinyanja Folklore &lt;/i&gt;which documented the tales and customs of the Chinyanja of Central Africa. He was also quite familiar with several West African languages. Therefore on his transfer to West Africa learning about the Hausa language and culture became another string in his already full bow and it was only a matter of time before &lt;i&gt;Hausa Folklore&lt;/i&gt; was published.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
33% of the profit from the sale of this book will be donated to the Westville Boys High Scholarship Fund enabling gifted but underprivileged South Africans obtain a first class High School education. So curl up with these unique West African stories from yesteryear with the knowledge that you have helped sponsor the education of an underprivileged African youth.&lt;br /&gt;
As the Hausa say: &amp;ldquo;If you are not going to drink the pap, stop stirring it.&amp;rdquo; The pap is excellent&amp;mdash;so drink!&lt;br /&gt;
