  <title>BRIAR ROSE - A European Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 332&lt;br /&gt;
In this 332nd issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the European Fairy Tale - &amp;quot;BRIAR ROSE&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
At the christening of a king and queen&amp;#39;s long-wished-for child, seven good fairies are invited to be godmothers to the infant princess. The fairies attend the banquet at the palace. Each fairy is presented with a golden plate and drinking cups adorned with jewels. Soon after, an old fairy enters the palace and is seated with a plate of fine china and a crystal drinking glass.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This old fairy had been overlooked because she had been within a tower for many years and everyone had believed her to be deceased. Six of the other seven fairies then offer their gifts of beauty, wit, grace, dance, song, and goodness to the infant princess.&lt;br /&gt;
However, the evil fairy is very angry about having been forgotten, and as her gift, enchants the infant princess so that she will one day prick her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel and die. The seventh fairy, who hasn&amp;#39;t yet given her gift, attempts to reverse the evil fairy&amp;#39;s curse. However, she can only partially offset the curse. The gift she gives is that instead of dying, the Princess will fall into a deep sleep for 100 years and can only be awakened by a kiss from a king&amp;#39;s son.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In an attempt to save his daughter from the terrible curse, the King orders that every spindle and spinning wheel in the kingdom to be destroyed. Fifteen or sixteen years pass and one day, when the king and queen are away, the Princess wanders through the palace rooms and comes upon an old woman, spinning with her spindle. What happens next you ask? Will the curse come to fruition or will it be averted? Will the princess prick her finger and sleep for a hundred years and will she be aoken by a handsome prince, the son of a king?&lt;br /&gt;
Well to find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
