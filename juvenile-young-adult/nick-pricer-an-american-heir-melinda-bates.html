  <title>Nick Pricer—An American Heir - Melinda Bates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Nick Pricer receives a notification that his mothers great aunt Helen has died he is surprised to learn that she has left him her entire estate. The only catch is that Nick and his family must move to England so Nick can attend a prestigious all-boys school called Berkshire. Although hes both excited and scared, Nick agrees to go with his parents and survey the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the Pricers arrive at the estate in England, they quickly learn that there is much more at stake than they thought. There is a full staff in the home and a chauffeur who will drive them wherever they ask. Nick quickly makes friends with a girl named Rose, and everything seems wonderful. But all is not as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determined to take over Aunt Helens estate, her lawyers will stop at nothing to make Nick and his family want to leave and forfeit the fortune. When the family finds more than they bargained for on the estate, they are propelled into a world of national intrigue and historic revelation. Only time will tell if theyll remain safe, or if the mystery will endanger the entire family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
