  <title>Spin the Globe: the Incredible Adventures of Frederick Von Wigglebottom - Edward Moldenhauer, Kenn Yapsangco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Spin the Globe: The Incredible Adventures of Frederick von Wigglebottom is a fact-based and educational book series based on bedtime stories I told my daughter and son. Each night they would ask Daddy to tell them a story. After exhausting every variation of bunny, frog, knight, and princess stories I could come up with, one evening I took notice of the globe that sat atop their dresser. I asked them to help me with a story topic and had them spin the globe! They would use their finger to stop the globe, and wherever their finger landed, I had to tell them an impromptu story about that particular country or area.
This particular story of the series takes place in the city of Trondheim on the coast of Norway. Frederick meets Nikolina, a girl of Viking heritage, and Erik, a Smi boy who teaches him about this area of Scandinavia in the Land of the Midnight Sun." />
