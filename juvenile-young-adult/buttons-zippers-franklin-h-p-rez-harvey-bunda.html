  <title>Buttons &amp; Zippers - Franklin H. Pérez, Harvey Bunda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Meet Little Mike and his cousin Joshua; they have engaged in a fierce race. One night, the little boys are getting ready to go to sleep when they decide to have a race to find out who can get into their pajamas quicker. Little Mikes pants and shirts both have buttons on them. Joshuas clothes have zippers. They decide to battle it out every night to see who will win. Off they go! Little Mike is quicker and finishes putting them on first. At the end, they both win, but little Mike wants to race again. They decide to go to the master in order to see if they can race again. 
Buttons &amp; Zippers is a picture book for the beginner reader. I was inspired by my son to write this book. This story reflects the day-to-day life of many pre-K to second graders in their struggle to surpass their opponents." />
